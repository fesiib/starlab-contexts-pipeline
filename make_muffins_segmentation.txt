### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
1. Identify at least one aspect of a task context that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to highlighted pieces of information. You can list multiple aspects if you can, but make sure they are orthogonal (i.e., do not overlap with respect to type).
2. Classify which type of aspect it belongs to ("when", "why", "where", "what", or "how").
3. Briefly justify the choice of the aspect and the type of segmentation.
4. Describe how the task can be segmented or divided along this aspect.  
5. Provide brief "guidelines" that explain how to identify segment boundaries or assign labels based on the transcript of a tutorial. 
6. Provide "segment labels" (≤3 words) for each of the two highlighted pieces.

### ANNOTATION GUIDELINES
- Use only the transcript text to infer the distinction.
- Keep aspect titles short and interpretable (≤2-3 words).
- Keep segment labels short and interpretable (≤3 words).

### INPUTS
[Information 1]: ```
Butter and flour half of the muffin tins as a release method. Coat butter across the muffin cavity, add a good dash of flour, move the flour around, and dump out the excess flour. Use paper muffin liners for the rest of the tin cavities to produce taller muffins but with less crisp edge. Paper liners go a bit higher and prevent the mushroom-shaped muffin top while still allowing a nice dome. Transfer batter into the muffin tin. 
*If you prefer a nice crispy muffin edge, bake without paper liners.*
When baking without paper liners, be careful to add enough butter and flour so muffins pop out easily. Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer batter into the muffin tin. Fill the muffin cavities all the way to the top for big bakery-style muffins. Normally cupcake batter fills two-thirds of the way, but for these muffins the cups should be filled full. When filling paper liners, avoid getting batter on the edges to prevent burning. ```

ROLE: user

You are analyzing aspects of a task context (a particular temporal segmentation) for tutorials for Making Muffins.

### INPUTS
- Aspects of a task context, each labeled with an ID in square brackets (e.g., "[F1] ..."):  
[F1] (what) Ingredient type (Plural: Ingredient types) -- Divide the ingredients list into categories by the kind of ingredient (e.g., flours, grains/oats, sugars, fats, seeds, flavorings). Each listed item is assigned to the category that best matches the noun in the phrase.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- Read each ingredient line and identify the head noun(s) (e.g., 'flour', 'rolled oats', 'brown sugar', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a broader ingredient category: 'flour' -> Flour/Flour mix; 'oats' -> Oats/Grain; 'brown sugar' -> Sugar; 'butter' -> Fat; 'pumpkin seeds' -> Seeds/Nuts.
- If a phrase contains modifiers (e.g., 'not instant', 'packed', 'softened'), ignore modifiers for category assignment but preserve them for detail.
- Assign a single category label per ingredient line. When an ingredient could belong to multiple categories, prefer the most specific category matching the head noun.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Flour
Definition: '1/2 cup flour' — a ground-wheat baking flour ingredient; categorized under flours/baking dry base.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Rolled oats
Definition: '1/2 cup rolled oats (not instant)' — a whole-grain oat ingredient; categorized under oats/grains.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F2] (when) Stage (Plural: Stages) -- Divide the recipe transcript into temporal stages such as Preparation/Setup (decisions to make before or at the start), Transfer/Filling (actions of putting batter into tins), and Baking/Execution (steps and precautions taken while baking). Each highlighted sentence should be labeled according to which stage it belongs to: whether it is advising a preparation choice or an execution-time precaution.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- Label a sentence as 'Preparation' if it gives a choice, preference, or setup instruction that should be decided or done before filling or baking (words like 'if you prefer', 'use', 'choose', or describing outcome trade-offs).
- Label a sentence as 'Execution' if it warns or instructs about what to do during the action of baking or immediately before placing tins in the oven (phrases like 'when baking', 'be careful', or step-specific cautions).
- Use adjacent context to determine timing: sentences immediately preceding 'transfer batter' or 'fill the muffin cavities' are likely Preparation; sentences referencing 'when baking' or the act of removing from oven are Execution.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Guidance or choice to make before or at setup (e.g., whether to use paper liners to alter final texture).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Execution
Definition: Precautions or step-specific instructions to follow during the baking/firing stage or while performing the action (e.g., how to ensure muffins pop out when baking without liners).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F3] (why) Outcome (Plural: Outcomes) -- Partition guidance by the purpose or subgoal it serves: Aesthetic/Texture outcomes (instructions that explain how to achieve a particular look or texture), Release/Removal outcomes (instructions meant to ensure easy removal or avoid sticking), and Safety/Quality outcomes (prevent burning, improve bake quality). Each highlighted sentence is labeled according to the primary outcome it addresses.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- If the sentence describes how something will look or feel (crisp edge, taller muffins, dome), label it as 'Aesthetic/Texture'.
- If the sentence describes ensuring the muffin can be removed easily or preventing sticking, label it as 'Release/Removal'.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or affecting bake quality, label it as 'Safety/Quality'.
- When a sentence mentions both appearance and a functional effect, choose the label corresponding to the main verb or the explicit goal described.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Aesthetic
Definition: Instructions whose primary goal is to change appearance or texture (e.g., baking without liners for a crispy edge).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```

```
[S2] Release
Definition: Instructions aimed at ensuring easy removal from pan or preventing sticking (e.g., add enough butter/flour when baking without liners).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F4] (what) Focus Object (Plural: Focus Objects) -- Divide the recipe content by the main physical/object focus being described: ingredients or components that go inside the muffins (fillings) versus components that go on top or outside (toppings/streusel) versus general product descriptors.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- Look for nouns that name ingredients or components (e.g., 'blueberries', 'streusel', 'batter').
- If the sentence describes something that will be mixed into the batter, label as 'Filling' or 'Interior'.
- If the sentence describes something that will be applied on top or as a finish, label as 'Topping' or 'Exterior'.
- If the sentence describes the overall muffin (texture, moistness), label as 'Product description'.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Filling
Definition: An ingredient intended to be mixed into the muffin batter (e.g., blueberries).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Topping
Definition: A component applied on top or as a finish to the muffin (e.g., brown sugar streusel).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F5] (why) Purpose (Plural: Purposes) -- Segment content by the intended role or goal of the mentioned element in the recipe: core/flavoring ingredient, finishing/texture enhancer, or general product claims.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- If the sentence emphasizes the main ingredient that defines the recipe (e.g., 'loaded with blueberries'), label as 'Core ingredient'.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element that modifies appearance or texture (e.g., 'topped with streusel'), label as 'Finish/topping'.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist), label as 'Product claim/description'.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Core ingredient
Definition: Describes an ingredient that defines the recipe's main flavor or identity (blueberries).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Finish/topping
Definition: Describes an element added as a topping or finishing touch to affect texture/appearance (brown sugar streusel).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F6] (what) Property type (Plural: Property types) -- Split statements that describe banana characteristics into categories by the kind of attribute they claim (e.g., texture, flavor, ripeness/visual). Each statement in the transcript that asserts a property should be labeled according to which attribute it describes.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- Look for short declarative claims about bananas ("X are Y").
- Assign 'Texture' when the claim concerns firmness, softness, or mouthfeel (words like firm, soft, chewy).
- Assign 'Flavor' when the claim concerns taste, sweetness, or flavor quality (words like flavor, taste, sweet, bitter).
- Assign 'Ripeness' when the claim describes color/state related to maturation (green, ripe, overripe).
- If a claim mentions multiple attributes, choose the primary attribute emphasized in the sentence.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Texture
Definition: Claims about firmness or physical feel of the banana (e.g., 'firmer').
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Flavor
Definition: Claims about taste or flavor quality of the banana (e.g., 'better flavor').
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S3] Ripeness
Definition: Statements explicitly about how green/ripe the banana is or about ripening state.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F7] (why) Informational role (Plural: Informational roles) -- Label each highlighted statement according to whether it functions primarily as an explanation of a preference/observation (justification) or as an explicit factor to use when deciding what to buy (decision criterion/tip).
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- If the sentence explains why the household prefers a certain banana (gives reason/observation), label as 'Justification'.
- If the sentence is presented as a factor to consider when choosing how many or which bananas to buy, label as 'Decision factor'.
- Look at surrounding sentences: if the claim is immediately linked to 'decide' or 'consider when deciding', prefer 'Decision factor'.
- When a claim both explains and informs buying, choose the role most central to the sentence's placement and wording.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving a reason for a household preference or observation.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Decision factor
Definition: A statement framed as a consideration or criterion to use when deciding what to buy.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```

### GOAL
Combine the given aspects of a task context to get a set of aspects of a task context that:
- Are orthogonal (the segmentation wrt one aspect does not deterministically fix the segmentation wrt another aspect).
- Are single-slot (the segmentation title and labels are one short phrase <3 words).
- Cover all initial aspects of a task context.

### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
Iterate until stable:
1) Check for orthogonality:
    - Redefine or replace non-orthogonal pairs with independent aspects of a task context.  
    - Example (WRONG: not independent):  
        - [F3] Physical settings
        - [F4] Settings
        - Settings are more general than physical settings, so can focus on one of the two.
    - Example (CORRECT: independent redesign):  
        - [F4] Settings
2) Check for single-slot:
    - Rephrase aspects of a task context so that segmentation title and labels fit in less than 3 words.
    - Example (WRONG: too long):  
        - [F5] Task phase segmentation
    - Example (CORRECT: single-slot):  
        - [F5] Phases
4) Check for coverage:
    - Ensure the new set preserves all the meaning of the original aspects of a task context.

### EXIT CONDITION
The final aspect set is smallest, orthogonal, single-slot, and fully covers the initial set.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] On crisp fall mornings, warm your belly with a breakfast that celebrates one of the most popular flavors of fall: pumpkin spice latte muffins. It only takes about 30 minutes to make these streusel-topped muffins, from start to delicious finish.
[2 - 3] Things You'll Need
[3 - 4] 1/2 cup rolled oats (not instant)
[4 - 5] 1/2 cup flour
[5 - 6] 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
[6 - 7] 1/2 cup roasted pumpkin seeds
[7 - 8] 1/4 cup butter, softened
[8 - 9] 2 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
[9 - 10] 3 Tbsp. espresso powder
[10 - 11] 2 tsp. baking soda
[11 - 12] 1 tsp. salt
[12 - 13] 1 can of pumpkin pie filling, 15 oz.
[13 - 14] 1/4 cup sugar
[14 - 15] 1 cup brown sugar, packed
[15 - 16] 1 cup vegetable oil
[16 - 17] 4 large eggs
[17 - 18] 1 cup white chocolate chips
[18 - 19] Cupcake liners
[19 - 20] Muffin pan
[21 - 22] 1. Make the streusel topping
[22 - 23] To begin, heat the oven to 350°F. Place paper liners in a muffin pan and set aside.
[24 - 25] In a small bowl, combine the rolled oats, 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, roasted pumpkin seeds, and softened butter. Combine thoroughly and set aside (to use as the streusel topping later).
[26 - 27] 2. Mix the flour base for the muffins
[27 - 28] Sift together 2 2/3 cups of flour, 3 tablespoons of espresso powder, 2 teaspoons of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[29 - 30] 3. Make the pumpkin mixture
[30 - 31] Combine the pumpkin pie filling, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 cup of brown sugar, and 1 cup of vegetable oil. Lightly beat 4 large eggs. Add to the mixture and mix well.
[32 - 33] 4. Combine the wet ingredients with the flour base
[33 - 34] Make a small well in the dry ingredients, and then add the wet ingredients. Stir to moisten.
[35 - 36] 5. Add the chocolate chips
[36 - 37] Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.
[38 - 39] 6. Fill the liners and top with streusel
[39 - 40] Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each liner about 2/3 full. Top each muffin with the streusel.
[41 - 42] 7. Bake the muffins
[42 - 43] Bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Serve warm.    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] Classic blueberry muffins are nearly impossible to beat. Sweet, fluffy and studded with tangy blueberries, these muffins are always a favorite for breakfast, brunch or a snack. This easy blueberry muffin recipe is a keeper for anytime you're in need of a comforting treat. With plenty of room for adaptation, you can make these muffins gluten-free, refined sugar-free or dairy-free.
[2 - 3] Things You'll Need
[3 - 4] 3 cups all-purpose flour
[4 - 5] 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
[5 - 6] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[6 - 7] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[7 - 8] 2 eggs, lightly beaten
[8 - 9] 1 cup buttermilk
[9 - 10] 1/2 cup canola oil
[10 - 11] 1 2/3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
[12 - 13] Preparation
[13 - 14] Heat the oven to 375 F. Coat a muffin tray with nonstick spray, or line your muffin tray with baking cups. Mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk and canola oil.
[14 - 15] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls}
[15 - 16] Stir together the dry ingredients until well combined. Similarly, whisk together the wet ingredients until combined.
[17 - 18] {image caption}{Stir together the ingredients}
[19 - 20] Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients.}
[23 - 24] Add the blueberries, and gently fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula until just combined.
[25 - 26] {image caption}{Fold blueberries into muffin batter}
[27 - 28] Scoop blueberry muffin batter into the prepared muffin tray, filling the holes 3/4 of the way up.
[29 - 30] {image caption}{Scoop batter into muffin tray}
[31 - 32] Bake them on the center rack for 30 to 35 minutes or until the muffins test clean when poked in the center.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Bake muffins in preheated oven.}
[35 - 36] Allow the muffins to cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve them warm with butter and honey.
[37 - 38] {image caption}{Allow muffins to cool before eating.}
[39 - 40] Tip
[40 - 41] To make these muffins gluten-free, you can replace the regular all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour. For a dairy-free recipe, replace the buttermilk with unsweetened almond milk. If you are avoiding refined sugar, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar. You also can use coconut oil or grapeseed oil instead of canola oil.
[42 - 43] Note that bake times may differ for those who live at high elevation.    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Going to the grocery store has turned into an epic quest to find the perfect bananas. In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.
[2 - 3] But no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.
[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.
[6 - 7] Since this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...
[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients
[9 - 10] For the Bread:
[10 - 11] 3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed
[11 - 12] 2 Cups all-purpose Flour
[12 - 13] 3/4 Cup White Sugar
[13 - 14] 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar
[14 - 15] 1 Stick Butter, Softened
[15 - 16] 2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten
[16 - 17] 1 tsp Vanilla
[17 - 18] 1 tsp Baking Soda
[18 - 19] 1/2 tsp Salt
[20 - 21] For the Topping:
[21 - 22] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
[22 - 23] 1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
[23 - 24] 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
[25 - 26] Optional:
[26 - 27] 1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped
[28 - 29] Oven Temp:
[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas
[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...
[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.
[36 - 37] Keep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.
[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start
[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.
[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up
[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.
[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend
[45 - 46] Finally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable.
[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It...
[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.
[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It
[51 - 52] In case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched.
[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that...

[1 - 2] There are so many things to love about this one-bowl oatmeal protein muffin recipe: It's low in sugar, flexible with substitutions and includes three simple sources of protein (nut butter, chia seeds, and flaxseed). But best of all... these muffins are seriously delicious.
[3 - 4] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with chocolate chips and banana chips}
[5 - 6] Things You'll Need
[6 - 7] 3 very ripe bananas (or 1 cup of applesauce)
[7 - 8] 1 cup milk (dairy, coconut, or almond)
[8 - 9] 1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)
[9 - 10] 2 eggs
[10 - 11] 1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey)
[11 - 12] 1 teaspoon vanilla
[12 - 13] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[13 - 14] 1/4 cup flaxseed (ground)
[14 - 15] 1 tablespoon chia seeds
[15 - 16] 3 cups whole oats
[16 - 17] Optional toppings: chocolate chips, dried banana chips
[18 - 19] Tip
[19 - 20] The peanut butter-banana base can be adapted to suit many different tastes. Applesauce works in place of bananas and any nut butter can pinch hit for the peanut butter.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Ingredients for oatmeal protein muffins}
[23 - 24] Get Started
[24 - 25] Set your oven to 375 degrees F and grease the muffin pan. Use coconut oil, spray or butter to grease your pan. Next, mash your bananas in a large mixing bowl.
[26 - 27] {image caption}{When it comes to baking with bananas, the browner the better. They'll have more flavor.}
[28 - 29] {image caption}{A potato masher works best but a fork would also do for very ripe bananas.}
[30 - 31] Add the Remaining Ingredients
[31 - 32] There's no way to mess this up. Simply combine all the ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Use regular milk, almond milk or coconut milk.}
[35 - 36] {image caption}{No need to beat the eggs ahead of time, just crack and mix.}
[37 - 38] {image caption}{We used maple syrup here but honey is also delicious.}
[39 - 40] {image caption}{Make this recipe gluten-free with specially marked containers of whole oats.}
[41 - 42] {image caption}{Without flour in the recipe, there's no worry of over-mixing.}
[43 - 44] Prepare to Bake
[44 - 45] Fill muffin cups to the top. A 3-ounce ice cream scoop works perfectly for evenly distributing muffin batter into pans. This is the time to add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips.
[46 - 47] {image caption}{Tip: Place a couple of chocolate or banana chips in the bottom of each cup before ladling in the batter.}
[48 - 49] {image caption}{Try using coconut oil spray to grease the pan. It's delicious!}
[50 - 51] Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Then cool on a rack.
[52 - 53] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with banana chips on top}
[54 - 55] Store refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. Or freeze in a single layer, inside a zip-top freezer bag.
[56 - 57] {image caption}{Mix and match your toppings, or add more.}    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] Homemade muffins are a special addition to breakfast or brunch. Enjoy them with friends and family, or make them as a grab-and-go breakfast for busy work weeks. Warmly spiced with cinnamon, Morning Glory muffins are made with grated carrot, apple, raisins, walnuts, shredded coconut, and sometimes pineapple. While the list of ingredients is long, the process for baking these muffins is simple and well worth the required steps.
[2 - 3] ​​This recipe makes 12 muffins. ​
[4 - 5] Things You'll Need
[5 - 6] 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
[6 - 7] 1 cup shredded coconut
[7 - 8] 3/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed
[8 - 9] 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
[9 - 10] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[10 - 11] 1 teaspoon baking powder
[11 - 12] 1 cup grated carrot (about 1 large carrot, peeled and grated)
[12 - 13] 1 cup grated apple (about 1/2 large apple such as Honeycrisp)
[13 - 14] 1/2 cup raisins
[14 - 15] 1/2 cup raw walnuts, chopped
[15 - 16] 2 large eggs
[16 - 17] 1/4 cup olive oil or canola oil
[17 - 18] 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
[18 - 19] Box grater
[19 - 20] 2 mixing bowls
[20 - 21] Spoon or fork for mixing
[21 - 22] 12 disposable baking cups
[22 - 23] 12-hole muffin tray
[23 - 24] Tip
[24 - 25] To save time, use a food processor to shred the carrot and apple.
[25 - 26] Not a fan of gluten? Replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour.
[26 - 27] For naturally sweetened, refined sugar-free muffins, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.
[27 - 28] You can choose to use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut.
[28 - 29] Instructions:
[29 - 30] Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate 1 cup-worth of carrot, and 1 cup-worth of apple.
[31 - 32] Add the flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to a mixing and stir together.
[33 - 34] Add the grated carrot, apple, raisins, and walnuts to the flour mixture and stir to combine.
[35 - 36] In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, and vanilla extract.
[37 - 38] Add the egg mixture to the bowl with the flour mixture and stir well until a thick batter forms.
[39 - 40] Line a 12-hole muffin pan with baking cups. Scoop batter into the pan using an ice cream scoop or small measuring cup, filling the holes 2/3 of the way up.
[41 - 42] Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until muffins test clean when poked with a toothpick.
[43 - 44] Allow muffins to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] These are my blueberry muffins.
[4 - 5] Mmm, my favorite muffin.
[5 - 12] To a large mixing bowl, add grated lemon zest, a milk of choice, we're using soy milk, sugar, a neutral vegetable oil, and vanilla extract.
[12 - 14] Whisk well until the ingredients are well combined.
[14 - 18] Now, sift in the flour with baking powder and a pinch of salt.
[18 - 20] This is gonna make your muffin soft and fluffy.
[20 - 24] Whisk wet and dry ingredients for a short minute until lumps are gone, but without overmixing.
[24 - 29] Rinse the blueberries, shake the water off, then add them to a bowl, toss them with the cornstarch, and add them to the batter.
[29 - 31] Stir and fold the blueberries in the mixture gently.
[31 - 33] Transfer the batter to the muffin liners.
[33 - 35] You should be able to make 12 muffins.
[35 - 37] You can fill them almost to the top.
[37 - 39] Then you can sprinkle some sugar on top, or not.
[39 - 40] We're not gonna do it because we eat them for breakfast.
[41 - 46] Then bake in a preheated oven for 22 and a half minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
[46 - 48] Now let them cool down for about 30 minutes.
[48 - 49] Easy, right?

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Ingredient types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Read the ingredient line and identify the head noun (e.g., 'flour', 'oats', 'butter', 'pumpkin seeds').
- Map the head noun to a single broader category (Flour, Oats/Grain, Sugar, Fat, Seeds/Nuts, Liquid, Leavening, Spice/Flavoring, Dairy, Fruit).
- Ignore modifiers that affect form or preparation (e.g., 'softened', 'packed') when assigning the category.
- If ambiguous, pick the most specific category matching the head noun (e.g., 'brown sugar' → Sugar).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[46 - 47] Step 4: Assemble
[47 - 48] Grease your muffin tins or line with paper cups.
[49 - 50] Drop in spoonfuls of pumpkin mixture.
[50 - 51] Add smaller spoonfuls of cream cheese mixture on top.
[51 - 52] Swirl with a skewer.
[53 - 54] Optional:  top with crushed nuts.  Pumpkin seeds (pepitas) are also a great topping!
[55 - 56] Step 5: Bake
[56 - 57] Bake as follows, turning the tins half way through baking times:
[58 - 59] mini muffins: 20-25 min
[59 - 60] standard muffins: 25-30 min

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Mark as 'Preparation' if the sentence indicates choices, setup, or things to do before filling/starting the cooking step (contains 'use', 'choose', 'before', 'if you prefer').
- Mark as 'Execution' if the sentence warns or instructs about what to do during the bake or right before/after placing items in the oven (contains 'when baking', 'remove', 'be careful', step-specific cautions).
- Use nearby sentences to resolve ambiguity: sentences immediately before 'transfer' or 'fill' are likely Preparation; sentences referencing oven time/temperature or removal are Execution.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] Classic blueberry muffins are nearly impossible to beat. Sweet, fluffy and studded with tangy blueberries, these muffins are always a favorite for breakfast, brunch or a snack. This easy blueberry muffin recipe is a keeper for anytime you're in need of a comforting treat. With plenty of room for adaptation, you can make these muffins gluten-free, refined sugar-free or dairy-free.
[2 - 3] Things You'll Need
[3 - 4] 3 cups all-purpose flour
[4 - 5] 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
[5 - 6] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[6 - 7] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[7 - 8] 2 eggs, lightly beaten
[8 - 9] 1 cup buttermilk
[9 - 10] 1/2 cup canola oil
[10 - 11] 1 2/3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
[12 - 13] Preparation
[13 - 14] Heat the oven to 375 F. Coat a muffin tray with nonstick spray, or line your muffin tray with baking cups. Mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk and canola oil.
[14 - 15] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls}
[15 - 16] Stir together the dry ingredients until well combined. Similarly, whisk together the wet ingredients until combined.
[17 - 18] {image caption}{Stir together the ingredients}
[19 - 20] Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients.}
[23 - 24] Add the blueberries, and gently fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula until just combined.
[25 - 26] {image caption}{Fold blueberries into muffin batter}
[27 - 28] Scoop blueberry muffin batter into the prepared muffin tray, filling the holes 3/4 of the way up.
[29 - 30] {image caption}{Scoop batter into muffin tray}
[31 - 32] Bake them on the center rack for 30 to 35 minutes or until the muffins test clean when poked in the center.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Bake muffins in preheated oven.}
[35 - 36] Allow the muffins to cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve them warm with butter and honey.
[37 - 38] {image caption}{Allow muffins to cool before eating.}
[39 - 40] Tip
[40 - 41] To make these muffins gluten-free, you can replace the regular all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour. For a dairy-free recipe, replace the buttermilk with unsweetened almond milk. If you are avoiding refined sugar, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar. You also can use coconut oil or grapeseed oil instead of canola oil.
[42 - 43] Note that bake times may differ for those who live at high elevation.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Going to the grocery store has turned into an epic quest to find the perfect bananas. In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.
[2 - 3] But no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.
[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.
[6 - 7] Since this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...
[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients
[9 - 10] For the Bread:
[10 - 11] 3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed
[11 - 12] 2 Cups all-purpose Flour
[12 - 13] 3/4 Cup White Sugar
[13 - 14] 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar
[14 - 15] 1 Stick Butter, Softened
[15 - 16] 2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten
[16 - 17] 1 tsp Vanilla
[17 - 18] 1 tsp Baking Soda
[18 - 19] 1/2 tsp Salt
[20 - 21] For the Topping:
[21 - 22] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
[22 - 23] 1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
[23 - 24] 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
[25 - 26] Optional:
[26 - 27] 1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped
[28 - 29] Oven Temp:
[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas
[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...
[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.
[36 - 37] Keep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.
[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start
[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.
[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up
[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.
[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend
[45 - 46] Finally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable.
[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It...
[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.
[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It
[51 - 52] In case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched.
[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that...    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Mark as 'Preparation' if the sentence indicates choices, setup, or things to do before filling/starting the cooking step (contains 'use', 'choose', 'before', 'if you prefer').
- Mark as 'Execution' if the sentence warns or instructs about what to do during the bake or right before/after placing items in the oven (contains 'when baking', 'remove', 'be careful', step-specific cautions).
- Use nearby sentences to resolve ambiguity: sentences immediately before 'transfer' or 'fill' are likely Preparation; sentences referencing oven time/temperature or removal are Execution.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[1 - 2] There are so many things to love about this one-bowl oatmeal protein muffin recipe: It's low in sugar, flexible with substitutions and includes three simple sources of protein (nut butter, chia seeds, and flaxseed). But best of all... these muffins are seriously delicious.
[3 - 4] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with chocolate chips and banana chips}
[5 - 6] Things You'll Need
[6 - 7] 3 very ripe bananas (or 1 cup of applesauce)
[7 - 8] 1 cup milk (dairy, coconut, or almond)
[8 - 9] 1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)
[9 - 10] 2 eggs
[10 - 11] 1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey)
[11 - 12] 1 teaspoon vanilla
[12 - 13] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[13 - 14] 1/4 cup flaxseed (ground)
[14 - 15] 1 tablespoon chia seeds
[15 - 16] 3 cups whole oats
[16 - 17] Optional toppings: chocolate chips, dried banana chips
[18 - 19] Tip
[19 - 20] The peanut butter-banana base can be adapted to suit many different tastes. Applesauce works in place of bananas and any nut butter can pinch hit for the peanut butter.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Ingredients for oatmeal protein muffins}
[23 - 24] Get Started
[24 - 25] Set your oven to 375 degrees F and grease the muffin pan. Use coconut oil, spray or butter to grease your pan. Next, mash your bananas in a large mixing bowl.
[26 - 27] {image caption}{When it comes to baking with bananas, the browner the better. They'll have more flavor.}
[28 - 29] {image caption}{A potato masher works best but a fork would also do for very ripe bananas.}
[30 - 31] Add the Remaining Ingredients
[31 - 32] There's no way to mess this up. Simply combine all the ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Use regular milk, almond milk or coconut milk.}
[35 - 36] {image caption}{No need to beat the eggs ahead of time, just crack and mix.}
[37 - 38] {image caption}{We used maple syrup here but honey is also delicious.}
[39 - 40] {image caption}{Make this recipe gluten-free with specially marked containers of whole oats.}
[41 - 42] {image caption}{Without flour in the recipe, there's no worry of over-mixing.}
[43 - 44] Prepare to Bake
[44 - 45] Fill muffin cups to the top. A 3-ounce ice cream scoop works perfectly for evenly distributing muffin batter into pans. This is the time to add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips.
[46 - 47] {image caption}{Tip: Place a couple of chocolate or banana chips in the bottom of each cup before ladling in the batter.}
[48 - 49] {image caption}{Try using coconut oil spray to grease the pan. It's delicious!}
[50 - 51] Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Then cool on a rack.
[52 - 53] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with banana chips on top}
[54 - 55] Store refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. Or freeze in a single layer, inside a zip-top freezer bag.
[56 - 57] {image caption}{Mix and match your toppings, or add more.}

[0 - 1] Homemade muffins are a special addition to breakfast or brunch. Enjoy them with friends and family, or make them as a grab-and-go breakfast for busy work weeks. Warmly spiced with cinnamon, Morning Glory muffins are made with grated carrot, apple, raisins, walnuts, shredded coconut, and sometimes pineapple. While the list of ingredients is long, the process for baking these muffins is simple and well worth the required steps.
[2 - 3] ​​This recipe makes 12 muffins. ​
[4 - 5] Things You'll Need
[5 - 6] 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
[6 - 7] 1 cup shredded coconut
[7 - 8] 3/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed
[8 - 9] 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
[9 - 10] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[10 - 11] 1 teaspoon baking powder
[11 - 12] 1 cup grated carrot (about 1 large carrot, peeled and grated)
[12 - 13] 1 cup grated apple (about 1/2 large apple such as Honeycrisp)
[13 - 14] 1/2 cup raisins
[14 - 15] 1/2 cup raw walnuts, chopped
[15 - 16] 2 large eggs
[16 - 17] 1/4 cup olive oil or canola oil

[19 - 20] 2 mixing bowls
[20 - 21] Spoon or fork for mixing
[21 - 22] 12 disposable baking cups
[22 - 23] 12-hole muffin tray
[23 - 24] Tip
[24 - 25] To save time, use a food processor to shred the carrot and apple.
[25 - 26] Not a fan of gluten? Replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour.
[26 - 27] For naturally sweetened, refined sugar-free muffins, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.
[27 - 28] You can choose to use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut.
[28 - 29] Instructions:
[29 - 30] Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate 1 cup-worth of carrot, and 1 cup-worth of apple.
[31 - 32] Add the flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to a mixing and stir together.
[33 - 34] Add the grated carrot, apple, raisins, and walnuts to the flour mixture and stir to combine.
[35 - 36] In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, and vanilla extract.
[37 - 38] Add the egg mixture to the bowl with the flour mixture and stir well until a thick batter forms.
[39 - 40] Line a 12-hole muffin pan with baking cups. Scoop batter into the pan using an ice cream scoop or small measuring cup, filling the holes 2/3 of the way up.
[41 - 42] Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until muffins test clean when poked with a toothpick.
[43 - 44] Allow muffins to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!

[12 - 14] Whisk well until the ingredients are well combined.
[14 - 18] Now, sift in the flour with baking powder and a pinch of salt.
[18 - 20] This is gonna make your muffin soft and fluffy.
[20 - 24] Whisk wet and dry ingredients for a short minute until lumps are gone, but without overmixing.
[24 - 29] Rinse the blueberries, shake the water off, then add them to a bowl, toss them with the cornstarch, and add them to the batter.
[29 - 31] Stir and fold the blueberries in the mixture gently.
[31 - 33] Transfer the batter to the muffin liners.
[33 - 35] You should be able to make 12 muffins.
[35 - 37] You can fill them almost to the top.
[37 - 39] Then you can sprinkle some sugar on top, or not.
[39 - 40] We're not gonna do it because we eat them for breakfast.
[41 - 46] Then bake in a preheated oven for 22 and a half minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
[46 - 48] Now let them cool down for about 30 minutes.

- Mark as 'Execution' if the sentence warns or instructs about what to do during the bake or right before/after placing items in the oven (contains 'when baking', 'remove', 'be careful', step-specific cautions).
- Use nearby sentences to resolve ambiguity: sentences immediately before 'transfer' or 'fill' are likely Preparation; sentences referencing oven time/temperature or removal are Execution.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.

[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Mark as 'Preparation' if the sentence indicates choices, setup, or things to do before filling/starting the cooking step (contains 'use', 'choose', 'before', 'if you prefer').
- Mark as 'Execution' if the sentence warns or instructs about what to do during the bake or right before/after placing items in the oven (contains 'when baking', 'remove', 'be careful', step-specific cautions).
- Use nearby sentences to resolve ambiguity: sentences immediately before 'transfer' or 'fill' are likely Preparation; sentences referencing oven time/temperature or removal are Execution.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] Classic blueberry muffins are nearly impossible to beat. Sweet, fluffy and studded with tangy blueberries, these muffins are always a favorite for breakfast, brunch or a snack. This easy blueberry muffin recipe is a keeper for anytime you're in need of a comforting treat. With plenty of room for adaptation, you can make these muffins gluten-free, refined sugar-free or dairy-free.
[2 - 3] Things You'll Need
[3 - 4] 3 cups all-purpose flour
[4 - 5] 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
[5 - 6] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[6 - 7] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[7 - 8] 2 eggs, lightly beaten
[8 - 9] 1 cup buttermilk
[9 - 10] 1/2 cup canola oil
[10 - 11] 1 2/3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
[12 - 13] Preparation
[13 - 14] Heat the oven to 375 F. Coat a muffin tray with nonstick spray, or line your muffin tray with baking cups. Mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk and canola oil.
[14 - 15] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls}
[15 - 16] Stir together the dry ingredients until well combined. Similarly, whisk together the wet ingredients until combined.
[17 - 18] {image caption}{Stir together the ingredients}
[19 - 20] Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients.}
[23 - 24] Add the blueberries, and gently fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula until just combined.
[25 - 26] {image caption}{Fold blueberries into muffin batter}
[27 - 28] Scoop blueberry muffin batter into the prepared muffin tray, filling the holes 3/4 of the way up.
[29 - 30] {image caption}{Scoop batter into muffin tray}
[31 - 32] Bake them on the center rack for 30 to 35 minutes or until the muffins test clean when poked in the center.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Bake muffins in preheated oven.}
[35 - 36] Allow the muffins to cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve them warm with butter and honey.
[37 - 38] {image caption}{Allow muffins to cool before eating.}
[39 - 40] Tip
[40 - 41] To make these muffins gluten-free, you can replace the regular all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour. For a dairy-free recipe, replace the buttermilk with unsweetened almond milk. If you are avoiding refined sugar, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar. You also can use coconut oil or grapeseed oil instead of canola oil.
[42 - 43] Note that bake times may differ for those who live at high elevation.    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Going to the grocery store has turned into an epic quest to find the perfect bananas. In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.
[2 - 3] But no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.
[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.
[6 - 7] Since this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...
[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients
[9 - 10] For the Bread:
[10 - 11] 3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed
[11 - 12] 2 Cups all-purpose Flour
[12 - 13] 3/4 Cup White Sugar
[13 - 14] 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar
[14 - 15] 1 Stick Butter, Softened
[15 - 16] 2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten
[16 - 17] 1 tsp Vanilla
[17 - 18] 1 tsp Baking Soda
[18 - 19] 1/2 tsp Salt
[20 - 21] For the Topping:
[21 - 22] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
[22 - 23] 1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
[23 - 24] 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
[25 - 26] Optional:
[26 - 27] 1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped
[28 - 29] Oven Temp:
[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas
[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...
[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.
[36 - 37] Keep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.
[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start
[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.
[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up
[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.
[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend
[45 - 46] Finally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable.
[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It...
[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.
[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It
[51 - 52] In case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched.
[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that...    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[1 - 2] There are so many things to love about this one-bowl oatmeal protein muffin recipe: It's low in sugar, flexible with substitutions and includes three simple sources of protein (nut butter, chia seeds, and flaxseed). But best of all... these muffins are seriously delicious.
[3 - 4] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with chocolate chips and banana chips}
[5 - 6] Things You'll Need
[6 - 7] 3 very ripe bananas (or 1 cup of applesauce)
[7 - 8] 1 cup milk (dairy, coconut, or almond)
[8 - 9] 1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)
[9 - 10] 2 eggs
[10 - 11] 1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey)
[11 - 12] 1 teaspoon vanilla
[12 - 13] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[13 - 14] 1/4 cup flaxseed (ground)
[14 - 15] 1 tablespoon chia seeds
[15 - 16] 3 cups whole oats
[16 - 17] Optional toppings: chocolate chips, dried banana chips
[18 - 19] Tip
[19 - 20] The peanut butter-banana base can be adapted to suit many different tastes. Applesauce works in place of bananas and any nut butter can pinch hit for the peanut butter.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Ingredients for oatmeal protein muffins}
[23 - 24] Get Started
[24 - 25] Set your oven to 375 degrees F and grease the muffin pan. Use coconut oil, spray or butter to grease your pan. Next, mash your bananas in a large mixing bowl.
[26 - 27] {image caption}{When it comes to baking with bananas, the browner the better. They'll have more flavor.}
[28 - 29] {image caption}{A potato masher works best but a fork would also do for very ripe bananas.}
[30 - 31] Add the Remaining Ingredients
[31 - 32] There's no way to mess this up. Simply combine all the ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Use regular milk, almond milk or coconut milk.}
[35 - 36] {image caption}{No need to beat the eggs ahead of time, just crack and mix.}
[37 - 38] {image caption}{We used maple syrup here but honey is also delicious.}
[39 - 40] {image caption}{Make this recipe gluten-free with specially marked containers of whole oats.}
[41 - 42] {image caption}{Without flour in the recipe, there's no worry of over-mixing.}
[43 - 44] Prepare to Bake
[44 - 45] Fill muffin cups to the top. A 3-ounce ice cream scoop works perfectly for evenly distributing muffin batter into pans. This is the time to add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips.
[46 - 47] {image caption}{Tip: Place a couple of chocolate or banana chips in the bottom of each cup before ladling in the batter.}
[48 - 49] {image caption}{Try using coconut oil spray to grease the pan. It's delicious!}
[50 - 51] Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Then cool on a rack.
[52 - 53] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with banana chips on top}
[54 - 55] Store refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. Or freeze in a single layer, inside a zip-top freezer bag.
[56 - 57] {image caption}{Mix and match your toppings, or add more.}    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[23 - 24] Tip
[24 - 25] To save time, use a food processor to shred the carrot and apple.
[25 - 26] Not a fan of gluten? Replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour.
[26 - 27] For naturally sweetened, refined sugar-free muffins, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.
[27 - 28] You can choose to use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut.
[28 - 29] Instructions:
[29 - 30] Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate 1 cup-worth of carrot, and 1 cup-worth of apple.
[31 - 32] Add the flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to a mixing and stir together.
[33 - 34] Add the grated carrot, apple, raisins, and walnuts to the flour mixture and stir to combine.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!

2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains how to achieve a particular look or texture, choose the Aesthetic/Texture label.
- If the sentence aims to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking, choose Release/Removal.
- If the sentence focuses on preventing burning or improving bake quality, choose Safety/Quality.
- If the sentence emphasizes the ingredient as defining the recipe (main flavor), choose Core ingredient.
- If the sentence emphasizes a finishing element or topping, choose Finish/Topping.
- If the sentence describes overall qualities (fluffy, moist) as a claim, choose Product claim.
- When multiple goals are present, pick the primary explicit goal or main verb of the sentence.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Focus objects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence names ingredients to be mixed into batter, label as 'Filling'.
- If it names ingredients applied on top or as a finish, label as 'Topping'.
- If it describes the whole muffin (texture, moistness, final product), label as 'Product'.
- Use verb cues: 'fold in', 'stir into batter' → Filling; 'sprinkle on top', 'top with' → Topping; 'muffins will be' → Product.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] Classic blueberry muffins are nearly impossible to beat. Sweet, fluffy and studded with tangy blueberries, these muffins are always a favorite for breakfast, brunch or a snack. This easy blueberry muffin recipe is a keeper for anytime you're in need of a comforting treat. With plenty of room for adaptation, you can make these muffins gluten-free, refined sugar-free or dairy-free.
[2 - 3] Things You'll Need
[3 - 4] 3 cups all-purpose flour
[4 - 5] 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
[5 - 6] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[6 - 7] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[7 - 8] 2 eggs, lightly beaten
[8 - 9] 1 cup buttermilk
[9 - 10] 1/2 cup canola oil
[10 - 11] 1 2/3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
[12 - 13] Preparation
[13 - 14] Heat the oven to 375 F. Coat a muffin tray with nonstick spray, or line your muffin tray with baking cups. Mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk and canola oil.
[14 - 15] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls}
[15 - 16] Stir together the dry ingredients until well combined. Similarly, whisk together the wet ingredients until combined.
[17 - 18] {image caption}{Stir together the ingredients}
[19 - 20] Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients.}
[23 - 24] Add the blueberries, and gently fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula until just combined.
[25 - 26] {image caption}{Fold blueberries into muffin batter}
[27 - 28] Scoop blueberry muffin batter into the prepared muffin tray, filling the holes 3/4 of the way up.
[29 - 30] {image caption}{Scoop batter into muffin tray}
[31 - 32] Bake them on the center rack for 30 to 35 minutes or until the muffins test clean when poked in the center.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Bake muffins in preheated oven.}
[35 - 36] Allow the muffins to cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve them warm with butter and honey.
[37 - 38] {image caption}{Allow muffins to cool before eating.}
[39 - 40] Tip
[40 - 41] To make these muffins gluten-free, you can replace the regular all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour. For a dairy-free recipe, replace the buttermilk with unsweetened almond milk. If you are avoiding refined sugar, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar. You also can use coconut oil or grapeseed oil instead of canola oil.
[42 - 43] Note that bake times may differ for those who live at high elevation.    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Focus objects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence names ingredients to be mixed into batter, label as 'Filling'.
- If it names ingredients applied on top or as a finish, label as 'Topping'.
- If it describes the whole muffin (texture, moistness, final product), label as 'Product'.
- Use verb cues: 'fold in', 'stir into batter' → Filling; 'sprinkle on top', 'top with' → Topping; 'muffins will be' → Product.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Going to the grocery store has turned into an epic quest to find the perfect bananas. In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.
[2 - 3] But no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.
[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.
[6 - 7] Since this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...
[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients
[9 - 10] For the Bread:
[10 - 11] 3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed
[11 - 12] 2 Cups all-purpose Flour
[12 - 13] 3/4 Cup White Sugar
[13 - 14] 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar
[14 - 15] 1 Stick Butter, Softened
[15 - 16] 2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten
[16 - 17] 1 tsp Vanilla
[17 - 18] 1 tsp Baking Soda
[18 - 19] 1/2 tsp Salt
[20 - 21] For the Topping:
[21 - 22] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
[22 - 23] 1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
[23 - 24] 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
[25 - 26] Optional:
[26 - 27] 1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped
[28 - 29] Oven Temp:
[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas
[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...
[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.
[36 - 37] Keep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.
[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start
[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.
[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up
[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.
[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend
[45 - 46] Finally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable.
[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It...
[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.
[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It
[51 - 52] In case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched.
[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that...

[1 - 2] There are so many things to love about this one-bowl oatmeal protein muffin recipe: It's low in sugar, flexible with substitutions and includes three simple sources of protein (nut butter, chia seeds, and flaxseed). But best of all... these muffins are seriously delicious.
[3 - 4] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with chocolate chips and banana chips}
[5 - 6] Things You'll Need
[6 - 7] 3 very ripe bananas (or 1 cup of applesauce)
[7 - 8] 1 cup milk (dairy, coconut, or almond)
[8 - 9] 1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)
[9 - 10] 2 eggs
[10 - 11] 1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey)
[11 - 12] 1 teaspoon vanilla
[12 - 13] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[13 - 14] 1/4 cup flaxseed (ground)
[14 - 15] 1 tablespoon chia seeds
[15 - 16] 3 cups whole oats
[16 - 17] Optional toppings: chocolate chips, dried banana chips
[18 - 19] Tip
[19 - 20] The peanut butter-banana base can be adapted to suit many different tastes. Applesauce works in place of bananas and any nut butter can pinch hit for the peanut butter.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Ingredients for oatmeal protein muffins}
[23 - 24] Get Started
[24 - 25] Set your oven to 375 degrees F and grease the muffin pan. Use coconut oil, spray or butter to grease your pan. Next, mash your bananas in a large mixing bowl.
[26 - 27] {image caption}{When it comes to baking with bananas, the browner the better. They'll have more flavor.}
[28 - 29] {image caption}{A potato masher works best but a fork would also do for very ripe bananas.}
[30 - 31] Add the Remaining Ingredients
[31 - 32] There's no way to mess this up. Simply combine all the ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Use regular milk, almond milk or coconut milk.}
[35 - 36] {image caption}{No need to beat the eggs ahead of time, just crack and mix.}
[37 - 38] {image caption}{We used maple syrup here but honey is also delicious.}
[39 - 40] {image caption}{Make this recipe gluten-free with specially marked containers of whole oats.}
[41 - 42] {image caption}{Without flour in the recipe, there's no worry of over-mixing.}
[43 - 44] Prepare to Bake
[44 - 45] Fill muffin cups to the top. A 3-ounce ice cream scoop works perfectly for evenly distributing muffin batter into pans. This is the time to add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips.
[46 - 47] {image caption}{Tip: Place a couple of chocolate or banana chips in the bottom of each cup before ladling in the batter.}
[48 - 49] {image caption}{Try using coconut oil spray to grease the pan. It's delicious!}
[50 - 51] Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Then cool on a rack.
[52 - 53] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with banana chips on top}
[54 - 55] Store refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. Or freeze in a single layer, inside a zip-top freezer bag.
[56 - 57] {image caption}{Mix and match your toppings, or add more.}

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Homemade muffins are a special addition to breakfast or brunch. Enjoy them with friends and family, or make them as a grab-and-go breakfast for busy work weeks. Warmly spiced with cinnamon, Morning Glory muffins are made with grated carrot, apple, raisins, walnuts, shredded coconut, and sometimes pineapple. While the list of ingredients is long, the process for baking these muffins is simple and well worth the required steps.
[2 - 3] ​​This recipe makes 12 muffins. ​
[4 - 5] Things You'll Need
[5 - 6] 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
[6 - 7] 1 cup shredded coconut
[7 - 8] 3/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed
[8 - 9] 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
[9 - 10] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[10 - 11] 1 teaspoon baking powder
[11 - 12] 1 cup grated carrot (about 1 large carrot, peeled and grated)
[12 - 13] 1 cup grated apple (about 1/2 large apple such as Honeycrisp)
[13 - 14] 1/2 cup raisins
[14 - 15] 1/2 cup raw walnuts, chopped
[15 - 16] 2 large eggs
[16 - 17] 1/4 cup olive oil or canola oil
[17 - 18] 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
[18 - 19] Box grater
[19 - 20] 2 mixing bowls
[20 - 21] Spoon or fork for mixing
[21 - 22] 12 disposable baking cups
[22 - 23] 12-hole muffin tray
[23 - 24] Tip
[24 - 25] To save time, use a food processor to shred the carrot and apple.
[25 - 26] Not a fan of gluten? Replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour.
[26 - 27] For naturally sweetened, refined sugar-free muffins, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.
[27 - 28] You can choose to use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut.
[28 - 29] Instructions:
[29 - 30] Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate 1 cup-worth of carrot, and 1 cup-worth of apple.
[31 - 32] Add the flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to a mixing and stir together.
[33 - 34] Add the grated carrot, apple, raisins, and walnuts to the flour mixture and stir to combine.
[35 - 36] In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, and vanilla extract.
[37 - 38] Add the egg mixture to the bowl with the flour mixture and stir well until a thick batter forms.
[39 - 40] Line a 12-hole muffin pan with baking cups. Scoop batter into the pan using an ice cream scoop or small measuring cup, filling the holes 2/3 of the way up.
[41 - 42] Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until muffins test clean when poked with a toothpick.
[43 - 44] Allow muffins to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Focus objects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence names ingredients to be mixed into batter, label as 'Filling'.
- If it names ingredients applied on top or as a finish, label as 'Topping'.
- If it describes the whole muffin (texture, moistness, final product), label as 'Product'.
- Use verb cues: 'fold in', 'stir into batter' → Filling; 'sprinkle on top', 'top with' → Topping; 'muffins will be' → Product.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] These are my blueberry muffins.
[4 - 5] Mmm, my favorite muffin.
[5 - 12] To a large mixing bowl, add grated lemon zest, a milk of choice, we're using soy milk, sugar, a neutral vegetable oil, and vanilla extract.
[12 - 14] Whisk well until the ingredients are well combined.
[14 - 18] Now, sift in the flour with baking powder and a pinch of salt.
[18 - 20] This is gonna make your muffin soft and fluffy.
[20 - 24] Whisk wet and dry ingredients for a short minute until lumps are gone, but without overmixing.
[24 - 29] Rinse the blueberries, shake the water off, then add them to a bowl, toss them with the cornstarch, and add them to the batter.
[29 - 31] Stir and fold the blueberries in the mixture gently.
[31 - 33] Transfer the batter to the muffin liners.
[33 - 35] You should be able to make 12 muffins.
[35 - 37] You can fill them almost to the top.
[37 - 39] Then you can sprinkle some sugar on top, or not.
[39 - 40] We're not gonna do it because we eat them for breakfast.
[41 - 46] Then bake in a preheated oven for 22 and a half minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
[46 - 48] Now let them cool down for about 30 minutes.
[48 - 49] Easy, right?

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Focus objects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence names ingredients to be mixed into batter, label as 'Filling'.
- If it names ingredients applied on top or as a finish, label as 'Topping'.
- If it describes the whole muffin (texture, moistness, final product), label as 'Product'.
- Use verb cues: 'fold in', 'stir into batter' → Filling; 'sprinkle on top', 'top with' → Topping; 'muffins will be' → Product.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Focus objects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence names ingredients to be mixed into batter, label as 'Filling'.
- If it names ingredients applied on top or as a finish, label as 'Topping'.
- If it describes the whole muffin (texture, moistness, final product), label as 'Product'.
- Use verb cues: 'fold in', 'stir into batter' → Filling; 'sprinkle on top', 'top with' → Topping; 'muffins will be' → Product.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Property types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Find short declarative claims about an ingredient (pattern 'X is/are Y').
- If it concerns mouthfeel or firmness, label as Texture.
- If it concerns taste or sweetness, label as Flavor.
- If it concerns color or maturity state (green/ripe/overripe), label as Ripeness.
- If multiple attributes are present, pick the primary attribute emphasized.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] Classic blueberry muffins are nearly impossible to beat. Sweet, fluffy and studded with tangy blueberries, these muffins are always a favorite for breakfast, brunch or a snack. This easy blueberry muffin recipe is a keeper for anytime you're in need of a comforting treat. With plenty of room for adaptation, you can make these muffins gluten-free, refined sugar-free or dairy-free.
[2 - 3] Things You'll Need
[3 - 4] 3 cups all-purpose flour
[4 - 5] 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
[5 - 6] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[6 - 7] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[7 - 8] 2 eggs, lightly beaten
[8 - 9] 1 cup buttermilk
[9 - 10] 1/2 cup canola oil
[10 - 11] 1 2/3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
[12 - 13] Preparation
[13 - 14] Heat the oven to 375 F. Coat a muffin tray with nonstick spray, or line your muffin tray with baking cups. Mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk and canola oil.
[14 - 15] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls}
[15 - 16] Stir together the dry ingredients until well combined. Similarly, whisk together the wet ingredients until combined.
[17 - 18] {image caption}{Stir together the ingredients}
[19 - 20] Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients.}
[23 - 24] Add the blueberries, and gently fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula until just combined.
[25 - 26] {image caption}{Fold blueberries into muffin batter}
[27 - 28] Scoop blueberry muffin batter into the prepared muffin tray, filling the holes 3/4 of the way up.
[29 - 30] {image caption}{Scoop batter into muffin tray}
[31 - 32] Bake them on the center rack for 30 to 35 minutes or until the muffins test clean when poked in the center.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Bake muffins in preheated oven.}
[35 - 36] Allow the muffins to cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve them warm with butter and honey.
[37 - 38] {image caption}{Allow muffins to cool before eating.}
[39 - 40] Tip
[40 - 41] To make these muffins gluten-free, you can replace the regular all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour. For a dairy-free recipe, replace the buttermilk with unsweetened almond milk. If you are avoiding refined sugar, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar. You also can use coconut oil or grapeseed oil instead of canola oil.
[42 - 43] Note that bake times may differ for those who live at high elevation.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Going to the grocery store has turned into an epic quest to find the perfect bananas. In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.
[2 - 3] But no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.
[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.
[6 - 7] Since this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...
[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients
[9 - 10] For the Bread:
[10 - 11] 3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed
[11 - 12] 2 Cups all-purpose Flour
[12 - 13] 3/4 Cup White Sugar
[13 - 14] 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar
[14 - 15] 1 Stick Butter, Softened
[15 - 16] 2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten
[16 - 17] 1 tsp Vanilla
[17 - 18] 1 tsp Baking Soda
[18 - 19] 1/2 tsp Salt
[20 - 21] For the Topping:
[21 - 22] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
[22 - 23] 1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
[23 - 24] 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
[25 - 26] Optional:
[26 - 27] 1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped
[28 - 29] Oven Temp:
[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas
[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...
[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.
[36 - 37] Keep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.
[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start
[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.
[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up
[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.
[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend
[45 - 46] Finally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable.
[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It...
[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.
[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It
[51 - 52] In case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched.
[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that...    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Property types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Find short declarative claims about an ingredient (pattern 'X is/are Y').
- If it concerns mouthfeel or firmness, label as Texture.
- If it concerns taste or sweetness, label as Flavor.
- If it concerns color or maturity state (green/ripe/overripe), label as Ripeness.
- If multiple attributes are present, pick the primary attribute emphasized.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[1 - 2] There are so many things to love about this one-bowl oatmeal protein muffin recipe: It's low in sugar, flexible with substitutions and includes three simple sources of protein (nut butter, chia seeds, and flaxseed). But best of all... these muffins are seriously delicious.
[3 - 4] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with chocolate chips and banana chips}
[5 - 6] Things You'll Need
[6 - 7] 3 very ripe bananas (or 1 cup of applesauce)
[7 - 8] 1 cup milk (dairy, coconut, or almond)
[8 - 9] 1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)
[9 - 10] 2 eggs
[10 - 11] 1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey)
[11 - 12] 1 teaspoon vanilla
[12 - 13] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[13 - 14] 1/4 cup flaxseed (ground)
[14 - 15] 1 tablespoon chia seeds
[15 - 16] 3 cups whole oats
[16 - 17] Optional toppings: chocolate chips, dried banana chips
[18 - 19] Tip
[19 - 20] The peanut butter-banana base can be adapted to suit many different tastes. Applesauce works in place of bananas and any nut butter can pinch hit for the peanut butter.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Ingredients for oatmeal protein muffins}
[23 - 24] Get Started
[24 - 25] Set your oven to 375 degrees F and grease the muffin pan. Use coconut oil, spray or butter to grease your pan. Next, mash your bananas in a large mixing bowl.
[26 - 27] {image caption}{When it comes to baking with bananas, the browner the better. They'll have more flavor.}
[28 - 29] {image caption}{A potato masher works best but a fork would also do for very ripe bananas.}
[30 - 31] Add the Remaining Ingredients
[31 - 32] There's no way to mess this up. Simply combine all the ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Use regular milk, almond milk or coconut milk.}
[35 - 36] {image caption}{No need to beat the eggs ahead of time, just crack and mix.}
[37 - 38] {image caption}{We used maple syrup here but honey is also delicious.}
[39 - 40] {image caption}{Make this recipe gluten-free with specially marked containers of whole oats.}
[41 - 42] {image caption}{Without flour in the recipe, there's no worry of over-mixing.}
[43 - 44] Prepare to Bake
[44 - 45] Fill muffin cups to the top. A 3-ounce ice cream scoop works perfectly for evenly distributing muffin batter into pans. This is the time to add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips.
[46 - 47] {image caption}{Tip: Place a couple of chocolate or banana chips in the bottom of each cup before ladling in the batter.}
[48 - 49] {image caption}{Try using coconut oil spray to grease the pan. It's delicious!}
[50 - 51] Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Then cool on a rack.
[52 - 53] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with banana chips on top}
[54 - 55] Store refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. Or freeze in a single layer, inside a zip-top freezer bag.
[56 - 57] {image caption}{Mix and match your toppings, or add more.}

[0 - 1] Homemade muffins are a special addition to breakfast or brunch. Enjoy them with friends and family, or make them as a grab-and-go breakfast for busy work weeks. Warmly spiced with cinnamon, Morning Glory muffins are made with grated carrot, apple, raisins, walnuts, shredded coconut, and sometimes pineapple. While the list of ingredients is long, the process for baking these muffins is simple and well worth the required steps.
[2 - 3] ​​This recipe makes 12 muffins. ​
[4 - 5] Things You'll Need
[5 - 6] 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
[6 - 7] 1 cup shredded coconut
[7 - 8] 3/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed
[8 - 9] 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
[9 - 10] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[10 - 11] 1 teaspoon baking powder
[11 - 12] 1 cup grated carrot (about 1 large carrot, peeled and grated)
[12 - 13] 1 cup grated apple (about 1/2 large apple such as Honeycrisp)
[13 - 14] 1/2 cup raisins
[14 - 15] 1/2 cup raw walnuts, chopped
[15 - 16] 2 large eggs
[16 - 17] 1/4 cup olive oil or canola oil
[17 - 18] 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
[18 - 19] Box grater
[19 - 20] 2 mixing bowls
[20 - 21] Spoon or fork for mixing
[21 - 22] 12 disposable baking cups
[22 - 23] 12-hole muffin tray
[23 - 24] Tip
[24 - 25] To save time, use a food processor to shred the carrot and apple.
[25 - 26] Not a fan of gluten? Replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour.
[26 - 27] For naturally sweetened, refined sugar-free muffins, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.
[27 - 28] You can choose to use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut.
[28 - 29] Instructions:
[29 - 30] Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate 1 cup-worth of carrot, and 1 cup-worth of apple.
[31 - 32] Add the flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to a mixing and stir together.
[33 - 34] Add the grated carrot, apple, raisins, and walnuts to the flour mixture and stir to combine.
[35 - 36] In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, and vanilla extract.
[37 - 38] Add the egg mixture to the bowl with the flour mixture and stir well until a thick batter forms.
[39 - 40] Line a 12-hole muffin pan with baking cups. Scoop batter into the pan using an ice cream scoop or small measuring cup, filling the holes 2/3 of the way up.
[41 - 42] Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until muffins test clean when poked with a toothpick.
[43 - 44] Allow muffins to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] These are my blueberry muffins.
[4 - 5] Mmm, my favorite muffin.
[5 - 12] To a large mixing bowl, add grated lemon zest, a milk of choice, we're using soy milk, sugar, a neutral vegetable oil, and vanilla extract.
[12 - 14] Whisk well until the ingredients are well combined.
[14 - 18] Now, sift in the flour with baking powder and a pinch of salt.
[18 - 20] This is gonna make your muffin soft and fluffy.
[20 - 24] Whisk wet and dry ingredients for a short minute until lumps are gone, but without overmixing.
[24 - 29] Rinse the blueberries, shake the water off, then add them to a bowl, toss them with the cornstarch, and add them to the batter.
[29 - 31] Stir and fold the blueberries in the mixture gently.
[31 - 33] Transfer the batter to the muffin liners.
[33 - 35] You should be able to make 12 muffins.
[35 - 37] You can fill them almost to the top.
[37 - 39] Then you can sprinkle some sugar on top, or not.
[39 - 40] We're not gonna do it because we eat them for breakfast.
[41 - 46] Then bake in a preheated oven for 22 and a half minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
[46 - 48] Now let them cool down for about 30 minutes.
[48 - 49] Easy, right?    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Property types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Find short declarative claims about an ingredient (pattern 'X is/are Y').
- If it concerns mouthfeel or firmness, label as Texture.
- If it concerns taste or sweetness, label as Flavor.
- If it concerns color or maturity state (green/ripe/overripe), label as Ripeness.
- If multiple attributes are present, pick the primary attribute emphasized.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Property types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Find short declarative claims about an ingredient (pattern 'X is/are Y').
- If it concerns mouthfeel or firmness, label as Texture.
- If it concerns taste or sweetness, label as Flavor.
- If it concerns color or maturity state (green/ripe/overripe), label as Ripeness.
- If multiple attributes are present, pick the primary attribute emphasized.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!

[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Property types (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Find short declarative claims about an ingredient (pattern 'X is/are Y').
- If it concerns mouthfeel or firmness, label as Texture.
- If it concerns taste or sweetness, label as Flavor.
- If it concerns color or maturity state (green/ripe/overripe), label as Ripeness.
- If multiple attributes are present, pick the primary attribute emphasized.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] Classic blueberry muffins are nearly impossible to beat. Sweet, fluffy and studded with tangy blueberries, these muffins are always a favorite for breakfast, brunch or a snack. This easy blueberry muffin recipe is a keeper for anytime you're in need of a comforting treat. With plenty of room for adaptation, you can make these muffins gluten-free, refined sugar-free or dairy-free.
[2 - 3] Things You'll Need
[3 - 4] 3 cups all-purpose flour
[4 - 5] 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
[5 - 6] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[6 - 7] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[7 - 8] 2 eggs, lightly beaten
[8 - 9] 1 cup buttermilk
[9 - 10] 1/2 cup canola oil
[10 - 11] 1 2/3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
[12 - 13] Preparation
[13 - 14] Heat the oven to 375 F. Coat a muffin tray with nonstick spray, or line your muffin tray with baking cups. Mix the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk and canola oil.
[14 - 15] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls}
[15 - 16] Stir together the dry ingredients until well combined. Similarly, whisk together the wet ingredients until combined.
[17 - 18] {image caption}{Stir together the ingredients}
[19 - 20] Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Combine wet and dry ingredients.}
[23 - 24] Add the blueberries, and gently fold them into the batter using a rubber spatula until just combined.
[25 - 26] {image caption}{Fold blueberries into muffin batter}
[27 - 28] Scoop blueberry muffin batter into the prepared muffin tray, filling the holes 3/4 of the way up.
[29 - 30] {image caption}{Scoop batter into muffin tray}
[31 - 32] Bake them on the center rack for 30 to 35 minutes or until the muffins test clean when poked in the center.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Bake muffins in preheated oven.}
[35 - 36] Allow the muffins to cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve them warm with butter and honey.
[37 - 38] {image caption}{Allow muffins to cool before eating.}
[39 - 40] Tip
[40 - 41] To make these muffins gluten-free, you can replace the regular all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour. For a dairy-free recipe, replace the buttermilk with unsweetened almond milk. If you are avoiding refined sugar, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar. You also can use coconut oil or grapeseed oil instead of canola oil.
[42 - 43] Note that bake times may differ for those who live at high elevation.    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Informational roles (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains why something is preferred or gives a reason (descriptive, explanatory language), label as Justification.
- If it frames the statement as a factor to consider when deciding what to buy or do (imperative or decision-making language), label as Decision factor.
- Use surrounding context: if sentence is in a buying/choosing section, prefer Decision factor; if in a narrative/explanatory aside, prefer Justification.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Going to the grocery store has turned into an epic quest to find the perfect bananas. In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.
[2 - 3] But no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.
[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.
[6 - 7] Since this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...
[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients
[9 - 10] For the Bread:
[10 - 11] 3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed
[11 - 12] 2 Cups all-purpose Flour
[12 - 13] 3/4 Cup White Sugar
[13 - 14] 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar
[14 - 15] 1 Stick Butter, Softened
[15 - 16] 2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten
[16 - 17] 1 tsp Vanilla
[17 - 18] 1 tsp Baking Soda
[18 - 19] 1/2 tsp Salt
[20 - 21] For the Topping:
[21 - 22] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
[22 - 23] 1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
[23 - 24] 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
[25 - 26] Optional:
[26 - 27] 1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped
[28 - 29] Oven Temp:
[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas
[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...
[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.
[36 - 37] Keep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.
[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start
[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.
[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up
[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.
[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend
[45 - 46] Finally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable.
[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It...
[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.
[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It
[51 - 52] In case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched.
[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that...

[1 - 2] There are so many things to love about this one-bowl oatmeal protein muffin recipe: It's low in sugar, flexible with substitutions and includes three simple sources of protein (nut butter, chia seeds, and flaxseed). But best of all... these muffins are seriously delicious.
[3 - 4] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with chocolate chips and banana chips}
[5 - 6] Things You'll Need
[6 - 7] 3 very ripe bananas (or 1 cup of applesauce)
[7 - 8] 1 cup milk (dairy, coconut, or almond)
[8 - 9] 1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)
[9 - 10] 2 eggs
[10 - 11] 1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey)
[11 - 12] 1 teaspoon vanilla
[12 - 13] 1 tablespoon baking powder
[13 - 14] 1/4 cup flaxseed (ground)
[14 - 15] 1 tablespoon chia seeds
[15 - 16] 3 cups whole oats
[16 - 17] Optional toppings: chocolate chips, dried banana chips
[18 - 19] Tip
[19 - 20] The peanut butter-banana base can be adapted to suit many different tastes. Applesauce works in place of bananas and any nut butter can pinch hit for the peanut butter.
[21 - 22] {image caption}{Ingredients for oatmeal protein muffins}
[23 - 24] Get Started
[24 - 25] Set your oven to 375 degrees F and grease the muffin pan. Use coconut oil, spray or butter to grease your pan. Next, mash your bananas in a large mixing bowl.
[26 - 27] {image caption}{When it comes to baking with bananas, the browner the better. They'll have more flavor.}
[28 - 29] {image caption}{A potato masher works best but a fork would also do for very ripe bananas.}
[30 - 31] Add the Remaining Ingredients
[31 - 32] There's no way to mess this up. Simply combine all the ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
[33 - 34] {image caption}{Use regular milk, almond milk or coconut milk.}
[35 - 36] {image caption}{No need to beat the eggs ahead of time, just crack and mix.}
[37 - 38] {image caption}{We used maple syrup here but honey is also delicious.}
[39 - 40] {image caption}{Make this recipe gluten-free with specially marked containers of whole oats.}
[41 - 42] {image caption}{Without flour in the recipe, there's no worry of over-mixing.}
[43 - 44] Prepare to Bake
[44 - 45] Fill muffin cups to the top. A 3-ounce ice cream scoop works perfectly for evenly distributing muffin batter into pans. This is the time to add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips.
[46 - 47] {image caption}{Tip: Place a couple of chocolate or banana chips in the bottom of each cup before ladling in the batter.}
[48 - 49] {image caption}{Try using coconut oil spray to grease the pan. It's delicious!}
[50 - 51] Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Then cool on a rack.
[52 - 53] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with banana chips on top}
[54 - 55] Store refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. Or freeze in a single layer, inside a zip-top freezer bag.
[56 - 57] {image caption}{Mix and match your toppings, or add more.}

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 1] Homemade muffins are a special addition to breakfast or brunch. Enjoy them with friends and family, or make them as a grab-and-go breakfast for busy work weeks. Warmly spiced with cinnamon, Morning Glory muffins are made with grated carrot, apple, raisins, walnuts, shredded coconut, and sometimes pineapple. While the list of ingredients is long, the process for baking these muffins is simple and well worth the required steps.
[2 - 3] ​​This recipe makes 12 muffins. ​
[4 - 5] Things You'll Need
[5 - 6] 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
[6 - 7] 1 cup shredded coconut
[7 - 8] 3/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed
[8 - 9] 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
[9 - 10] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
[10 - 11] 1 teaspoon baking powder
[11 - 12] 1 cup grated carrot (about 1 large carrot, peeled and grated)
[12 - 13] 1 cup grated apple (about 1/2 large apple such as Honeycrisp)
[13 - 14] 1/2 cup raisins
[14 - 15] 1/2 cup raw walnuts, chopped
[15 - 16] 2 large eggs
[16 - 17] 1/4 cup olive oil or canola oil
[17 - 18] 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
[18 - 19] Box grater
[19 - 20] 2 mixing bowls
[20 - 21] Spoon or fork for mixing
[21 - 22] 12 disposable baking cups
[22 - 23] 12-hole muffin tray
[23 - 24] Tip
[24 - 25] To save time, use a food processor to shred the carrot and apple.
[25 - 26] Not a fan of gluten? Replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour.
[26 - 27] For naturally sweetened, refined sugar-free muffins, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.
[27 - 28] You can choose to use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut.
[28 - 29] Instructions:
[29 - 30] Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate 1 cup-worth of carrot, and 1 cup-worth of apple.
[31 - 32] Add the flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to a mixing and stir together.
[33 - 34] Add the grated carrot, apple, raisins, and walnuts to the flour mixture and stir to combine.
[35 - 36] In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, and vanilla extract.
[37 - 38] Add the egg mixture to the bowl with the flour mixture and stir well until a thick batter forms.
[39 - 40] Line a 12-hole muffin pan with baking cups. Scoop batter into the pan using an ice cream scoop or small measuring cup, filling the holes 2/3 of the way up.
[41 - 42] Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until muffins test clean when poked with a toothpick.
[43 - 44] Allow muffins to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Informational roles (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains why something is preferred or gives a reason (descriptive, explanatory language), label as Justification.
- If it frames the statement as a factor to consider when deciding what to buy or do (imperative or decision-making language), label as Decision factor.
- Use surrounding context: if sentence is in a buying/choosing section, prefer Decision factor; if in a narrative/explanatory aside, prefer Justification.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 1] These are my blueberry muffins.
[4 - 5] Mmm, my favorite muffin.
[5 - 12] To a large mixing bowl, add grated lemon zest, a milk of choice, we're using soy milk, sugar, a neutral vegetable oil, and vanilla extract.
[12 - 14] Whisk well until the ingredients are well combined.
[14 - 18] Now, sift in the flour with baking powder and a pinch of salt.
[18 - 20] This is gonna make your muffin soft and fluffy.
[20 - 24] Whisk wet and dry ingredients for a short minute until lumps are gone, but without overmixing.
[24 - 29] Rinse the blueberries, shake the water off, then add them to a bowl, toss them with the cornstarch, and add them to the batter.
[29 - 31] Stir and fold the blueberries in the mixture gently.
[31 - 33] Transfer the batter to the muffin liners.
[33 - 35] You should be able to make 12 muffins.
[35 - 37] You can fill them almost to the top.
[37 - 39] Then you can sprinkle some sugar on top, or not.
[39 - 40] We're not gonna do it because we eat them for breakfast.
[41 - 46] Then bake in a preheated oven for 22 and a half minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
[46 - 48] Now let them cool down for about 30 minutes.
[48 - 49] Easy, right?

[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Informational roles (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains why something is preferred or gives a reason (descriptive, explanatory language), label as Justification.
- If it frames the statement as a factor to consider when deciding what to buy or do (imperative or decision-making language), label as Decision factor.
- Use surrounding context: if sentence is in a buying/choosing section, prefer Decision factor; if in a narrative/explanatory aside, prefer Justification.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Informational roles (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the sentence explains why something is preferred or gives a reason (descriptive, explanatory language), label as Justification.
- If it frames the statement as a factor to consider when deciding what to buy or do (imperative or decision-making language), label as Decision factor.
- Use surrounding context: if sentence is in a buying/choosing section, prefer Decision factor; if in a narrative/explanatory aside, prefer Justification.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Going to the grocery store has become a difficult quest to find the perfect bananas.
[2] The Clothier household prefers bananas that are still a bit green.
[3] Greener bananas are firmer.
[4] Greener bananas have a better flavor.
[5] Decide how many bananas to buy based on how many will be eaten in the next few days.
[6] Consider whether one banana per day per person is appropriate when deciding how many to buy.
[7] Consider whether bananas will be used in cereal or other dishes when deciding how many to buy.
[8] The ripeness (how green the bananas are) is the most important factor in deciding whether to buy them.
[9] Sometimes buy some bananas that will be perfect in a couple of days and some that are perfect right now.
[10] Sometimes one or two bananas go uneaten or ripen faster than expected.
[11] Banana bread (and similar banana baked goods) was likely created to use bananas that are blackening before they go to waste.
[12] The muffins have a crumbly coating on top.
[13] The crumbly topping adds texture and flavor to the muffins.
[14] The added texture and flavor from the crumble is worth the extra calories.
[15] The presenter does not make these muffins often.
[16] The presenter does not worry much about how unhealthy the muffins might be.
[17] If concerned about calories, using the gym is an option.
[18] Step 1 is the list of ingredients.
[19] Ingredients for the bread are listed separately from the topping and optional items.
[20] Use 3 to 4 bananas, mashed, for the bread.
[21] Use 2 cups of all-purpose flour for the bread.
[22] Use 3/4 cup white sugar for the bread.
[23] Use 1/4 cup brown sugar for the bread.
[24] Use 1 stick of butter, softened, for the bread.
[25] Use 2 eggs, slightly beaten, for the bread.
[26] Use 1 teaspoon of vanilla for the bread.
[27] Use 1 teaspoon of baking soda for the bread.
[28] Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the bread.
[29] For the topping use 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
[30] For the topping use 1/3 cup brown sugar.
[31] For the topping use 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.
[32] Optional: use 1 cup of chopped walnuts.
[33] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit once all ingredients are gathered.
[34] Step 2 is to prepare the bananas.
[35] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl.
[36] Bananas with a few spots are acceptable for this recipe.
[37] Cut away any very black parts of bananas if those parts are unappealing.
[38] Peel off any clingy banana strings.
[39] Using a sturdy utensil, thoroughly smash the bananas until mostly liquified.
[40] Be careful when smashing bananas because a utensil could break from excessive force.
[41] Smashing bananas can serve as a stress reliever or an arm workout.
[42] Stop smashing when the bananas are mostly liquified but still have a few bits for texture.
[43] Step 3 is a sweet start where butter and sugars are combined.
[44] Ensure the butter is softened but not melted before combining with sugar.
[45] Combine the softened butter with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
[46] Use a fork or a strong whisk to blend the butter and sugars.
[47] Mix the butter and sugars until the mixture is well blended and creamy.
[48] Step 4 is to mix the wet ingredients with the mashed bananas.
[49] Beat the eggs and add them to the vanilla and the butter/sugar mixture.
[50] Combine the beaten eggs, vanilla, and butter/sugar mixture into the mashed bananas.
[51] If adding walnuts, add them when combining the wet ingredients into the bananas.
[52] Step 5 is to add dry ingredients and finish the batter.
[53] Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the banana/egg mixture.
[54] Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt into the batter until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated.
[55] Pour the finished batter into the chosen cooking pan.
[56] This recipe can be made as muffins, a loaf, or a cake.
[57] Step 6 is to prepare the topping.
[58] Blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until the mixture becomes very crumbly.
[59] Sprinkle the crumbly topping over the batter.
[60] It is acceptable to make extra topping and apply it thickly.
[61] Typically, butter is used to make a streusel topping.
[62] The recipe uses oil for the topping because there is already a stick of butter in the batter and the presenter is trying to reduce butter intake.
[63] If preferred, replace the oil with 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.
[64] Step 7 is to bake the muffins or chosen pan of batter.
[65] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit if not already preheated.
[66] Bake the batter for a time appropriate to the chosen pan.
[67] Bake muffins for 18 to 20 minutes.
[68] Test muffins with a clean knife or toothpick to ensure they are done.
[69] Let the baked goods cool on a rack for 15 minutes or until they can be safely touched.
[70] After cooling for 15 minutes, proceed with serving or storing the muffins as desired.
[71] The presenter implies the remaining steps (serving and eating) are straightforward.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Ingredient types (i.e., Group each ingredient line by the head-noun's broad ingredient category (e.g., flour → Flour; rolled oats → Oats/Grain; butter → Fat). Assign one category per ingredient line, ignoring modifiers for category assignment but keeping them for detail.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Flour
Definition: Ground-wheat or baking flours used as the dry base (e.g., all-purpose flour).

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a sky-high bakery top and a crisp edge?
[2] I'm going to show you how to make moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a bakery-style top and crisp edge.
[3] This is Preppy Kitchen and John Kanell teaches how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with family and friends.
[4] These chocolate chip muffins whip up quickly.
[5] Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[6] A high blast of heat when the muffins go in sets the edge and lets the muffins rise up to form a bakery-style dome.
[7] Baking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit causes the muffins to spread out and not form the desired bakery-style muffin.
[8] Prepare the dry ingredients.
[9] Use a scale for the most accurate results when measuring ingredients.
[10] If you are using cups instead of a scale, watch the 'how to measure flour' video for proper measuring technique.
[11] The 'how to measure flour' video shows all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[12] Measuring flour incorrectly is the thing that goes wrong most often in baking.
[13] Adding too much flour to a recipe negatively affects baking results.
[14] Place a sifter and a bowl on the work surface for dry ingredients.
[15] Add 2 and 3/14 cups (330 grams) of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
[16] Add one teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.
[17] Use one teaspoon of salt to provide contrast to the chocolate and sugar and to amp the flavor.
[18] Add one tablespoon of baking powder for leavening.
[19] Using a relatively large amount of baking powder helps produce a bakery-style top.
[20] Sift the dry ingredients.
[21] Set the scale aside after measuring.
[22] Give the sifted dry ingredients a quick whisk.
[23] Set the whisked dry ingredients aside.
[24] Melted butter was prepared a minute earlier.
[25] The melted butter has cooled down.
[26] Warm the cooled butter in the microwave if needed.
[27] Keep wet ingredients at room temperature for best results.
[28] If wet ingredients get cold, warm them in the microwave.
[29] The counter is very cold and will cool ingredients down.
[30] Measure 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of whole milk.
[31] Add the measured whole milk to the wet ingredients bowl.
[32] Add half a cup (113 grams) of unsalted butter that has been melted.
[33] Scrape all melted butter into the wet ingredients bowl.
[34] Introduce Brian as a first-time filmer for Preppy Kitchen today.
[35] Brian is present behind the camera and is eating cookies made by the host.
[36] Add one cup (200 grams) of sugar to the wet ingredients bowl.
[37] Give the wet ingredients a little whisk to combine them.
[38] If clumps of butter appear when mixing wet ingredients, microwave the mixture for 40 seconds to fix it.
[39] Using warm milk helps prevent butter clumps when mixing wet ingredients.
[40] Add two large eggs to the wet ingredient bowl.
[41] Add 1 1/4 cups of sour cream to the wet ingredient bowl.
[42] If sour cream is unavailable, use full-fat plain yogurt instead.
[43] Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract (optional).
[44] Whisk the wet ingredients together.
[45] The wet mixture can turn into a butter mush if the ingredients are not properly combined.
[46] If the wet mixture becomes a butter mush, apply a little heat in the microwave after whisking the eggs in.
[47] Do not microwave the wet mixture before whisking the eggs because the eggs could be overcooked.
[48] A small amount of heat will remedy issues with the wet mixture consistency.
[49] Warm the wet mixture briefly and then whisk it again.
[50] Aim for a nice, homogenous, fluid wet mixture.
[51] Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
[52] Whisk the combined wet and dry ingredients to almost combined.
[53] Having a few clumps of flour in the batter is acceptable because further mixing will occur after adding chocolate chips.
[54] It is fine to have a couple clumps of flour in the batter at this stage.
[55] Prepare chocolate for the batter.
[56] The recipe specifies 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
[57] The instructor is using one cup semisweet and half a cup bittersweet chocolate for a richer mix.
[58] You can use milk chocolate if you prefer.
[59] Reserve a handful of semisweet chocolate chips to sprinkle on top of the muffins for appearance.
[60] Add the rest of the chocolate chips to the batter.
[61] Fold the chocolate chips into the batter with a spatula rather than using a whisk.
[62] After folding in the chocolate chips, transfer the batter into the muffin tins.
[63] Demonstrate two methods of baking: naked muffins (no paper liners) and muffins in paper liners.
[64] Expect differences in appearance between muffins baked naked and muffins baked in paper liners.
[65] Butter and flour half of the muffin tins as a release method.
[66] Coat butter across the muffin cavity, add a good dash of flour, move the flour around, and dump out the excess flour.
[67] Use paper muffin liners for the rest of the tin cavities to produce taller muffins but with less crisp edge.
[68] Paper liners go a bit higher and prevent the mushroom-shaped muffin top while still allowing a nice dome.
[69] Transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[70] If you prefer a nice crispy muffin edge, bake without paper liners.
[71] When baking without paper liners, be careful to add enough butter and flour so muffins pop out easily.
[72] Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[73] Fill the muffin cavities all the way to the top for big bakery-style muffins.
[74] Normally cupcake batter fills two-thirds of the way, but for these muffins the cups should be filled full.
[75] When filling paper liners, avoid getting batter on the edges to prevent burning.
[76] Batter on the edges will burn and mainly affects appearance rather than bake quality.
[77] Monitor chocolate chip distribution while scooping the batter to ensure even chip distribution.
[78] If a scoop lacks chocolate chips, add some chips to that scoop to balance distribution.
[79] After filling muffin cavities, top the muffins with a scattering of reserved chocolate chips.
[80] Adding chocolate chips on top gives glossy, melty chocolate tops and significantly improves appearance.
[81] Chocolate chip muffins look naked without chocolate chips on top.
[82] This recipe yields exactly 12 large muffins.
[83] High initial oven heat locks in the muffin edge so the top can burst through and form a bakery-style dome.
[84] Bake the muffins at 425°F for five minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
[85] Bake until the top is nicely golden and the center is set.
[86] Insert a skewer into the center of a muffin to check doneness; it should come out clean except for molten chocolate.
[87] Place the muffin tin into the oven.
[88] Remove the muffins from the oven and cool them just enough to touch before handling.
[89] Muffins baked without paper liners have a crisp edge, a little muffin overhang, and a golden brown color.
[90] Muffins baked in paper liners are guided upward by the paper, are a bit taller, and lack the crisp edge.
[91] Muffins baked in paper liners feel soft all over.
[92] Inspect the inside of a muffin to evaluate crumb and chocolate distribution.
[93] If you like the video, check out the host's chocolate playlist.
[94] There is someone making funny faces behind the camera.
[95] The chocolate playlist contains the host's favorite chocolate recipes which are very delicious.
[96] Now taste a muffin.
[97] The muffin tastes exceptionally good and perfect.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com.
[2] Today I'll be showing you how to make fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[3] The muffins are loaded with a ton of blueberries.
[4] The muffins are topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[5] Start by combining all dry ingredients.
[6] In a large bowl, combine two cups of all-purpose flour.
[7] In a large bowl, add one teaspoon of baking powder.
[8] In a large bowl, add half a teaspoon of baking soda.
[9] In a large bowl, add a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[10] Whisk the dry ingredients together.
[11] Reserve one tablespoon of the flour mixture.
[12] Mix the reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[13] The reason for adding a small amount of flour to the blueberries is related to when the blueberries are added to the batter.
[14] Coating blueberries in flour prevents the blueberries from sinking as fast during baking.
[15] Add three eggs into a large bowl.
[16] Whisk the three eggs on high speed using an electric mixer.
[17] Whisk the eggs for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[18] Continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[19] Keep beating the eggs for about three more minutes after adding the sugar.
[20] Well-beaten eggs are the key to really fluffy muffins.
[21] Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[22] Add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[23] Continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarters of a cup of heavy cream.
[24] Begin adding the dry ingredients to the wet mixture rather than adding all at once.
[25] Do not add all of the dry ingredients to the batter at once.
[26] Get a sifter.
[27] Add about a third of the flour mixture at a time to the batter.
[28] Mix between each addition of the flour mixture.
[29] Once all of the dry ingredients are well combined into the muffin batter, the batter is ready for the next step.
[30] Continue beating the batter with an electric mixer while preparing to add butter.
[31] Slowly and gradually add four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter to the batter.
[32] The last step before portioning is adding the blueberries.
[33] Fold the blueberries into the batter with a spatula.
[34] Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
[35] Begin scooping the batter into the lined muffin tin using a large cookie scoop.
[36] Top each muffin with a few extra blueberries if desired.
[37] Topping muffins with extra blueberries is optional.
[38] Before baking, make a simple streusel topping.
[39] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[40] Mash the streusel ingredients together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined.
[41] Mash the streusel ingredients until they have a crumbly texture.
[42] Top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping.
[43] Bake the topped muffins in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[44] I hope you enjoyed watching this video; please share, like, and subscribe to the channel.

[29] Use a total of 2 cups of all-purpose flour in the recipe.
[30] Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour at this stage.
[31] Use the rubber spatula to stir the flour in.
[32] Once white specks of flour start to disappear, pour in 1/2 cup of milk or buttermilk.
[33] Buttermilk gives a poofier muffin.
[34] Stir the milk or buttermilk into the batter until well combined.
[35] Add the remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour.
[36] Stir the batter together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything gets mixed in.
[37] Add dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries into the batter after it is mixed if desired.
[38] The batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[39] Divide the batter among the 12 muffin cups.
[40] Fill each muffin cup about two-thirds of the way full.
[41] Try to divide the batter as evenly as possible because the recipe makes 12 muffins.
[42] Let muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before baking if desired.
[43] If making a larger batch, it is okay to let the batter rest between baking different batches.
[44] Bake muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[45] After 7 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[46] Continue baking for 12–15 minutes and watch muffins carefully because cooking time varies by oven.
[47] Start variations with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[48] A lemon blueberry muffin demonstrates using another flavor of extract and adding fresh fruit.
[49] After creaming sugar and butter and adding eggs, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before baking powder and salt for the lemon blueberry variation.
[50] Continue with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk for the lemon blueberry variation.
[51] After finishing the batter for lemon blueberry muffins, add 1 cup of fresh blueberries.
[52] You can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh blueberries.
[53] Optionally add the zest of 1 lemon, about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[54] Fold lemon zest and blueberries into the batter.
[55] Divide the lemon blueberry batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups.
[56] Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of muffins as a topping option.
[57] Sprinkling granulated sugar on top gives muffins a crunchy sweet top.
[58] Bake lemon blueberry muffins using the same baking procedure as the base recipe.
[59] Make a chocolate muffin version next.
[60] For a chocolate version, use butter and sugar as before and add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.
[61] Cream unsweetened cocoa powder in with the butter and sugar.
[62] Proceed with the master muffin recipe by adding eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk for the chocolate variation.
[63] Adding cocoa powder does not significantly change the texture of the final batter.
[64] Add 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold them into the chocolate batter.
[65] When mixing add-ins, keep the total amount of additions (chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit) to 1 cup total.
[66] Demonstrate a muffin hack using instant pudding to switch up flavors quickly.
[67] For the pudding variation, use only 3/4 cup of granulated sugar.
[68] Replace the missing 1/4 cup of sugar with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix.
[69] Use pistachio instant pudding mix as one flavor option.
[70] Cream the pudding mix and adjusted sugar together with the butter as directed and proceed with the master muffin recipe.
[71] You can fold in chopped pistachios into the pudding-flavored batter if desired.
[72] Instant pudding variation is fun because many flavors of instant pudding make it easy to mix and match flavors quickly without buying many extracts.
[73] Show how easy it is to mix and match add-ins to add flavor without much hassle.
[74] Demonstrate a cranberry white chocolate chip muffin with a little bit of orange zest.
[75] Use the master recipe with no alterations as the base for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[76] Add 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[77] Add 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips so the total add-ins equal 1 cup.
[78] If no orange extract is available, add 1/2 tablespoon of orange zest total to add a hint of orange flavor.
[79] Fold in add-ins until ingredients are evenly distributed.
[80] You can use chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts as add-in options because possibilities are endless.
[81] Show how to add spices to the muffin base.
[82] Demonstrate a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in topped with a brown sugar streusel.
[83] Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract before adding cinnamon for the cinnamon variation.
[84] Add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[85] You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[86] Adjust the amount of cinnamon depending on how pronounced you want the cinnamon flavor.
[87] Finish the cinnamon muffin batter with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk.
[88] Fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips.
[89] Cinnamon chips can be harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[90] Divide the batter into prepared muffin cups before making the streusel topping.
[91] A streusel is easy to make and is a decadent addition to many muffin flavors.
[92] Start streusel with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
[93] Add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the streusel.
[94] Add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour to the streusel.
[95] Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the streusel.
[96] Use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the streusel ingredients together.
[97] Cut streusel together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[98] Sprinkle the streusel generously on top of muffin batter.
[99] The streusel looks like little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[100] The baking time for muffins with streusel and other variations is the same as the base recipe.
[101] You can make almost any muffin flavor using one master recipe.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Stages (i.e., Label each instructional sentence by whether it is a preparatory/setup decision or an execution-time instruction/warning tied to the action of baking or immediately before baking.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Setup choices or actions to perform before filling pans or starting the bake (selecting ingredients/tools, combining/mixing batter prior to baking, treating add-ins so they behave in the bake, chilling batter before baking, transferring batter to liners).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
	- Context 1: First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe. So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
	- Content 2: Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
	- Context 2: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
```
[S2] Execution
Definition: Step-specific instructions and cautions during baking or at the point of placing/removing from the oven (oven times/temperatures, baking actions, filling pans, cooling/removal, and immediate post-bake handling).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Going to the grocery store has become a difficult quest to find the perfect bananas.
[2] The Clothier household prefers bananas that are still a bit green.
[3] Greener bananas are firmer.
[4] Greener bananas have a better flavor.
[5] Decide how many bananas to buy based on how many will be eaten in the next few days.
[6] Consider whether one banana per day per person is appropriate when deciding how many to buy.
[7] Consider whether bananas will be used in cereal or other dishes when deciding how many to buy.
[8] The ripeness (how green the bananas are) is the most important factor in deciding whether to buy them.
[9] Sometimes buy some bananas that will be perfect in a couple of days and some that are perfect right now.
[10] Sometimes one or two bananas go uneaten or ripen faster than expected.
[11] Banana bread (and similar banana baked goods) was likely created to use bananas that are blackening before they go to waste.
[12] The muffins have a crumbly coating on top.
[13] The crumbly topping adds texture and flavor to the muffins.
[14] The added texture and flavor from the crumble is worth the extra calories.
[15] The presenter does not make these muffins often.
[16] The presenter does not worry much about how unhealthy the muffins might be.
[17] If concerned about calories, using the gym is an option.
[18] Step 1 is the list of ingredients.
[19] Ingredients for the bread are listed separately from the topping and optional items.
[20] Use 3 to 4 bananas, mashed, for the bread.
[21] Use 2 cups of all-purpose flour for the bread.
[22] Use 3/4 cup white sugar for the bread.
[23] Use 1/4 cup brown sugar for the bread.
[24] Use 1 stick of butter, softened, for the bread.
[25] Use 2 eggs, slightly beaten, for the bread.
[26] Use 1 teaspoon of vanilla for the bread.
[27] Use 1 teaspoon of baking soda for the bread.
[28] Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the bread.
[29] For the topping use 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
[30] For the topping use 1/3 cup brown sugar.
[31] For the topping use 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.
[32] Optional: use 1 cup of chopped walnuts.
[33] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit once all ingredients are gathered.
[34] Step 2 is to prepare the bananas.
[35] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl.
[36] Bananas with a few spots are acceptable for this recipe.
[37] Cut away any very black parts of bananas if those parts are unappealing.
[38] Peel off any clingy banana strings.
[39] Using a sturdy utensil, thoroughly smash the bananas until mostly liquified.
[40] Be careful when smashing bananas because a utensil could break from excessive force.
[41] Smashing bananas can serve as a stress reliever or an arm workout.
[42] Stop smashing when the bananas are mostly liquified but still have a few bits for texture.
[43] Step 3 is a sweet start where butter and sugars are combined.
[44] Ensure the butter is softened but not melted before combining with sugar.
[45] Combine the softened butter with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
[46] Use a fork or a strong whisk to blend the butter and sugars.
[47] Mix the butter and sugars until the mixture is well blended and creamy.
[48] Step 4 is to mix the wet ingredients with the mashed bananas.
[49] Beat the eggs and add them to the vanilla and the butter/sugar mixture.
[50] Combine the beaten eggs, vanilla, and butter/sugar mixture into the mashed bananas.
[51] If adding walnuts, add them when combining the wet ingredients into the bananas.
[52] Step 5 is to add dry ingredients and finish the batter.
[53] Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the banana/egg mixture.
[54] Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt into the batter until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated.
[55] Pour the finished batter into the chosen cooking pan.
[56] This recipe can be made as muffins, a loaf, or a cake.
[57] Step 6 is to prepare the topping.
[58] Blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until the mixture becomes very crumbly.
[59] Sprinkle the crumbly topping over the batter.
[60] It is acceptable to make extra topping and apply it thickly.
[61] Typically, butter is used to make a streusel topping.
[62] The recipe uses oil for the topping because there is already a stick of butter in the batter and the presenter is trying to reduce butter intake.
[63] If preferred, replace the oil with 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.
[64] Step 7 is to bake the muffins or chosen pan of batter.
[65] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit if not already preheated.
[66] Bake the batter for a time appropriate to the chosen pan.
[67] Bake muffins for 18 to 20 minutes.
[68] Test muffins with a clean knife or toothpick to ensure they are done.
[69] Let the baked goods cool on a rack for 15 minutes or until they can be safely touched.
[70] After cooling for 15 minutes, proceed with serving or storing the muffins as desired.
[71] The presenter implies the remaining steps (serving and eating) are straightforward.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Stages (i.e., Label each instructional sentence by whether it is a preparatory/setup decision or an execution-time instruction/warning tied to the action of baking or immediately before baking.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Setup choices or actions to perform before filling pans or starting the bake (selecting ingredients/tools, combining/mixing batter prior to baking, treating add-ins so they behave in the bake, chilling batter before baking, transferring batter to liners).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
	- Context 1: First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe. So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
	- Content 2: Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
	- Context 2: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
```
[S2] Execution
Definition: Step-specific instructions and cautions during baking or at the point of placing/removing from the oven (oven times/temperatures, baking actions, filling pans, cooling/removal, and immediate post-bake handling).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
	- Context 1: You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches. Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
	- Content 2: After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
	- Context 2: Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
```
[S3] Intro
Definition: Non-instructional commentary, introductory remarks, or personal comments that do not convey setup or execution steps.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
	- Context 1: 0 - 4: Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a sky-high bakery top and a crisp edge?
[2] I'm going to show you how to make moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a bakery-style top and crisp edge.
[3] This is Preppy Kitchen and John Kanell teaches how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with family and friends.
[4] These chocolate chip muffins whip up quickly.
[5] Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[6] A high blast of heat when the muffins go in sets the edge and lets the muffins rise up to form a bakery-style dome.
[7] Baking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit causes the muffins to spread out and not form the desired bakery-style muffin.
[8] Prepare the dry ingredients.
[9] Use a scale for the most accurate results when measuring ingredients.
[10] If you are using cups instead of a scale, watch the 'how to measure flour' video for proper measuring technique.
[11] The 'how to measure flour' video shows all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[12] Measuring flour incorrectly is the thing that goes wrong most often in baking.
[13] Adding too much flour to a recipe negatively affects baking results.
[14] Place a sifter and a bowl on the work surface for dry ingredients.
[15] Add 2 and 3/14 cups (330 grams) of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
[16] Add one teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.
[17] Use one teaspoon of salt to provide contrast to the chocolate and sugar and to amp the flavor.
[18] Add one tablespoon of baking powder for leavening.
[19] Using a relatively large amount of baking powder helps produce a bakery-style top.
[20] Sift the dry ingredients.
[21] Set the scale aside after measuring.
[22] Give the sifted dry ingredients a quick whisk.
[23] Set the whisked dry ingredients aside.
[24] Melted butter was prepared a minute earlier.
[25] The melted butter has cooled down.
[26] Warm the cooled butter in the microwave if needed.
[27] Keep wet ingredients at room temperature for best results.
[28] If wet ingredients get cold, warm them in the microwave.
[29] The counter is very cold and will cool ingredients down.
[30] Measure 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of whole milk.
[31] Add the measured whole milk to the wet ingredients bowl.
[32] Add half a cup (113 grams) of unsalted butter that has been melted.
[33] Scrape all melted butter into the wet ingredients bowl.
[34] Introduce Brian as a first-time filmer for Preppy Kitchen today.
[35] Brian is present behind the camera and is eating cookies made by the host.
[36] Add one cup (200 grams) of sugar to the wet ingredients bowl.
[37] Give the wet ingredients a little whisk to combine them.
[38] If clumps of butter appear when mixing wet ingredients, microwave the mixture for 40 seconds to fix it.
[39] Using warm milk helps prevent butter clumps when mixing wet ingredients.
[40] Add two large eggs to the wet ingredient bowl.
[41] Add 1 1/4 cups of sour cream to the wet ingredient bowl.
[42] If sour cream is unavailable, use full-fat plain yogurt instead.
[43] Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract (optional).
[44] Whisk the wet ingredients together.
[45] The wet mixture can turn into a butter mush if the ingredients are not properly combined.
[46] If the wet mixture becomes a butter mush, apply a little heat in the microwave after whisking the eggs in.
[47] Do not microwave the wet mixture before whisking the eggs because the eggs could be overcooked.
[48] A small amount of heat will remedy issues with the wet mixture consistency.
[49] Warm the wet mixture briefly and then whisk it again.
[50] Aim for a nice, homogenous, fluid wet mixture.
[51] Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
[52] Whisk the combined wet and dry ingredients to almost combined.
[53] Having a few clumps of flour in the batter is acceptable because further mixing will occur after adding chocolate chips.
[54] It is fine to have a couple clumps of flour in the batter at this stage.
[55] Prepare chocolate for the batter.
[56] The recipe specifies 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
[57] The instructor is using one cup semisweet and half a cup bittersweet chocolate for a richer mix.
[58] You can use milk chocolate if you prefer.
[59] Reserve a handful of semisweet chocolate chips to sprinkle on top of the muffins for appearance.
[60] Add the rest of the chocolate chips to the batter.
[61] Fold the chocolate chips into the batter with a spatula rather than using a whisk.
[62] After folding in the chocolate chips, transfer the batter into the muffin tins.
[63] Demonstrate two methods of baking: naked muffins (no paper liners) and muffins in paper liners.
[64] Expect differences in appearance between muffins baked naked and muffins baked in paper liners.
[65] Butter and flour half of the muffin tins as a release method.
[66] Coat butter across the muffin cavity, add a good dash of flour, move the flour around, and dump out the excess flour.
[67] Use paper muffin liners for the rest of the tin cavities to produce taller muffins but with less crisp edge.
[68] Paper liners go a bit higher and prevent the mushroom-shaped muffin top while still allowing a nice dome.
[69] Transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[70] If you prefer a nice crispy muffin edge, bake without paper liners.
[71] When baking without paper liners, be careful to add enough butter and flour so muffins pop out easily.
[72] Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[73] Fill the muffin cavities all the way to the top for big bakery-style muffins.
[74] Normally cupcake batter fills two-thirds of the way, but for these muffins the cups should be filled full.
[75] When filling paper liners, avoid getting batter on the edges to prevent burning.
[76] Batter on the edges will burn and mainly affects appearance rather than bake quality.
[77] Monitor chocolate chip distribution while scooping the batter to ensure even chip distribution.
[78] If a scoop lacks chocolate chips, add some chips to that scoop to balance distribution.
[79] After filling muffin cavities, top the muffins with a scattering of reserved chocolate chips.
[80] Adding chocolate chips on top gives glossy, melty chocolate tops and significantly improves appearance.
[81] Chocolate chip muffins look naked without chocolate chips on top.
[82] This recipe yields exactly 12 large muffins.
[83] High initial oven heat locks in the muffin edge so the top can burst through and form a bakery-style dome.
[84] Bake the muffins at 425°F for five minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
[85] Bake until the top is nicely golden and the center is set.
[86] Insert a skewer into the center of a muffin to check doneness; it should come out clean except for molten chocolate.
[87] Place the muffin tin into the oven.
[88] Remove the muffins from the oven and cool them just enough to touch before handling.
[89] Muffins baked without paper liners have a crisp edge, a little muffin overhang, and a golden brown color.
[90] Muffins baked in paper liners are guided upward by the paper, are a bit taller, and lack the crisp edge.
[91] Muffins baked in paper liners feel soft all over.
[92] Inspect the inside of a muffin to evaluate crumb and chocolate distribution.
[93] If you like the video, check out the host's chocolate playlist.
[94] There is someone making funny faces behind the camera.
[95] The chocolate playlist contains the host's favorite chocolate recipes which are very delicious.
[96] Now taste a muffin.
[97] The muffin tastes exceptionally good and perfect.
[98] If you like the videos, hit the like button and subscribe.
[99] The host will see viewers in the next video.

[1] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com.
[2] Today I'll be showing you how to make fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[3] The muffins are loaded with a ton of blueberries.
[4] The muffins are topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[5] Start by combining all dry ingredients.
[6] In a large bowl, combine two cups of all-purpose flour.
[7] In a large bowl, add one teaspoon of baking powder.
[8] In a large bowl, add half a teaspoon of baking soda.
[9] In a large bowl, add a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[10] Whisk the dry ingredients together.
[11] Reserve one tablespoon of the flour mixture.
[12] Mix the reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[13] The reason for adding a small amount of flour to the blueberries is related to when the blueberries are added to the batter.
[14] Coating blueberries in flour prevents the blueberries from sinking as fast during baking.
[15] Add three eggs into a large bowl.
[16] Whisk the three eggs on high speed using an electric mixer.
[17] Whisk the eggs for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[18] Continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[19] Keep beating the eggs for about three more minutes after adding the sugar.
[20] Well-beaten eggs are the key to really fluffy muffins.
[21] Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[22] Add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[23] Continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarters of a cup of heavy cream.
[24] Begin adding the dry ingredients to the wet mixture rather than adding all at once.
[25] Do not add all of the dry ingredients to the batter at once.
[26] Get a sifter.
[27] Add about a third of the flour mixture at a time to the batter.
[28] Mix between each addition of the flour mixture.
[29] Once all of the dry ingredients are well combined into the muffin batter, the batter is ready for the next step.
[30] Continue beating the batter with an electric mixer while preparing to add butter.
[31] Slowly and gradually add four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter to the batter.
[32] The last step before portioning is adding the blueberries.
[33] Fold the blueberries into the batter with a spatula.
[34] Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
[35] Begin scooping the batter into the lined muffin tin using a large cookie scoop.
[36] Top each muffin with a few extra blueberries if desired.
[37] Topping muffins with extra blueberries is optional.
[38] Before baking, make a simple streusel topping.
[39] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[40] Mash the streusel ingredients together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined.
[41] Mash the streusel ingredients until they have a crumbly texture.
[42] Top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping.
[43] Bake the topped muffins in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[44] I hope you enjoyed watching this video; please share, like, and subscribe to the channel.
[45] See you next time!

[78] If no orange extract is available, add 1/2 tablespoon of orange zest total to add a hint of orange flavor.
[79] Fold in add-ins until ingredients are evenly distributed.
[80] You can use chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts as add-in options because possibilities are endless.
[81] Show how to add spices to the muffin base.

[88] Fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips.
[89] Cinnamon chips can be harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[90] Divide the batter into prepared muffin cups before making the streusel topping.
[91] A streusel is easy to make and is a decadent addition to many muffin flavors.
[92] Start streusel with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
[93] Add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the streusel.
[94] Add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour to the streusel.
[95] Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the streusel.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Purposes (i.e., Label each guidance sentence or ingredient-descriptor by the primary goal or role it serves: appearance/texture goals, release/removal aims, safety/quality concerns, or the role of an element as core, finish, or product claim.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Aesthetic
Definition: Instructions whose main goal is to achieve a particular appearance or texture (e.g., domes, crumb, surface texture, fluffiness).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Context 2: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Going to the grocery store has become a difficult quest to find the perfect bananas.
[2] The Clothier household prefers bananas that are still a bit green.
[3] Greener bananas are firmer.
[4] Greener bananas have a better flavor.
[5] Decide how many bananas to buy based on how many will be eaten in the next few days.
[6] Consider whether one banana per day per person is appropriate when deciding how many to buy.
[7] Consider whether bananas will be used in cereal or other dishes when deciding how many to buy.
[8] The ripeness (how green the bananas are) is the most important factor in deciding whether to buy them.
[9] Sometimes buy some bananas that will be perfect in a couple of days and some that are perfect right now.
[10] Sometimes one or two bananas go uneaten or ripen faster than expected.
[11] Banana bread (and similar banana baked goods) was likely created to use bananas that are blackening before they go to waste.
[12] The muffins have a crumbly coating on top.
[13] The crumbly topping adds texture and flavor to the muffins.
[14] The added texture and flavor from the crumble is worth the extra calories.
[15] The presenter does not make these muffins often.
[16] The presenter does not worry much about how unhealthy the muffins might be.
[17] If concerned about calories, using the gym is an option.
[18] Step 1 is the list of ingredients.
[19] Ingredients for the bread are listed separately from the topping and optional items.
[20] Use 3 to 4 bananas, mashed, for the bread.
[21] Use 2 cups of all-purpose flour for the bread.
[22] Use 3/4 cup white sugar for the bread.
[23] Use 1/4 cup brown sugar for the bread.
[24] Use 1 stick of butter, softened, for the bread.
[25] Use 2 eggs, slightly beaten, for the bread.
[26] Use 1 teaspoon of vanilla for the bread.
[27] Use 1 teaspoon of baking soda for the bread.
[28] Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the bread.
[29] For the topping use 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
[30] For the topping use 1/3 cup brown sugar.
[31] For the topping use 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.
[32] Optional: use 1 cup of chopped walnuts.
[33] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit once all ingredients are gathered.
[34] Step 2 is to prepare the bananas.
[35] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl.
[36] Bananas with a few spots are acceptable for this recipe.
[37] Cut away any very black parts of bananas if those parts are unappealing.
[38] Peel off any clingy banana strings.
[39] Using a sturdy utensil, thoroughly smash the bananas until mostly liquified.
[40] Be careful when smashing bananas because a utensil could break from excessive force.
[41] Smashing bananas can serve as a stress reliever or an arm workout.
[42] Stop smashing when the bananas are mostly liquified but still have a few bits for texture.
[43] Step 3 is a sweet start where butter and sugars are combined.
[44] Ensure the butter is softened but not melted before combining with sugar.
[45] Combine the softened butter with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
[46] Use a fork or a strong whisk to blend the butter and sugars.
[47] Mix the butter and sugars until the mixture is well blended and creamy.
[48] Step 4 is to mix the wet ingredients with the mashed bananas.
[49] Beat the eggs and add them to the vanilla and the butter/sugar mixture.
[50] Combine the beaten eggs, vanilla, and butter/sugar mixture into the mashed bananas.
[51] If adding walnuts, add them when combining the wet ingredients into the bananas.
[52] Step 5 is to add dry ingredients and finish the batter.
[53] Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the banana/egg mixture.
[54] Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt into the batter until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated.
[55] Pour the finished batter into the chosen cooking pan.
[56] This recipe can be made as muffins, a loaf, or a cake.
[57] Step 6 is to prepare the topping.
[58] Blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until the mixture becomes very crumbly.
[59] Sprinkle the crumbly topping over the batter.
[60] It is acceptable to make extra topping and apply it thickly.
[61] Typically, butter is used to make a streusel topping.
[62] The recipe uses oil for the topping because there is already a stick of butter in the batter and the presenter is trying to reduce butter intake.
[63] If preferred, replace the oil with 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.
[64] Step 7 is to bake the muffins or chosen pan of batter.
[65] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit if not already preheated.
[66] Bake the batter for a time appropriate to the chosen pan.
[67] Bake muffins for 18 to 20 minutes.
[68] Test muffins with a clean knife or toothpick to ensure they are done.
[69] Let the baked goods cool on a rack for 15 minutes or until they can be safely touched.
[70] After cooling for 15 minutes, proceed with serving or storing the muffins as desired.
[71] The presenter implies the remaining steps (serving and eating) are straightforward.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Purposes (i.e., Label each guidance sentence or ingredient-descriptor by the primary goal or role it serves: appearance/texture goals, release/removal aims, safety/quality concerns, or the role of an element as core, finish, or product claim.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Aesthetic
Definition: Instructions whose main goal is to achieve a particular appearance or texture (e.g., domes, crumb, surface texture, fluffiness).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Context 2: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S2] Release
Definition: Guidance intended to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking to pans or liners (coating pans, using liners, nonstick spray).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Purposes (i.e., Label each guidance sentence or ingredient-descriptor by the primary goal or role it serves: appearance/texture goals, release/removal aims, safety/quality concerns, or the role of an element as core, finish, or product claim.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Aesthetic
Definition: Instructions whose main goal is to achieve a particular appearance or texture (e.g., domes, crumb, surface texture, fluffiness).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Context 2: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S2] Release
Definition: Guidance intended to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking to pans or liners (coating pans, using liners, nonstick spray).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups
	- Context 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
	- Content 2: give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups
	- Context 2: Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
```
[S3] Safety
Definition: Advice focused on ensuring proper bake quality, safe handling, and avoiding burning (timing, temperature, doneness checks).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
	- Context 2: Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
```
[S4] Core
Definition: Ingredients or instructions that define the recipe's main flavor or identity (primary flavor components or essential ingredients).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Context 1: The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: you're going to add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries
	- Context 2: Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
```
[S5] Finish
Definition: Toppings or finishing elements added after assembly to modify appearance, texture, or serving (final touches like streusel, chips, or sprinkles).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: a brown sugar streusel
	- Context 1: Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
	- Content 2: sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins
	- Context 2: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a sky-high bakery top and a crisp edge?
[2] I'm going to show you how to make moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a bakery-style top and crisp edge.
[3] This is Preppy Kitchen and John Kanell teaches how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with family and friends.
[4] These chocolate chip muffins whip up quickly.
[5] Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[6] A high blast of heat when the muffins go in sets the edge and lets the muffins rise up to form a bakery-style dome.
[7] Baking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit causes the muffins to spread out and not form the desired bakery-style muffin.
[8] Prepare the dry ingredients.
[9] Use a scale for the most accurate results when measuring ingredients.
[10] If you are using cups instead of a scale, watch the 'how to measure flour' video for proper measuring technique.
[11] The 'how to measure flour' video shows all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[12] Measuring flour incorrectly is the thing that goes wrong most often in baking.
[13] Adding too much flour to a recipe negatively affects baking results.
[14] Place a sifter and a bowl on the work surface for dry ingredients.
[15] Add 2 and 3/14 cups (330 grams) of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
[16] Add one teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.
[17] Use one teaspoon of salt to provide contrast to the chocolate and sugar and to amp the flavor.
[18] Add one tablespoon of baking powder for leavening.
[19] Using a relatively large amount of baking powder helps produce a bakery-style top.
[20] Sift the dry ingredients.
[21] Set the scale aside after measuring.
[22] Give the sifted dry ingredients a quick whisk.
[23] Set the whisked dry ingredients aside.
[24] Melted butter was prepared a minute earlier.
[25] The melted butter has cooled down.
[26] Warm the cooled butter in the microwave if needed.
[27] Keep wet ingredients at room temperature for best results.
[28] If wet ingredients get cold, warm them in the microwave.
[29] The counter is very cold and will cool ingredients down.
[30] Measure 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of whole milk.
[31] Add the measured whole milk to the wet ingredients bowl.
[32] Add half a cup (113 grams) of unsalted butter that has been melted.
[33] Scrape all melted butter into the wet ingredients bowl.
[34] Introduce Brian as a first-time filmer for Preppy Kitchen today.
[35] Brian is present behind the camera and is eating cookies made by the host.
[36] Add one cup (200 grams) of sugar to the wet ingredients bowl.
[37] Give the wet ingredients a little whisk to combine them.
[38] If clumps of butter appear when mixing wet ingredients, microwave the mixture for 40 seconds to fix it.
[39] Using warm milk helps prevent butter clumps when mixing wet ingredients.
[40] Add two large eggs to the wet ingredient bowl.
[41] Add 1 1/4 cups of sour cream to the wet ingredient bowl.
[42] If sour cream is unavailable, use full-fat plain yogurt instead.
[43] Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract (optional).
[44] Whisk the wet ingredients together.
[45] The wet mixture can turn into a butter mush if the ingredients are not properly combined.
[46] If the wet mixture becomes a butter mush, apply a little heat in the microwave after whisking the eggs in.
[47] Do not microwave the wet mixture before whisking the eggs because the eggs could be overcooked.
[48] A small amount of heat will remedy issues with the wet mixture consistency.
[49] Warm the wet mixture briefly and then whisk it again.
[50] Aim for a nice, homogenous, fluid wet mixture.
[51] Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
[52] Whisk the combined wet and dry ingredients to almost combined.
[53] Having a few clumps of flour in the batter is acceptable because further mixing will occur after adding chocolate chips.
[54] It is fine to have a couple clumps of flour in the batter at this stage.
[55] Prepare chocolate for the batter.
[56] The recipe specifies 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
[57] The instructor is using one cup semisweet and half a cup bittersweet chocolate for a richer mix.
[58] You can use milk chocolate if you prefer.
[59] Reserve a handful of semisweet chocolate chips to sprinkle on top of the muffins for appearance.
[60] Add the rest of the chocolate chips to the batter.
[61] Fold the chocolate chips into the batter with a spatula rather than using a whisk.
[62] After folding in the chocolate chips, transfer the batter into the muffin tins.
[63] Demonstrate two methods of baking: naked muffins (no paper liners) and muffins in paper liners.
[64] Expect differences in appearance between muffins baked naked and muffins baked in paper liners.
[65] Butter and flour half of the muffin tins as a release method.
[66] Coat butter across the muffin cavity, add a good dash of flour, move the flour around, and dump out the excess flour.
[67] Use paper muffin liners for the rest of the tin cavities to produce taller muffins but with less crisp edge.
[68] Paper liners go a bit higher and prevent the mushroom-shaped muffin top while still allowing a nice dome.
[69] Transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[70] If you prefer a nice crispy muffin edge, bake without paper liners.
[71] When baking without paper liners, be careful to add enough butter and flour so muffins pop out easily.
[72] Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[73] Fill the muffin cavities all the way to the top for big bakery-style muffins.
[74] Normally cupcake batter fills two-thirds of the way, but for these muffins the cups should be filled full.
[75] When filling paper liners, avoid getting batter on the edges to prevent burning.
[76] Batter on the edges will burn and mainly affects appearance rather than bake quality.
[77] Monitor chocolate chip distribution while scooping the batter to ensure even chip distribution.
[78] If a scoop lacks chocolate chips, add some chips to that scoop to balance distribution.
[79] After filling muffin cavities, top the muffins with a scattering of reserved chocolate chips.
[80] Adding chocolate chips on top gives glossy, melty chocolate tops and significantly improves appearance.
[81] Chocolate chip muffins look naked without chocolate chips on top.
[82] This recipe yields exactly 12 large muffins.
[83] High initial oven heat locks in the muffin edge so the top can burst through and form a bakery-style dome.
[84] Bake the muffins at 425°F for five minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
[85] Bake until the top is nicely golden and the center is set.
[86] Insert a skewer into the center of a muffin to check doneness; it should come out clean except for molten chocolate.
[87] Place the muffin tin into the oven.
[88] Remove the muffins from the oven and cool them just enough to touch before handling.
[89] Muffins baked without paper liners have a crisp edge, a little muffin overhang, and a golden brown color.
[90] Muffins baked in paper liners are guided upward by the paper, are a bit taller, and lack the crisp edge.
[91] Muffins baked in paper liners feel soft all over.
[92] Inspect the inside of a muffin to evaluate crumb and chocolate distribution.
[93] If you like the video, check out the host's chocolate playlist.
[94] There is someone making funny faces behind the camera.
[95] The chocolate playlist contains the host's favorite chocolate recipes which are very delicious.
[96] Now taste a muffin.
[97] The muffin tastes exceptionally good and perfect.
[98] If you like the videos, hit the like button and subscribe.
[99] The host will see viewers in the next video.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Purposes (i.e., Label each guidance sentence or ingredient-descriptor by the primary goal or role it serves: appearance/texture goals, release/removal aims, safety/quality concerns, or the role of an element as core, finish, or product claim.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Aesthetic
Definition: Instructions whose main goal is to achieve a particular appearance or texture (e.g., domes, crumb, surface texture, fluffiness).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Context 2: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S2] Release
Definition: Guidance intended to ensure easy removal or prevent sticking to pans or liners (coating pans, using liners, nonstick spray).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups
	- Context 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
	- Content 2: give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups
	- Context 2: Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
```
[S3] Safety
Definition: Advice focused on ensuring proper bake quality, safe handling, and avoiding burning (timing, temperature, doneness checks).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
	- Context 2: Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
```
[S4] Core
Definition: Ingredients or instructions that define the recipe's main flavor or identity (primary flavor components or essential ingredients).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Context 1: The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: you're going to add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries
	- Context 2: Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
```
[S5] Finish
Definition: Toppings or finishing elements added after assembly to modify appearance, texture, or serving (final touches like streusel, chips, or sprinkles).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: a brown sugar streusel
	- Context 1: Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
	- Content 2: sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins
	- Context 2: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S6] Product
Definition: General claims about the final product's expected qualities (texture, flavor, appeal) or promotional descriptions about results or yield.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe
	- Context 1: Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
	- Content 2: you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy
	- Context 2: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
```
[S7] Method
Definition: Procedural actions to combine, mix, measure, or shape ingredients (assembly steps to prepare batter or portions).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
	- Context 1: The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar. We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
	- Content 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
	- Context 2: Your batter should be thick but also spreadable. We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
```
[S8] Adaptation
Definition: Advice on substitutions, flexible ingredient choices, or tips for modifying the recipe to suit preferences or dietary needs.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract
	- Context 1: Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
	- Content 2: this time you're only going to add in 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 1/4 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix
	- Context 2: Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding. This time you're only going to add in 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 1/4 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
```
[S9] Equipment
Definition: Mention of tools, utensils, or bakeware needed to perform the recipe (scales, sifters, scoops, tins, mixers).

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com.
[2] Today I'll be showing you how to make fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[3] The muffins are loaded with a ton of blueberries.
[4] The muffins are topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[5] Start by combining all dry ingredients.
[6] In a large bowl, combine two cups of all-purpose flour.
[7] In a large bowl, add one teaspoon of baking powder.
[8] In a large bowl, add half a teaspoon of baking soda.
[9] In a large bowl, add a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[10] Whisk the dry ingredients together.
[11] Reserve one tablespoon of the flour mixture.
[12] Mix the reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[13] The reason for adding a small amount of flour to the blueberries is related to when the blueberries are added to the batter.
[14] Coating blueberries in flour prevents the blueberries from sinking as fast during baking.
[15] Add three eggs into a large bowl.
[16] Whisk the three eggs on high speed using an electric mixer.
[17] Whisk the eggs for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[18] Continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[19] Keep beating the eggs for about three more minutes after adding the sugar.
[20] Well-beaten eggs are the key to really fluffy muffins.
[21] Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[22] Add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[23] Continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarters of a cup of heavy cream.
[24] Begin adding the dry ingredients to the wet mixture rather than adding all at once.
[25] Do not add all of the dry ingredients to the batter at once.
[26] Get a sifter.
[27] Add about a third of the flour mixture at a time to the batter.
[28] Mix between each addition of the flour mixture.
[29] Once all of the dry ingredients are well combined into the muffin batter, the batter is ready for the next step.
[30] Continue beating the batter with an electric mixer while preparing to add butter.
[31] Slowly and gradually add four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter to the batter.
[32] The last step before portioning is adding the blueberries.
[33] Fold the blueberries into the batter with a spatula.
[34] Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
[35] Begin scooping the batter into the lined muffin tin using a large cookie scoop.
[36] Top each muffin with a few extra blueberries if desired.
[37] Topping muffins with extra blueberries is optional.
[38] Before baking, make a simple streusel topping.
[39] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.

[28] Add one half of the all-purpose flour now.
[29] Use a total of 2 cups of all-purpose flour in the recipe.
[30] Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour at this stage.
[31] Use the rubber spatula to stir the flour in.
[32] Once white specks of flour start to disappear, pour in 1/2 cup of milk or buttermilk.

[43] If making a larger batch, it is okay to let the batter rest between baking different batches.
[44] Bake muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[45] After 7 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[46] Continue baking for 12–15 minutes and watch muffins carefully because cooking time varies by oven.
[47] Start variations with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[48] A lemon blueberry muffin demonstrates using another flavor of extract and adding fresh fruit.

[50] Continue with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk for the lemon blueberry variation.
[51] After finishing the batter for lemon blueberry muffins, add 1 cup of fresh blueberries.
[52] You can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh blueberries.
[53] Optionally add the zest of 1 lemon, about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[54] Fold lemon zest and blueberries into the batter.
[55] Divide the lemon blueberry batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups.
[56] Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of muffins as a topping option.
[57] Sprinkling granulated sugar on top gives muffins a crunchy sweet top.
[58] Bake lemon blueberry muffins using the same baking procedure as the base recipe.
[59] Make a chocolate muffin version next.
[60] For a chocolate version, use butter and sugar as before and add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.
[61] Cream unsweetened cocoa powder in with the butter and sugar.
[62] Proceed with the master muffin recipe by adding eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk for the chocolate variation.
[63] Adding cocoa powder does not significantly change the texture of the final batter.
[64] Add 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold them into the chocolate batter.
[65] When mixing add-ins, keep the total amount of additions (chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit) to 1 cup total.
[66] Demonstrate a muffin hack using instant pudding to switch up flavors quickly.
[67] For the pudding variation, use only 3/4 cup of granulated sugar.
[68] Replace the missing 1/4 cup of sugar with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix.
[69] Use pistachio instant pudding mix as one flavor option.
[70] Cream the pudding mix and adjusted sugar together with the butter as directed and proceed with the master muffin recipe.
[71] You can fold in chopped pistachios into the pudding-flavored batter if desired.
[72] Instant pudding variation is fun because many flavors of instant pudding make it easy to mix and match flavors quickly without buying many extracts.
[73] Show how easy it is to mix and match add-ins to add flavor without much hassle.
[74] Demonstrate a cranberry white chocolate chip muffin with a little bit of orange zest.
[75] Use the master recipe with no alterations as the base for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[76] Add 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.

[78] If no orange extract is available, add 1/2 tablespoon of orange zest total to add a hint of orange flavor.
[79] Fold in add-ins until ingredients are evenly distributed.
[80] You can use chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts as add-in options because possibilities are endless.
[81] Show how to add spices to the muffin base.
[82] Demonstrate a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in topped with a brown sugar streusel.
[83] Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract before adding cinnamon for the cinnamon variation.
[84] Add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[85] You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[86] Adjust the amount of cinnamon depending on how pronounced you want the cinnamon flavor.
[87] Finish the cinnamon muffin batter with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk.
[88] Fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips.
[89] Cinnamon chips can be harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[90] Divide the batter into prepared muffin cups before making the streusel topping.
[91] A streusel is easy to make and is a decadent addition to many muffin flavors.
[92] Start streusel with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
[93] Add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the streusel.
[94] Add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour to the streusel.
[95] Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the streusel.
[96] Use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the streusel ingredients together.
[97] Cut streusel together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[98] Sprinkle the streusel generously on top of muffin batter.
[99] The streusel looks like little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[100] The baking time for muffins with streusel and other variations is the same as the base recipe.
[101] You can make almost any muffin flavor using one master recipe.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Focus objects (i.e., Label content according to whether it refers to components mixed into the batter (interior), components applied on top or as finishing (exterior), or descriptions about the whole muffin product.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Filling
Definition: Ingredients or instructions intended to be mixed into the batter or incorporated into the interior of the muffin (e.g., ingredients stirred or folded into batter).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries
	- Context 1: once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
	- Content 2: fold in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips
	- Context 2: Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
```
[S2] Topping
Definition: Components applied on top of the muffin or used as a finishing touch (e.g., streusel, butter, drizzles, or anything placed on/added after baking).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top
	- Context 1: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
	- Content 2: topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel
	- Context 2: They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
```
[S3] Product
Definition: Descriptions or claims about the overall muffin product, including appearance, texture, or general character of the finished muffins.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: my Master Muffin Recipe
	- Context 1: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
	- Content 2: fluffy and moist blueberry muffins
	- Context 2: Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
```
[S4] Action
Definition: Procedural steps or actions (preparation, mixing, chilling, baking instructions) that describe how to perform tasks but do not specifically name interior or exterior components.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit
	- Context 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups
	- Context 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
```
- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Going to the grocery store has become a difficult quest to find the perfect bananas.
[2] The Clothier household prefers bananas that are still a bit green.
[3] Greener bananas are firmer.
[4] Greener bananas have a better flavor.
[5] Decide how many bananas to buy based on how many will be eaten in the next few days.
[6] Consider whether one banana per day per person is appropriate when deciding how many to buy.
[7] Consider whether bananas will be used in cereal or other dishes when deciding how many to buy.
[8] The ripeness (how green the bananas are) is the most important factor in deciding whether to buy them.
[9] Sometimes buy some bananas that will be perfect in a couple of days and some that are perfect right now.
[10] Sometimes one or two bananas go uneaten or ripen faster than expected.
[11] Banana bread (and similar banana baked goods) was likely created to use bananas that are blackening before they go to waste.
[12] The muffins have a crumbly coating on top.
[13] The crumbly topping adds texture and flavor to the muffins.
[14] The added texture and flavor from the crumble is worth the extra calories.
[15] The presenter does not make these muffins often.
[16] The presenter does not worry much about how unhealthy the muffins might be.
[17] If concerned about calories, using the gym is an option.
[18] Step 1 is the list of ingredients.
[19] Ingredients for the bread are listed separately from the topping and optional items.
[20] Use 3 to 4 bananas, mashed, for the bread.
[21] Use 2 cups of all-purpose flour for the bread.
[22] Use 3/4 cup white sugar for the bread.
[23] Use 1/4 cup brown sugar for the bread.
[24] Use 1 stick of butter, softened, for the bread.
[25] Use 2 eggs, slightly beaten, for the bread.
[26] Use 1 teaspoon of vanilla for the bread.
[27] Use 1 teaspoon of baking soda for the bread.
[28] Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the bread.
[29] For the topping use 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
[30] For the topping use 1/3 cup brown sugar.
[31] For the topping use 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.
[32] Optional: use 1 cup of chopped walnuts.
[33] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit once all ingredients are gathered.
[34] Step 2 is to prepare the bananas.
[35] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl.
[36] Bananas with a few spots are acceptable for this recipe.
[37] Cut away any very black parts of bananas if those parts are unappealing.
[38] Peel off any clingy banana strings.
[39] Using a sturdy utensil, thoroughly smash the bananas until mostly liquified.
[40] Be careful when smashing bananas because a utensil could break from excessive force.
[41] Smashing bananas can serve as a stress reliever or an arm workout.
[42] Stop smashing when the bananas are mostly liquified but still have a few bits for texture.
[43] Step 3 is a sweet start where butter and sugars are combined.
[44] Ensure the butter is softened but not melted before combining with sugar.
[45] Combine the softened butter with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
[46] Use a fork or a strong whisk to blend the butter and sugars.
[47] Mix the butter and sugars until the mixture is well blended and creamy.
[48] Step 4 is to mix the wet ingredients with the mashed bananas.
[49] Beat the eggs and add them to the vanilla and the butter/sugar mixture.
[50] Combine the beaten eggs, vanilla, and butter/sugar mixture into the mashed bananas.
[51] If adding walnuts, add them when combining the wet ingredients into the bananas.
[52] Step 5 is to add dry ingredients and finish the batter.
[53] Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the banana/egg mixture.
[54] Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt into the batter until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated.
[55] Pour the finished batter into the chosen cooking pan.
[56] This recipe can be made as muffins, a loaf, or a cake.
[57] Step 6 is to prepare the topping.
[58] Blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until the mixture becomes very crumbly.
[59] Sprinkle the crumbly topping over the batter.
[60] It is acceptable to make extra topping and apply it thickly.
[61] Typically, butter is used to make a streusel topping.
[62] The recipe uses oil for the topping because there is already a stick of butter in the batter and the presenter is trying to reduce butter intake.
[63] If preferred, replace the oil with 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.
[64] Step 7 is to bake the muffins or chosen pan of batter.
[65] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit if not already preheated.
[66] Bake the batter for a time appropriate to the chosen pan.
[67] Bake muffins for 18 to 20 minutes.
[68] Test muffins with a clean knife or toothpick to ensure they are done.
[69] Let the baked goods cool on a rack for 15 minutes or until they can be safely touched.
[70] After cooling for 15 minutes, proceed with serving or storing the muffins as desired.
[71] The presenter implies the remaining steps (serving and eating) are straightforward.

ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Focus objects (i.e., Label content according to whether it refers to components mixed into the batter (interior), components applied on top or as finishing (exterior), or descriptions about the whole muffin product.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Filling
Definition: Ingredients or instructions intended to be mixed into the batter or incorporated into the interior of the muffin (e.g., ingredients stirred or folded into batter).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries
	- Context 1: once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
	- Content 2: fold in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips
	- Context 2: Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
```
[S2] Topping
Definition: Components applied on top of the muffin or used as a finishing touch (e.g., streusel, butter, drizzles, or anything placed on/added after baking).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top
	- Context 1: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
	- Content 2: topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a sky-high bakery top and a crisp edge?
[2] I'm going to show you how to make moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with a bakery-style top and crisp edge.
[3] This is Preppy Kitchen and John Kanell teaches how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with family and friends.
[4] These chocolate chip muffins whip up quickly.
[5] Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[6] A high blast of heat when the muffins go in sets the edge and lets the muffins rise up to form a bakery-style dome.
[7] Baking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit causes the muffins to spread out and not form the desired bakery-style muffin.
[8] Prepare the dry ingredients.
[9] Use a scale for the most accurate results when measuring ingredients.
[10] If you are using cups instead of a scale, watch the 'how to measure flour' video for proper measuring technique.
[11] The 'how to measure flour' video shows all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[12] Measuring flour incorrectly is the thing that goes wrong most often in baking.
[13] Adding too much flour to a recipe negatively affects baking results.
[14] Place a sifter and a bowl on the work surface for dry ingredients.
[15] Add 2 and 3/14 cups (330 grams) of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
[16] Add one teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.
[17] Use one teaspoon of salt to provide contrast to the chocolate and sugar and to amp the flavor.
[18] Add one tablespoon of baking powder for leavening.
[19] Using a relatively large amount of baking powder helps produce a bakery-style top.
[20] Sift the dry ingredients.
[21] Set the scale aside after measuring.
[22] Give the sifted dry ingredients a quick whisk.
[23] Set the whisked dry ingredients aside.
[24] Melted butter was prepared a minute earlier.
[25] The melted butter has cooled down.
[26] Warm the cooled butter in the microwave if needed.
[27] Keep wet ingredients at room temperature for best results.
[28] If wet ingredients get cold, warm them in the microwave.
[29] The counter is very cold and will cool ingredients down.
[30] Measure 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of whole milk.
[31] Add the measured whole milk to the wet ingredients bowl.
[32] Add half a cup (113 grams) of unsalted butter that has been melted.
[33] Scrape all melted butter into the wet ingredients bowl.
[34] Introduce Brian as a first-time filmer for Preppy Kitchen today.
[35] Brian is present behind the camera and is eating cookies made by the host.
[36] Add one cup (200 grams) of sugar to the wet ingredients bowl.
[37] Give the wet ingredients a little whisk to combine them.
[38] If clumps of butter appear when mixing wet ingredients, microwave the mixture for 40 seconds to fix it.
[39] Using warm milk helps prevent butter clumps when mixing wet ingredients.
[40] Add two large eggs to the wet ingredient bowl.
[41] Add 1 1/4 cups of sour cream to the wet ingredient bowl.
[42] If sour cream is unavailable, use full-fat plain yogurt instead.
[43] Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract (optional).
[44] Whisk the wet ingredients together.
[45] The wet mixture can turn into a butter mush if the ingredients are not properly combined.
[46] If the wet mixture becomes a butter mush, apply a little heat in the microwave after whisking the eggs in.
[47] Do not microwave the wet mixture before whisking the eggs because the eggs could be overcooked.
[48] A small amount of heat will remedy issues with the wet mixture consistency.
[49] Warm the wet mixture briefly and then whisk it again.
[50] Aim for a nice, homogenous, fluid wet mixture.
[51] Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
[52] Whisk the combined wet and dry ingredients to almost combined.
[53] Having a few clumps of flour in the batter is acceptable because further mixing will occur after adding chocolate chips.
[54] It is fine to have a couple clumps of flour in the batter at this stage.
[55] Prepare chocolate for the batter.
[56] The recipe specifies 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
[57] The instructor is using one cup semisweet and half a cup bittersweet chocolate for a richer mix.
[58] You can use milk chocolate if you prefer.
[59] Reserve a handful of semisweet chocolate chips to sprinkle on top of the muffins for appearance.
[60] Add the rest of the chocolate chips to the batter.
[61] Fold the chocolate chips into the batter with a spatula rather than using a whisk.
[62] After folding in the chocolate chips, transfer the batter into the muffin tins.
[63] Demonstrate two methods of baking: naked muffins (no paper liners) and muffins in paper liners.
[64] Expect differences in appearance between muffins baked naked and muffins baked in paper liners.
[65] Butter and flour half of the muffin tins as a release method.
[66] Coat butter across the muffin cavity, add a good dash of flour, move the flour around, and dump out the excess flour.
[67] Use paper muffin liners for the rest of the tin cavities to produce taller muffins but with less crisp edge.
[68] Paper liners go a bit higher and prevent the mushroom-shaped muffin top while still allowing a nice dome.
[69] Transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[70] If you prefer a nice crispy muffin edge, bake without paper liners.
[71] When baking without paper liners, be careful to add enough butter and flour so muffins pop out easily.
[72] Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[73] Fill the muffin cavities all the way to the top for big bakery-style muffins.
[74] Normally cupcake batter fills two-thirds of the way, but for these muffins the cups should be filled full.
[75] When filling paper liners, avoid getting batter on the edges to prevent burning.
[76] Batter on the edges will burn and mainly affects appearance rather than bake quality.
[77] Monitor chocolate chip distribution while scooping the batter to ensure even chip distribution.
[78] If a scoop lacks chocolate chips, add some chips to that scoop to balance distribution.
[79] After filling muffin cavities, top the muffins with a scattering of reserved chocolate chips.
[80] Adding chocolate chips on top gives glossy, melty chocolate tops and significantly improves appearance.
[81] Chocolate chip muffins look naked without chocolate chips on top.
[82] This recipe yields exactly 12 large muffins.
[83] High initial oven heat locks in the muffin edge so the top can burst through and form a bakery-style dome.
[84] Bake the muffins at 425°F for five minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
[85] Bake until the top is nicely golden and the center is set.
[86] Insert a skewer into the center of a muffin to check doneness; it should come out clean except for molten chocolate.
[87] Place the muffin tin into the oven.
[88] Remove the muffins from the oven and cool them just enough to touch before handling.
[89] Muffins baked without paper liners have a crisp edge, a little muffin overhang, and a golden brown color.
[90] Muffins baked in paper liners are guided upward by the paper, are a bit taller, and lack the crisp edge.
[91] Muffins baked in paper liners feel soft all over.
[92] Inspect the inside of a muffin to evaluate crumb and chocolate distribution.
[93] If you like the video, check out the host's chocolate playlist.
[94] There is someone making funny faces behind the camera.
[95] The chocolate playlist contains the host's favorite chocolate recipes which are very delicious.
[96] Now taste a muffin.
[97] The muffin tastes exceptionally good and perfect.

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Filling
Definition: Ingredients or instructions intended to be mixed into the batter or incorporated into the interior of the muffin (e.g., ingredients stirred or folded into batter).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries
	- Context 1: once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
	- Content 2: fold in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips
	- Context 2: Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
```
[S2] Topping
Definition: Components applied on top of the muffin or used as a finishing touch (e.g., streusel, butter, drizzles, or anything placed on/added after baking).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top
	- Context 1: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
	- Content 2: topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel
	- Context 2: They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com.
[2] Today I'll be showing you how to make fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[3] The muffins are loaded with a ton of blueberries.
[4] The muffins are topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[5] Start by combining all dry ingredients.
[6] In a large bowl, combine two cups of all-purpose flour.
[7] In a large bowl, add one teaspoon of baking powder.
[8] In a large bowl, add half a teaspoon of baking soda.
[9] In a large bowl, add a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[10] Whisk the dry ingredients together.
[11] Reserve one tablespoon of the flour mixture.
[12] Mix the reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[13] The reason for adding a small amount of flour to the blueberries is related to when the blueberries are added to the batter.
[14] Coating blueberries in flour prevents the blueberries from sinking as fast during baking.
[15] Add three eggs into a large bowl.
[16] Whisk the three eggs on high speed using an electric mixer.
[17] Whisk the eggs for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[18] Continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[19] Keep beating the eggs for about three more minutes after adding the sugar.
[20] Well-beaten eggs are the key to really fluffy muffins.
[21] Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[22] Add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[23] Continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarters of a cup of heavy cream.
[24] Begin adding the dry ingredients to the wet mixture rather than adding all at once.
[25] Do not add all of the dry ingredients to the batter at once.
[26] Get a sifter.
[27] Add about a third of the flour mixture at a time to the batter.
[28] Mix between each addition of the flour mixture.
[29] Once all of the dry ingredients are well combined into the muffin batter, the batter is ready for the next step.
[30] Continue beating the batter with an electric mixer while preparing to add butter.
[31] Slowly and gradually add four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter to the batter.
[32] The last step before portioning is adding the blueberries.
[33] Fold the blueberries into the batter with a spatula.
[34] Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
[35] Begin scooping the batter into the lined muffin tin using a large cookie scoop.
[36] Top each muffin with a few extra blueberries if desired.
[37] Topping muffins with extra blueberries is optional.
[38] Before baking, make a simple streusel topping.
[39] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[40] Mash the streusel ingredients together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined.
[41] Mash the streusel ingredients until they have a crumbly texture.
[42] Top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping.
[43] Bake the topped muffins in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[2] Instead of giving dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, present a single Master Muffin Recipe.
[3] Use the Master Muffin Recipe to make almost any flavor of muffin.
[4] The Master Muffin Recipe is super easy.
[5] Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[6] Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[7] Spritz nonstick cooking spray on paper baking cups to prevent muffins from sticking.
[8] Prepare the batter.
[9] Demonstrate a basic muffin batter first.
[10] Show 5 different variations that build upon the base recipe.
[11] Start the batter with 1 cup of softened salted butter.
[12] Start the batter with 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[13] Use a hand mixer to cream together butter and sugar.
[14] At first the butter and sugar mixture will be lumpy.
[15] Keep mixing the butter and sugar for about 2 minutes.
[16] After 2 minutes the sugar and butter will be well combined.
[17] After 2 minutes the mixture will have a smooth, creamy paste-like consistency.
[18] Add in 2 large eggs.
[19] Mix the eggs into the butter and sugar briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[20] Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[21] You can use other flavors of extract such as almond, orange, or lemon.
[22] Use 1 teaspoon for lemon and other citrus extracts and combine that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[23] Add 2 teaspoons of baking powder.
[24] Add 1 teaspoon of salt.
[25] Add any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice at this point.
[26] Give the mixture a quick mix for about 10 seconds to combine after adding baking powder, salt, and any spices.
[27] Stop using the hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula at this point.
[28] Add one half of the all-purpose flour now.
[29] Use a total of 2 cups of all-purpose flour in the recipe.
[30] Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour at this stage.
[31] Use the rubber spatula to stir the flour in.
[32] Once white specks of flour start to disappear, pour in 1/2 cup of milk or buttermilk.
[33] Buttermilk gives a poofier muffin.
[34] Stir the milk or buttermilk into the batter until well combined.
[35] Add the remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour.
[36] Stir the batter together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything gets mixed in.
[37] Add dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries into the batter after it is mixed if desired.
[38] The batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[39] Divide the batter among the 12 muffin cups.
[40] Fill each muffin cup about two-thirds of the way full.
[41] Try to divide the batter as evenly as possible because the recipe makes 12 muffins.
[42] Let muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before baking if desired.
[43] If making a larger batch, it is okay to let the batter rest between baking different batches.
[44] Bake muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[45] After 7 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[46] Continue baking for 12–15 minutes and watch muffins carefully because cooking time varies by oven.
[47] Start variations with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[48] A lemon blueberry muffin demonstrates using another flavor of extract and adding fresh fruit.
[49] After creaming sugar and butter and adding eggs, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before baking powder and salt for the lemon blueberry variation.
[50] Continue with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk for the lemon blueberry variation.
[51] After finishing the batter for lemon blueberry muffins, add 1 cup of fresh blueberries.
[52] You can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh blueberries.
[53] Optionally add the zest of 1 lemon, about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[54] Fold lemon zest and blueberries into the batter.
[55] Divide the lemon blueberry batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups.
[56] Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of muffins as a topping option.
[57] Sprinkling granulated sugar on top gives muffins a crunchy sweet top.
[58] Bake lemon blueberry muffins using the same baking procedure as the base recipe.
[59] Make a chocolate muffin version next.
[60] For a chocolate version, use butter and sugar as before and add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.
[61] Cream unsweetened cocoa powder in with the butter and sugar.
[62] Proceed with the master muffin recipe by adding eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk for the chocolate variation.
[63] Adding cocoa powder does not significantly change the texture of the final batter.
[64] Add 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold them into the chocolate batter.
[65] When mixing add-ins, keep the total amount of additions (chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit) to 1 cup total.
[66] Demonstrate a muffin hack using instant pudding to switch up flavors quickly.
[67] For the pudding variation, use only 3/4 cup of granulated sugar.
[68] Replace the missing 1/4 cup of sugar with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix.
[69] Use pistachio instant pudding mix as one flavor option.
[70] Cream the pudding mix and adjusted sugar together with the butter as directed and proceed with the master muffin recipe.
[71] You can fold in chopped pistachios into the pudding-flavored batter if desired.
[72] Instant pudding variation is fun because many flavors of instant pudding make it easy to mix and match flavors quickly without buying many extracts.
[73] Show how easy it is to mix and match add-ins to add flavor without much hassle.
[74] Demonstrate a cranberry white chocolate chip muffin with a little bit of orange zest.
[75] Use the master recipe with no alterations as the base for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[76] Add 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[77] Add 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips so the total add-ins equal 1 cup.
[78] If no orange extract is available, add 1/2 tablespoon of orange zest total to add a hint of orange flavor.
[79] Fold in add-ins until ingredients are evenly distributed.
[80] You can use chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts as add-in options because possibilities are endless.
[81] Show how to add spices to the muffin base.
[82] Demonstrate a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in topped with a brown sugar streusel.
[83] Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract before adding cinnamon for the cinnamon variation.
[84] Add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[85] You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[86] Adjust the amount of cinnamon depending on how pronounced you want the cinnamon flavor.
[87] Finish the cinnamon muffin batter with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk.
[88] Fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips.
[89] Cinnamon chips can be harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[90] Divide the batter into prepared muffin cups before making the streusel topping.
[91] A streusel is easy to make and is a decadent addition to many muffin flavors.
[92] Start streusel with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
[93] Add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the streusel.
[94] Add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour to the streusel.
[95] Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the streusel.
[96] Use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the streusel ingredients together.
[97] Cut streusel together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[98] Sprinkle the streusel generously on top of muffin batter.
[99] The streusel looks like little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[100] The baking time for muffins with streusel and other variations is the same as the base recipe.
[101] You can make almost any muffin flavor using one master recipe.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Property types (i.e., Label declarative statements that assert a property of an ingredient by which kind of attribute they claim: texture, flavor, or ripeness/visual state.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Texture
Definition: Claims about an ingredient's or finished item's physical feel, mouthfeel, firmness/softness, or form that affects texture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: softened salted butter
	- Context 1: [42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: thick but also spreadable
	- Context 2: [150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
```
[S2] Flavor
Definition: Claims about taste, seasoning, or flavor qualities of an ingredient or the final product.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
	- Context 1: [210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract...
	- Content 2: a nice little crunchy sweet top
	- Context 2: [248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. [255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S3] Ripeness
Definition: Statements about color, visual state, or degree of maturation or ingredient state (e.g., fresh, frozen, green, ripe, overripe).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fresh blueberries
	- Context 1: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
	- Content 2: frozen even
	- Context 2: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
```
[S4] Temperature
Definition: Statements about the temperature or thermal state of an ingredient or finished item (e.g., room temperature, chilled, warm, oven temperature, storage temperature).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit
	- Context 1: [14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: cold cubed butter
	- Context 2: [462 - 465] It starts with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
```

[42] To make the muffins dairy-free, replace the buttermilk with unsweetened almond milk.
[43] To avoid refined sugar, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.
[44] Use coconut oil or grapeseed oil instead of canola oil as alternatives.
[45] Bake times may differ for those who live at high elevation.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Property types (i.e., Label declarative statements that assert a property of an ingredient by which kind of attribute they claim: texture, flavor, or ripeness/visual state.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Texture
Definition: Claims about an ingredient's or finished item's physical feel, mouthfeel, firmness/softness, or form that affects texture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: softened salted butter
	- Context 1: [42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: thick but also spreadable
	- Context 2: [150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
```
[S2] Flavor
Definition: Claims about taste, seasoning, or flavor qualities of an ingredient or the final product.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
	- Context 1: [210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract...
	- Content 2: a nice little crunchy sweet top
	- Context 2: [248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. [255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S3] Ripeness
Definition: Statements about color, visual state, or degree of maturation or ingredient state (e.g., fresh, frozen, green, ripe, overripe).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fresh blueberries
	- Context 1: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
	- Content 2: frozen even
	- Context 2: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
```
[S4] Temperature
Definition: Statements about the temperature or thermal state of an ingredient or finished item (e.g., room temperature, chilled, warm, oven temperature, storage temperature).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit
	- Context 1: [14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: cold cubed butter
	- Context 2: [462 - 465] It starts with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
```
- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Going to the grocery store has become a difficult quest to find the perfect bananas.
[2] The Clothier household prefers bananas that are still a bit green.
[3] Greener bananas are firmer.
[4] Greener bananas have a better flavor.
[5] Decide how many bananas to buy based on how many will be eaten in the next few days.
[6] Consider whether one banana per day per person is appropriate when deciding how many to buy.
[7] Consider whether bananas will be used in cereal or other dishes when deciding how many to buy.
[8] The ripeness (how green the bananas are) is the most important factor in deciding whether to buy them.
[9] Sometimes buy some bananas that will be perfect in a couple of days and some that are perfect right now.
[10] Sometimes one or two bananas go uneaten or ripen faster than expected.
[11] Banana bread (and similar banana baked goods) was likely created to use bananas that are blackening before they go to waste.
[12] The muffins have a crumbly coating on top.
[13] The crumbly topping adds texture and flavor to the muffins.
[14] The added texture and flavor from the crumble is worth the extra calories.
[15] The presenter does not make these muffins often.
[16] The presenter does not worry much about how unhealthy the muffins might be.
[17] If concerned about calories, using the gym is an option.
[18] Step 1 is the list of ingredients.
[19] Ingredients for the bread are listed separately from the topping and optional items.
[20] Use 3 to 4 bananas, mashed, for the bread.
[21] Use 2 cups of all-purpose flour for the bread.
[22] Use 3/4 cup white sugar for the bread.
[23] Use 1/4 cup brown sugar for the bread.
[24] Use 1 stick of butter, softened, for the bread.
[25] Use 2 eggs, slightly beaten, for the bread.
[26] Use 1 teaspoon of vanilla for the bread.
[27] Use 1 teaspoon of baking soda for the bread.
[28] Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the bread.
[29] For the topping use 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
[30] For the topping use 1/3 cup brown sugar.
[31] For the topping use 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.
[32] Optional: use 1 cup of chopped walnuts.
[33] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit once all ingredients are gathered.
[34] Step 2 is to prepare the bananas.
[35] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl.
[36] Bananas with a few spots are acceptable for this recipe.
[37] Cut away any very black parts of bananas if those parts are unappealing.
[38] Peel off any clingy banana strings.
[39] Using a sturdy utensil, thoroughly smash the bananas until mostly liquified.
[40] Be careful when smashing bananas because a utensil could break from excessive force.
[41] Smashing bananas can serve as a stress reliever or an arm workout.
[42] Stop smashing when the bananas are mostly liquified but still have a few bits for texture.
[43] Step 3 is a sweet start where butter and sugars are combined.
[44] Ensure the butter is softened but not melted before combining with sugar.
[45] Combine the softened butter with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
[46] Use a fork or a strong whisk to blend the butter and sugars.
[47] Mix the butter and sugars until the mixture is well blended and creamy.
[48] Step 4 is to mix the wet ingredients with the mashed bananas.
[49] Beat the eggs and add them to the vanilla and the butter/sugar mixture.
[50] Combine the beaten eggs, vanilla, and butter/sugar mixture into the mashed bananas.
[51] If adding walnuts, add them when combining the wet ingredients into the bananas.
[52] Step 5 is to add dry ingredients and finish the batter.
[53] Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the banana/egg mixture.
[54] Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt into the batter until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated.
[55] Pour the finished batter into the chosen cooking pan.
[56] This recipe can be made as muffins, a loaf, or a cake.
[57] Step 6 is to prepare the topping.
[58] Blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until the mixture becomes very crumbly.
[59] Sprinkle the crumbly topping over the batter.
[60] It is acceptable to make extra topping and apply it thickly.
[61] Typically, butter is used to make a streusel topping.
[62] The recipe uses oil for the topping because there is already a stick of butter in the batter and the presenter is trying to reduce butter intake.
[63] If preferred, replace the oil with 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.
[64] Step 7 is to bake the muffins or chosen pan of batter.
[65] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit if not already preheated.
[66] Bake the batter for a time appropriate to the chosen pan.
[67] Bake muffins for 18 to 20 minutes.
[68] Test muffins with a clean knife or toothpick to ensure they are done.
[69] Let the baked goods cool on a rack for 15 minutes or until they can be safely touched.
[70] After cooling for 15 minutes, proceed with serving or storing the muffins as desired.
[71] The presenter implies the remaining steps (serving and eating) are straightforward.

ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Property types (i.e., Label declarative statements that assert a property of an ingredient by which kind of attribute they claim: texture, flavor, or ripeness/visual state.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Texture
Definition: Claims about an ingredient's or finished item's physical feel, mouthfeel, firmness/softness, or form that affects texture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: softened salted butter
	- Context 1: [42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: thick but also spreadable
	- Context 2: [150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
```
[S2] Flavor
Definition: Claims about taste, seasoning, or flavor qualities of an ingredient or the final product.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
	- Context 1: [210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract...
	- Content 2: a nice little crunchy sweet top
	- Context 2: [248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. [255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S3] Ripeness
Definition: Statements about color, visual state, or degree of maturation or ingredient state (e.g., fresh, frozen, green, ripe, overripe).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fresh blueberries
	- Context 1: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
	- Content 2: frozen even
	- Context 2: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
```
[S4] Temperature
Definition: Statements about the temperature or thermal state of an ingredient or finished item (e.g., room temperature, chilled, warm, oven temperature, storage temperature).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit
	- Context 1: [14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Property types (i.e., Label declarative statements that assert a property of an ingredient by which kind of attribute they claim: texture, flavor, or ripeness/visual state.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Texture
Definition: Claims about an ingredient's or finished item's physical feel, mouthfeel, firmness/softness, or form that affects texture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: softened salted butter
	- Context 1: [42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: thick but also spreadable
	- Context 2: [150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
```
[S2] Flavor
Definition: Claims about taste, seasoning, or flavor qualities of an ingredient or the final product.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
	- Context 1: [210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract...
	- Content 2: a nice little crunchy sweet top
	- Context 2: [248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. [255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S3] Ripeness
Definition: Statements about color, visual state, or degree of maturation or ingredient state (e.g., fresh, frozen, green, ripe, overripe).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fresh blueberries
	- Context 1: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
	- Content 2: frozen even
	- Context 2: [221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
```
[S4] Temperature
Definition: Statements about the temperature or thermal state of an ingredient or finished item (e.g., room temperature, chilled, warm, oven temperature, storage temperature).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit
	- Context 1: [14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: cold cubed butter
	- Context 2: [462 - 465] It starts with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
```
- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] These are my blueberry muffins.
[2] Mmm, my favorite muffin.
[3] Add grated lemon zest to a large mixing bowl.
[4] Add a milk of choice to a large mixing bowl.
[5] The instructor is using soy milk.
[6] Add sugar to a large mixing bowl.
[7] Add a neutral vegetable oil to a large mixing bowl.
[8] Add vanilla extract to a large mixing bowl.
[9] Whisk the ingredients well until they are well combined.
[10] Sift flour into the bowl along with baking powder.
[11] Add a pinch of salt while sifting the flour.
[12] Adding flour with baking powder and salt makes muffins soft and fluffy.
[13] Whisk wet and dry ingredients for a short minute until lumps are gone.
[14] Do not overmix the batter.
[15] Rinse the blueberries.
[16] Shake the water off the blueberries.
[17] Add the blueberries to a bowl after rinsing and shaking off the water.
[18] Toss the blueberries with cornstarch.
[19] Add the cornstarch-coated blueberries to the batter.
[20] Stir the blueberries in the mixture gently.
[21] Fold the blueberries into the mixture gently.
[22] Transfer the batter to the muffin liners.
[23] This recipe yields about 12 muffins.
[24] Fill the muffin liners almost to the top.
[25] Optionally sprinkle sugar on top of the muffins.
[26] Do not sprinkle sugar because the muffins are intended for breakfast.
[27] Bake the muffins in a preheated oven for 22 and a half minutes.
[28] Bake the muffins until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
[29] Let the muffins cool down for about 30 minutes.
[30] Easy, right?

[6] A high blast of heat when the muffins go in sets the edge and lets the muffins rise up to form a bakery-style dome.
[7] Baking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit causes the muffins to spread out and not form the desired bakery-style muffin.
[8] Prepare the dry ingredients.
[9] Use a scale for the most accurate results when measuring ingredients.
[10] If you are using cups instead of a scale, watch the 'how to measure flour' video for proper measuring technique.
[11] The 'how to measure flour' video shows all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[12] Measuring flour incorrectly is the thing that goes wrong most often in baking.
[13] Adding too much flour to a recipe negatively affects baking results.
[14] Place a sifter and a bowl on the work surface for dry ingredients.
[15] Add 2 and 3/14 cups (330 grams) of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
[16] Add one teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.
[17] Use one teaspoon of salt to provide contrast to the chocolate and sugar and to amp the flavor.
[18] Add one tablespoon of baking powder for leavening.
[19] Using a relatively large amount of baking powder helps produce a bakery-style top.
[20] Sift the dry ingredients.
[21] Set the scale aside after measuring.
[22] Give the sifted dry ingredients a quick whisk.
[23] Set the whisked dry ingredients aside.
[24] Melted butter was prepared a minute earlier.
[25] The melted butter has cooled down.
[26] Warm the cooled butter in the microwave if needed.
[27] Keep wet ingredients at room temperature for best results.
[28] If wet ingredients get cold, warm them in the microwave.
[29] The counter is very cold and will cool ingredients down.
[30] Measure 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of whole milk.
[31] Add the measured whole milk to the wet ingredients bowl.
[32] Add half a cup (113 grams) of unsalted butter that has been melted.
[33] Scrape all melted butter into the wet ingredients bowl.
[34] Introduce Brian as a first-time filmer for Preppy Kitchen today.
[35] Brian is present behind the camera and is eating cookies made by the host.
[36] Add one cup (200 grams) of sugar to the wet ingredients bowl.
[37] Give the wet ingredients a little whisk to combine them.
[38] If clumps of butter appear when mixing wet ingredients, microwave the mixture for 40 seconds to fix it.
[39] Using warm milk helps prevent butter clumps when mixing wet ingredients.
[40] Add two large eggs to the wet ingredient bowl.
[41] Add 1 1/4 cups of sour cream to the wet ingredient bowl.
[42] If sour cream is unavailable, use full-fat plain yogurt instead.
[43] Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract (optional).
[44] Whisk the wet ingredients together.
[45] The wet mixture can turn into a butter mush if the ingredients are not properly combined.
[46] If the wet mixture becomes a butter mush, apply a little heat in the microwave after whisking the eggs in.
[47] Do not microwave the wet mixture before whisking the eggs because the eggs could be overcooked.
[48] A small amount of heat will remedy issues with the wet mixture consistency.
[49] Warm the wet mixture briefly and then whisk it again.
[50] Aim for a nice, homogenous, fluid wet mixture.
[51] Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
[52] Whisk the combined wet and dry ingredients to almost combined.
[53] Having a few clumps of flour in the batter is acceptable because further mixing will occur after adding chocolate chips.
[54] It is fine to have a couple clumps of flour in the batter at this stage.
[55] Prepare chocolate for the batter.
[56] The recipe specifies 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
[57] The instructor is using one cup semisweet and half a cup bittersweet chocolate for a richer mix.
[58] You can use milk chocolate if you prefer.
[59] Reserve a handful of semisweet chocolate chips to sprinkle on top of the muffins for appearance.
[60] Add the rest of the chocolate chips to the batter.
[61] Fold the chocolate chips into the batter with a spatula rather than using a whisk.
[62] After folding in the chocolate chips, transfer the batter into the muffin tins.
[63] Demonstrate two methods of baking: naked muffins (no paper liners) and muffins in paper liners.
[64] Expect differences in appearance between muffins baked naked and muffins baked in paper liners.
[65] Butter and flour half of the muffin tins as a release method.
[66] Coat butter across the muffin cavity, add a good dash of flour, move the flour around, and dump out the excess flour.
[67] Use paper muffin liners for the rest of the tin cavities to produce taller muffins but with less crisp edge.
[68] Paper liners go a bit higher and prevent the mushroom-shaped muffin top while still allowing a nice dome.
[69] Transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[70] If you prefer a nice crispy muffin edge, bake without paper liners.
[71] When baking without paper liners, be careful to add enough butter and flour so muffins pop out easily.
[72] Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[73] Fill the muffin cavities all the way to the top for big bakery-style muffins.
[74] Normally cupcake batter fills two-thirds of the way, but for these muffins the cups should be filled full.
[75] When filling paper liners, avoid getting batter on the edges to prevent burning.
[76] Batter on the edges will burn and mainly affects appearance rather than bake quality.
[77] Monitor chocolate chip distribution while scooping the batter to ensure even chip distribution.
[78] If a scoop lacks chocolate chips, add some chips to that scoop to balance distribution.
[79] After filling muffin cavities, top the muffins with a scattering of reserved chocolate chips.
[80] Adding chocolate chips on top gives glossy, melty chocolate tops and significantly improves appearance.
[81] Chocolate chip muffins look naked without chocolate chips on top.
[82] This recipe yields exactly 12 large muffins.
[83] High initial oven heat locks in the muffin edge so the top can burst through and form a bakery-style dome.
[84] Bake the muffins at 425°F for five minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
[85] Bake until the top is nicely golden and the center is set.
[86] Insert a skewer into the center of a muffin to check doneness; it should come out clean except for molten chocolate.
[87] Place the muffin tin into the oven.
[88] Remove the muffins from the oven and cool them just enough to touch before handling.
[89] Muffins baked without paper liners have a crisp edge, a little muffin overhang, and a golden brown color.
[90] Muffins baked in paper liners are guided upward by the paper, are a bit taller, and lack the crisp edge.
[91] Muffins baked in paper liners feel soft all over.
[92] Inspect the inside of a muffin to evaluate crumb and chocolate distribution.
[93] If you like the video, check out the host's chocolate playlist.
[94] There is someone making funny faces behind the camera.
[95] The chocolate playlist contains the host's favorite chocolate recipes which are very delicious.
[96] Now taste a muffin.
[97] The muffin tastes exceptionally good and perfect.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Property types (i.e., Label declarative statements that assert a property of an ingredient by which kind of attribute they claim: texture, flavor, or ripeness/visual state.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Texture
Definition: Claims about an ingredient's or finished item's physical feel, mouthfeel, firmness/softness, or form that affects texture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: softened salted butter
	- Context 1: [42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: thick but also spreadable
	- Context 2: [150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
```
[S2] Flavor
Definition: Claims about taste, seasoning, or flavor qualities of an ingredient or the final product.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
	- Context 1: [210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract...
	- Content 2: a nice little crunchy sweet top
	- Context 2: [248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. [255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
```
[S3] Ripeness
Definition: Statements about color, visual state, or degree of maturation or ingredient state (e.g., fresh, frozen, green, ripe, overripe).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fresh blueberries

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com.
[2] Today I'll be showing you how to make fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[3] The muffins are loaded with a ton of blueberries.
[4] The muffins are topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[5] Start by combining all dry ingredients.
[6] In a large bowl, combine two cups of all-purpose flour.
[7] In a large bowl, add one teaspoon of baking powder.
[8] In a large bowl, add half a teaspoon of baking soda.
[9] In a large bowl, add a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[10] Whisk the dry ingredients together.
[11] Reserve one tablespoon of the flour mixture.
[12] Mix the reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[13] The reason for adding a small amount of flour to the blueberries is related to when the blueberries are added to the batter.
[14] Coating blueberries in flour prevents the blueberries from sinking as fast during baking.
[15] Add three eggs into a large bowl.
[16] Whisk the three eggs on high speed using an electric mixer.
[17] Whisk the eggs for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[18] Continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[19] Keep beating the eggs for about three more minutes after adding the sugar.
[20] Well-beaten eggs are the key to really fluffy muffins.
[21] Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[22] Add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[23] Continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarters of a cup of heavy cream.
[24] Begin adding the dry ingredients to the wet mixture rather than adding all at once.
[25] Do not add all of the dry ingredients to the batter at once.
[26] Get a sifter.
[27] Add about a third of the flour mixture at a time to the batter.
[28] Mix between each addition of the flour mixture.
[29] Once all of the dry ingredients are well combined into the muffin batter, the batter is ready for the next step.
[30] Continue beating the batter with an electric mixer while preparing to add butter.
[31] Slowly and gradually add four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter to the batter.
[32] The last step before portioning is adding the blueberries.
[33] Fold the blueberries into the batter with a spatula.
[34] Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
[35] Begin scooping the batter into the lined muffin tin using a large cookie scoop.
[36] Top each muffin with a few extra blueberries if desired.
[37] Topping muffins with extra blueberries is optional.
[38] Before baking, make a simple streusel topping.
[39] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[40] Mash the streusel ingredients together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined.
[41] Mash the streusel ingredients until they have a crumbly texture.
[42] Top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping.
[43] Bake the topped muffins in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Property types (i.e., Label declarative statements that assert a property of an ingredient by which kind of attribute they claim: texture, flavor, or ripeness/visual state.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Texture
Definition: Claims about an ingredient's or finished item's physical feel, mouthfeel, firmness/softness, or form that affects texture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: softened salted butter
	- Context 1: [42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
	- Content 2: thick but also spreadable
	- Context 2: [150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
```

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[2] Instead of giving dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, present a single Master Muffin Recipe.
[3] Use the Master Muffin Recipe to make almost any flavor of muffin.
[4] The Master Muffin Recipe is super easy.
[5] Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[6] Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[7] Spritz nonstick cooking spray on paper baking cups to prevent muffins from sticking.
[8] Prepare the batter.
[9] Demonstrate a basic muffin batter first.
[10] Show 5 different variations that build upon the base recipe.
[11] Start the batter with 1 cup of softened salted butter.
[12] Start the batter with 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[13] Use a hand mixer to cream together butter and sugar.
[14] At first the butter and sugar mixture will be lumpy.
[15] Keep mixing the butter and sugar for about 2 minutes.
[16] After 2 minutes the sugar and butter will be well combined.
[17] After 2 minutes the mixture will have a smooth, creamy paste-like consistency.
[18] Add in 2 large eggs.
[19] Mix the eggs into the butter and sugar briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[20] Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[21] You can use other flavors of extract such as almond, orange, or lemon.
[22] Use 1 teaspoon for lemon and other citrus extracts and combine that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[23] Add 2 teaspoons of baking powder.
[24] Add 1 teaspoon of salt.
[25] Add any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice at this point.
[26] Give the mixture a quick mix for about 10 seconds to combine after adding baking powder, salt, and any spices.
[27] Stop using the hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula at this point.
[28] Add one half of the all-purpose flour now.
[29] Use a total of 2 cups of all-purpose flour in the recipe.
[30] Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour at this stage.
[31] Use the rubber spatula to stir the flour in.
[32] Once white specks of flour start to disappear, pour in 1/2 cup of milk or buttermilk.
[33] Buttermilk gives a poofier muffin.
[34] Stir the milk or buttermilk into the batter until well combined.
[35] Add the remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour.
[36] Stir the batter together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything gets mixed in.
[37] Add dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries into the batter after it is mixed if desired.
[38] The batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[39] Divide the batter among the 12 muffin cups.
[40] Fill each muffin cup about two-thirds of the way full.
[41] Try to divide the batter as evenly as possible because the recipe makes 12 muffins.
[42] Let muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before baking if desired.
[43] If making a larger batch, it is okay to let the batter rest between baking different batches.
[44] Bake muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[45] After 7 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[46] Continue baking for 12–15 minutes and watch muffins carefully because cooking time varies by oven.
[47] Start variations with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[48] A lemon blueberry muffin demonstrates using another flavor of extract and adding fresh fruit.
[49] After creaming sugar and butter and adding eggs, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before baking powder and salt for the lemon blueberry variation.
[50] Continue with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk for the lemon blueberry variation.
[51] After finishing the batter for lemon blueberry muffins, add 1 cup of fresh blueberries.
[52] You can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh blueberries.
[53] Optionally add the zest of 1 lemon, about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[54] Fold lemon zest and blueberries into the batter.
[55] Divide the lemon blueberry batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups.
[56] Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of muffins as a topping option.
[57] Sprinkling granulated sugar on top gives muffins a crunchy sweet top.
[58] Bake lemon blueberry muffins using the same baking procedure as the base recipe.
[59] Make a chocolate muffin version next.
[60] For a chocolate version, use butter and sugar as before and add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.
[61] Cream unsweetened cocoa powder in with the butter and sugar.
[62] Proceed with the master muffin recipe by adding eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk for the chocolate variation.
[63] Adding cocoa powder does not significantly change the texture of the final batter.
[64] Add 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold them into the chocolate batter.
[65] When mixing add-ins, keep the total amount of additions (chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit) to 1 cup total.
[66] Demonstrate a muffin hack using instant pudding to switch up flavors quickly.
[67] For the pudding variation, use only 3/4 cup of granulated sugar.
[68] Replace the missing 1/4 cup of sugar with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix.
[69] Use pistachio instant pudding mix as one flavor option.
[70] Cream the pudding mix and adjusted sugar together with the butter as directed and proceed with the master muffin recipe.
[71] You can fold in chopped pistachios into the pudding-flavored batter if desired.
[72] Instant pudding variation is fun because many flavors of instant pudding make it easy to mix and match flavors quickly without buying many extracts.
[73] Show how easy it is to mix and match add-ins to add flavor without much hassle.
[74] Demonstrate a cranberry white chocolate chip muffin with a little bit of orange zest.
[75] Use the master recipe with no alterations as the base for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[76] Add 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[77] Add 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips so the total add-ins equal 1 cup.
[78] If no orange extract is available, add 1/2 tablespoon of orange zest total to add a hint of orange flavor.
[79] Fold in add-ins until ingredients are evenly distributed.
[80] You can use chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts as add-in options because possibilities are endless.
[81] Show how to add spices to the muffin base.
[82] Demonstrate a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in topped with a brown sugar streusel.
[83] Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract before adding cinnamon for the cinnamon variation.
[84] Add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[85] You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[86] Adjust the amount of cinnamon depending on how pronounced you want the cinnamon flavor.
[87] Finish the cinnamon muffin batter with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk.
[88] Fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips.
[89] Cinnamon chips can be harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[90] Divide the batter into prepared muffin cups before making the streusel topping.
[91] A streusel is easy to make and is a decadent addition to many muffin flavors.
[92] Start streusel with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
[93] Add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the streusel.
[94] Add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour to the streusel.
[95] Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the streusel.
[96] Use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the streusel ingredients together.
[97] Cut streusel together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[98] Sprinkle the streusel generously on top of muffin batter.
[99] The streusel looks like little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[100] The baking time for muffins with streusel and other variations is the same as the base recipe.
[101] You can make almost any muffin flavor using one master recipe.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Informational roles (i.e., Label highlighted statements by whether they primarily explain a preference/observation (justification) or serve as an explicit decision criterion/tip (decision factor) for choosing ingredients or actions.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving reasons, observations, or preferences that explain why something is done or chosen (descriptive or promotional language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
	- Context 2: From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
```
[S2] Decision
Definition: A statement framed as a criterion, tip, or instruction to follow when choosing ingredients, tools, or actions (practical decision-making or imperative language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: You should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
	- Context 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
```
[S3] Closing
Definition: A non-informational closing or social remark that does not provide decision criteria or explanations (e.g., greetings, sign-offs, enjoyment prompts).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Thanks for watching.
	- Context 1: Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe. Thanks for watching.
	- Content 2: Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos,
	- Context 2: You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description. Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos, where you can find hundreds of restaurant quality recipes you can easily make at home.

ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Informational roles (i.e., Label highlighted statements by whether they primarily explain a preference/observation (justification) or serve as an explicit decision criterion/tip (decision factor) for choosing ingredients or actions.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving reasons, observations, or preferences that explain why something is done or chosen (descriptive or promotional language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
	- Context 2: From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
```
[S2] Decision
Definition: A statement framed as a criterion, tip, or instruction to follow when choosing ingredients, tools, or actions (practical decision-making or imperative language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: You should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
	- Context 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
```
[S3] Closing
Definition: A non-informational closing or social remark that does not provide decision criteria or explanations (e.g., greetings, sign-offs, enjoyment prompts).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Thanks for watching.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Informational roles (i.e., Label highlighted statements by whether they primarily explain a preference/observation (justification) or serve as an explicit decision criterion/tip (decision factor) for choosing ingredients or actions.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving reasons, observations, or preferences that explain why something is done or chosen (descriptive or promotional language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
	- Context 2: From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
```
[S2] Decision
Definition: A statement framed as a criterion, tip, or instruction to follow when choosing ingredients, tools, or actions (practical decision-making or imperative language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: You should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
	- Context 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
```
[S3] Closing
Definition: A non-informational closing or social remark that does not provide decision criteria or explanations (e.g., greetings, sign-offs, enjoyment prompts).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Thanks for watching.
	- Context 1: Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe. Thanks for watching.
	- Content 2: Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos,
	- Context 2: You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description. Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos, where you can find hundreds of restaurant quality recipes you can easily make at home.
```
- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Going to the grocery store has become a difficult quest to find the perfect bananas.
[2] The Clothier household prefers bananas that are still a bit green.
[3] Greener bananas are firmer.
[4] Greener bananas have a better flavor.
[5] Decide how many bananas to buy based on how many will be eaten in the next few days.
[6] Consider whether one banana per day per person is appropriate when deciding how many to buy.
[7] Consider whether bananas will be used in cereal or other dishes when deciding how many to buy.
[8] The ripeness (how green the bananas are) is the most important factor in deciding whether to buy them.
[9] Sometimes buy some bananas that will be perfect in a couple of days and some that are perfect right now.
[10] Sometimes one or two bananas go uneaten or ripen faster than expected.
[11] Banana bread (and similar banana baked goods) was likely created to use bananas that are blackening before they go to waste.
[12] The muffins have a crumbly coating on top.
[13] The crumbly topping adds texture and flavor to the muffins.
[14] The added texture and flavor from the crumble is worth the extra calories.
[15] The presenter does not make these muffins often.
[16] The presenter does not worry much about how unhealthy the muffins might be.
[17] If concerned about calories, using the gym is an option.
[18] Step 1 is the list of ingredients.
[19] Ingredients for the bread are listed separately from the topping and optional items.
[20] Use 3 to 4 bananas, mashed, for the bread.
[21] Use 2 cups of all-purpose flour for the bread.
[22] Use 3/4 cup white sugar for the bread.
[23] Use 1/4 cup brown sugar for the bread.
[24] Use 1 stick of butter, softened, for the bread.
[25] Use 2 eggs, slightly beaten, for the bread.
[26] Use 1 teaspoon of vanilla for the bread.
[27] Use 1 teaspoon of baking soda for the bread.
[28] Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the bread.
[29] For the topping use 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
[30] For the topping use 1/3 cup brown sugar.
[31] For the topping use 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.
[32] Optional: use 1 cup of chopped walnuts.
[33] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit once all ingredients are gathered.
[34] Step 2 is to prepare the bananas.
[35] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl.
[36] Bananas with a few spots are acceptable for this recipe.
[37] Cut away any very black parts of bananas if those parts are unappealing.
[38] Peel off any clingy banana strings.
[39] Using a sturdy utensil, thoroughly smash the bananas until mostly liquified.
[40] Be careful when smashing bananas because a utensil could break from excessive force.
[41] Smashing bananas can serve as a stress reliever or an arm workout.
[42] Stop smashing when the bananas are mostly liquified but still have a few bits for texture.
[43] Step 3 is a sweet start where butter and sugars are combined.
[44] Ensure the butter is softened but not melted before combining with sugar.
[45] Combine the softened butter with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
[46] Use a fork or a strong whisk to blend the butter and sugars.
[47] Mix the butter and sugars until the mixture is well blended and creamy.
[48] Step 4 is to mix the wet ingredients with the mashed bananas.
[49] Beat the eggs and add them to the vanilla and the butter/sugar mixture.
[50] Combine the beaten eggs, vanilla, and butter/sugar mixture into the mashed bananas.
[51] If adding walnuts, add them when combining the wet ingredients into the bananas.
[52] Step 5 is to add dry ingredients and finish the batter.
[53] Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the banana/egg mixture.
[54] Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt into the batter until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated.
[55] Pour the finished batter into the chosen cooking pan.
[56] This recipe can be made as muffins, a loaf, or a cake.
[57] Step 6 is to prepare the topping.
[58] Blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until the mixture becomes very crumbly.
[59] Sprinkle the crumbly topping over the batter.
[60] It is acceptable to make extra topping and apply it thickly.
[61] Typically, butter is used to make a streusel topping.
[62] The recipe uses oil for the topping because there is already a stick of butter in the batter and the presenter is trying to reduce butter intake.
[63] If preferred, replace the oil with 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.
[64] Step 7 is to bake the muffins or chosen pan of batter.
[65] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit if not already preheated.
[66] Bake the batter for a time appropriate to the chosen pan.
[67] Bake muffins for 18 to 20 minutes.
[68] Test muffins with a clean knife or toothpick to ensure they are done.
[69] Let the baked goods cool on a rack for 15 minutes or until they can be safely touched.
[70] After cooling for 15 minutes, proceed with serving or storing the muffins as desired.
[71] The presenter implies the remaining steps (serving and eating) are straightforward.

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving reasons, observations, or preferences that explain why something is done or chosen (descriptive or promotional language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
	- Context 2: From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
```
[S2] Decision
Definition: A statement framed as a criterion, tip, or instruction to follow when choosing ingredients, tools, or actions (practical decision-making or imperative language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: You should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
	- Context 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.

[29] A fork can be used to mash very ripe bananas if a potato masher is not available.
[30] Add the remaining ingredients to the mashed bananas.
[31] Combine all ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
[32] Image caption: Use regular milk, almond milk, or coconut milk.
[33] Image caption: There is no need to beat the eggs ahead of time; just crack and mix them.
[34] Image caption: Maple syrup was used here but honey is also delicious.
[35] Make the recipe gluten-free by using specially marked containers of whole oats.
[36] There is no worry of over-mixing because this recipe does not use flour.
[37] Prepare to bake by filling muffin cups to the top.
[38] Use a 3-ounce ice cream scoop to evenly distribute muffin batter into pans.
[39] Add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips at the time of filling the cups.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Informational roles (i.e., Label highlighted statements by whether they primarily explain a preference/observation (justification) or serve as an explicit decision criterion/tip (decision factor) for choosing ingredients or actions.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving reasons, observations, or preferences that explain why something is done or chosen (descriptive or promotional language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
	- Context 2: From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
```
[S2] Decision
Definition: A statement framed as a criterion, tip, or instruction to follow when choosing ingredients, tools, or actions (practical decision-making or imperative language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: You should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
	- Context 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
```
[S3] Closing
Definition: A non-informational closing or social remark that does not provide decision criteria or explanations (e.g., greetings, sign-offs, enjoyment prompts).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Thanks for watching.
	- Context 1: Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe. Thanks for watching.
	- Content 2: Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos,
	- Context 2: You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description. Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos, where you can find hundreds of restaurant quality recipes you can easily make at home.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] These are my blueberry muffins.
[2] Mmm, my favorite muffin.
[3] Add grated lemon zest to a large mixing bowl.
[4] Add a milk of choice to a large mixing bowl.
[5] The instructor is using soy milk.
[6] Add sugar to a large mixing bowl.
[7] Add a neutral vegetable oil to a large mixing bowl.
[8] Add vanilla extract to a large mixing bowl.
[9] Whisk the ingredients well until they are well combined.
[10] Sift flour into the bowl along with baking powder.
[11] Add a pinch of salt while sifting the flour.
[12] Adding flour with baking powder and salt makes muffins soft and fluffy.
[13] Whisk wet and dry ingredients for a short minute until lumps are gone.
[14] Do not overmix the batter.
[15] Rinse the blueberries.
[16] Shake the water off the blueberries.
[17] Add the blueberries to a bowl after rinsing and shaking off the water.
[18] Toss the blueberries with cornstarch.
[19] Add the cornstarch-coated blueberries to the batter.
[20] Stir the blueberries in the mixture gently.
[21] Fold the blueberries into the mixture gently.
[22] Transfer the batter to the muffin liners.
[23] This recipe yields about 12 muffins.
[24] Fill the muffin liners almost to the top.
[25] Optionally sprinkle sugar on top of the muffins.
[26] Do not sprinkle sugar because the muffins are intended for breakfast.
[27] Bake the muffins in a preheated oven for 22 and a half minutes.
[28] Bake the muffins until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out dry.
[29] Let the muffins cool down for about 30 minutes.
[30] Easy, right?

[9] Fold the wet ingredients into the dry mixture.
[10] Refrigerate the batter for at least one hour.
[11] Refrigerating the batter for at least one hour helps the muffins rise without overflowing.
[12] Scoop the batter into muffin cases.
[13] Top each muffin with a mix of chocolate chips.
[14] Follow the baking instructions.
[15] That completes the recipe.

[7] Baking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit causes the muffins to spread out and not form the desired bakery-style muffin.
[8] Prepare the dry ingredients.
[9] Use a scale for the most accurate results when measuring ingredients.
[10] If you are using cups instead of a scale, watch the 'how to measure flour' video for proper measuring technique.
[11] The 'how to measure flour' video shows all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[12] Measuring flour incorrectly is the thing that goes wrong most often in baking.
[13] Adding too much flour to a recipe negatively affects baking results.
[14] Place a sifter and a bowl on the work surface for dry ingredients.
[15] Add 2 and 3/14 cups (330 grams) of all-purpose flour into the bowl.
[16] Add one teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.
[17] Use one teaspoon of salt to provide contrast to the chocolate and sugar and to amp the flavor.
[18] Add one tablespoon of baking powder for leavening.
[19] Using a relatively large amount of baking powder helps produce a bakery-style top.
[20] Sift the dry ingredients.
[21] Set the scale aside after measuring.
[22] Give the sifted dry ingredients a quick whisk.
[23] Set the whisked dry ingredients aside.
[24] Melted butter was prepared a minute earlier.
[25] The melted butter has cooled down.
[26] Warm the cooled butter in the microwave if needed.
[27] Keep wet ingredients at room temperature for best results.
[28] If wet ingredients get cold, warm them in the microwave.
[29] The counter is very cold and will cool ingredients down.
[30] Measure 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of whole milk.
[31] Add the measured whole milk to the wet ingredients bowl.
[32] Add half a cup (113 grams) of unsalted butter that has been melted.
[33] Scrape all melted butter into the wet ingredients bowl.
[34] Introduce Brian as a first-time filmer for Preppy Kitchen today.
[35] Brian is present behind the camera and is eating cookies made by the host.
[36] Add one cup (200 grams) of sugar to the wet ingredients bowl.
[37] Give the wet ingredients a little whisk to combine them.
[38] If clumps of butter appear when mixing wet ingredients, microwave the mixture for 40 seconds to fix it.
[39] Using warm milk helps prevent butter clumps when mixing wet ingredients.
[40] Add two large eggs to the wet ingredient bowl.
[41] Add 1 1/4 cups of sour cream to the wet ingredient bowl.
[42] If sour cream is unavailable, use full-fat plain yogurt instead.
[43] Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract (optional).
[44] Whisk the wet ingredients together.
[45] The wet mixture can turn into a butter mush if the ingredients are not properly combined.
[46] If the wet mixture becomes a butter mush, apply a little heat in the microwave after whisking the eggs in.
[47] Do not microwave the wet mixture before whisking the eggs because the eggs could be overcooked.
[48] A small amount of heat will remedy issues with the wet mixture consistency.
[49] Warm the wet mixture briefly and then whisk it again.
[50] Aim for a nice, homogenous, fluid wet mixture.
[51] Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
[52] Whisk the combined wet and dry ingredients to almost combined.
[53] Having a few clumps of flour in the batter is acceptable because further mixing will occur after adding chocolate chips.
[54] It is fine to have a couple clumps of flour in the batter at this stage.
[55] Prepare chocolate for the batter.
[56] The recipe specifies 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
[57] The instructor is using one cup semisweet and half a cup bittersweet chocolate for a richer mix.
[58] You can use milk chocolate if you prefer.
[59] Reserve a handful of semisweet chocolate chips to sprinkle on top of the muffins for appearance.
[60] Add the rest of the chocolate chips to the batter.
[61] Fold the chocolate chips into the batter with a spatula rather than using a whisk.
[62] After folding in the chocolate chips, transfer the batter into the muffin tins.
[63] Demonstrate two methods of baking: naked muffins (no paper liners) and muffins in paper liners.
[64] Expect differences in appearance between muffins baked naked and muffins baked in paper liners.
[65] Butter and flour half of the muffin tins as a release method.
[66] Coat butter across the muffin cavity, add a good dash of flour, move the flour around, and dump out the excess flour.
[67] Use paper muffin liners for the rest of the tin cavities to produce taller muffins but with less crisp edge.
[68] Paper liners go a bit higher and prevent the mushroom-shaped muffin top while still allowing a nice dome.
[69] Transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[70] If you prefer a nice crispy muffin edge, bake without paper liners.
[71] When baking without paper liners, be careful to add enough butter and flour so muffins pop out easily.
[72] Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer batter into the muffin tin.
[73] Fill the muffin cavities all the way to the top for big bakery-style muffins.
[74] Normally cupcake batter fills two-thirds of the way, but for these muffins the cups should be filled full.
[75] When filling paper liners, avoid getting batter on the edges to prevent burning.
[76] Batter on the edges will burn and mainly affects appearance rather than bake quality.
[77] Monitor chocolate chip distribution while scooping the batter to ensure even chip distribution.
[78] If a scoop lacks chocolate chips, add some chips to that scoop to balance distribution.
[79] After filling muffin cavities, top the muffins with a scattering of reserved chocolate chips.
[80] Adding chocolate chips on top gives glossy, melty chocolate tops and significantly improves appearance.
[81] Chocolate chip muffins look naked without chocolate chips on top.
[82] This recipe yields exactly 12 large muffins.
[83] High initial oven heat locks in the muffin edge so the top can burst through and form a bakery-style dome.
[84] Bake the muffins at 425°F for five minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
[85] Bake until the top is nicely golden and the center is set.
[86] Insert a skewer into the center of a muffin to check doneness; it should come out clean except for molten chocolate.
[87] Place the muffin tin into the oven.
[88] Remove the muffins from the oven and cool them just enough to touch before handling.
[89] Muffins baked without paper liners have a crisp edge, a little muffin overhang, and a golden brown color.
[90] Muffins baked in paper liners are guided upward by the paper, are a bit taller, and lack the crisp edge.
[91] Muffins baked in paper liners feel soft all over.
[92] Inspect the inside of a muffin to evaluate crumb and chocolate distribution.
[93] If you like the video, check out the host's chocolate playlist.
[94] There is someone making funny faces behind the camera.
[95] The chocolate playlist contains the host's favorite chocolate recipes which are very delicious.
[96] Now taste a muffin.
[97] The muffin tastes exceptionally good and perfect.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Informational roles (i.e., Label highlighted statements by whether they primarily explain a preference/observation (justification) or serve as an explicit decision criterion/tip (decision factor) for choosing ingredients or actions.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving reasons, observations, or preferences that explain why something is done or chosen (descriptive or promotional language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
	- Context 2: From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
```
[S2] Decision
Definition: A statement framed as a criterion, tip, or instruction to follow when choosing ingredients, tools, or actions (practical decision-making or imperative language).

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com.
[2] Today I'll be showing you how to make fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[3] The muffins are loaded with a ton of blueberries.
[4] The muffins are topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[5] Start by combining all dry ingredients.
[6] In a large bowl, combine two cups of all-purpose flour.
[7] In a large bowl, add one teaspoon of baking powder.
[8] In a large bowl, add half a teaspoon of baking soda.
[9] In a large bowl, add a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[10] Whisk the dry ingredients together.
[11] Reserve one tablespoon of the flour mixture.
[12] Mix the reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[13] The reason for adding a small amount of flour to the blueberries is related to when the blueberries are added to the batter.
[14] Coating blueberries in flour prevents the blueberries from sinking as fast during baking.
[15] Add three eggs into a large bowl.
[16] Whisk the three eggs on high speed using an electric mixer.
[17] Whisk the eggs for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[18] Continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[19] Keep beating the eggs for about three more minutes after adding the sugar.
[20] Well-beaten eggs are the key to really fluffy muffins.
[21] Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[22] Add one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[23] Continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarters of a cup of heavy cream.
[24] Begin adding the dry ingredients to the wet mixture rather than adding all at once.
[25] Do not add all of the dry ingredients to the batter at once.
[26] Get a sifter.
[27] Add about a third of the flour mixture at a time to the batter.
[28] Mix between each addition of the flour mixture.
[29] Once all of the dry ingredients are well combined into the muffin batter, the batter is ready for the next step.
[30] Continue beating the batter with an electric mixer while preparing to add butter.
[31] Slowly and gradually add four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter to the batter.
[32] The last step before portioning is adding the blueberries.
[33] Fold the blueberries into the batter with a spatula.
[34] Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
[35] Begin scooping the batter into the lined muffin tin using a large cookie scoop.
[36] Top each muffin with a few extra blueberries if desired.
[37] Topping muffins with extra blueberries is optional.
[38] Before baking, make a simple streusel topping.
[39] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, one teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[40] Mash the streusel ingredients together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined.
[41] Mash the streusel ingredients until they have a crumbly texture.
[42] Top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping.
[43] Bake the topped muffins in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[44] I hope you enjoyed watching this video; please share, like, and subscribe to the channel.
[45] See you next time!

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial video for Making Muffins based on Informational roles (i.e., Label highlighted statements by whether they primarily explain a preference/observation (justification) or serve as an explicit decision criterion/tip (decision factor) for choosing ingredients or actions.).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Justification
Definition: An explanatory statement giving reasons, observations, or preferences that explain why something is done or chosen (descriptive or promotional language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
	- Context 2: From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
```
[S2] Decision
Definition: A statement framed as a criterion, tip, or instruction to follow when choosing ingredients, tools, or actions (practical decision-making or imperative language).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Context 1: Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
	- Content 2: You should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
	- Context 2: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
```
[S3] Closing
Definition: A non-informational closing or social remark that does not provide decision criteria or explanations (e.g., greetings, sign-offs, enjoyment prompts).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Thanks for watching.
	- Context 1: Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe. Thanks for watching.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[2] Instead of giving dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, present a single Master Muffin Recipe.
[3] Use the Master Muffin Recipe to make almost any flavor of muffin.
[4] The Master Muffin Recipe is super easy.
[5] Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[6] Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[7] Spritz nonstick cooking spray on paper baking cups to prevent muffins from sticking.
[8] Prepare the batter.
[9] Demonstrate a basic muffin batter first.
[10] Show 5 different variations that build upon the base recipe.
[11] Start the batter with 1 cup of softened salted butter.
[12] Start the batter with 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[13] Use a hand mixer to cream together butter and sugar.
[14] At first the butter and sugar mixture will be lumpy.
[15] Keep mixing the butter and sugar for about 2 minutes.
[16] After 2 minutes the sugar and butter will be well combined.
[17] After 2 minutes the mixture will have a smooth, creamy paste-like consistency.
[18] Add in 2 large eggs.
[19] Mix the eggs into the butter and sugar briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[20] Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[21] You can use other flavors of extract such as almond, orange, or lemon.
[22] Use 1 teaspoon for lemon and other citrus extracts and combine that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[23] Add 2 teaspoons of baking powder.
[24] Add 1 teaspoon of salt.
[25] Add any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice at this point.
[26] Give the mixture a quick mix for about 10 seconds to combine after adding baking powder, salt, and any spices.
[27] Stop using the hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula at this point.
[28] Add one half of the all-purpose flour now.
[29] Use a total of 2 cups of all-purpose flour in the recipe.
[30] Add 1 cup of all-purpose flour at this stage.
[31] Use the rubber spatula to stir the flour in.
[32] Once white specks of flour start to disappear, pour in 1/2 cup of milk or buttermilk.
[33] Buttermilk gives a poofier muffin.
[34] Stir the milk or buttermilk into the batter until well combined.
[35] Add the remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour.
[36] Stir the batter together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything gets mixed in.
[37] Add dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries into the batter after it is mixed if desired.
[38] The batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[39] Divide the batter among the 12 muffin cups.
[40] Fill each muffin cup about two-thirds of the way full.
[41] Try to divide the batter as evenly as possible because the recipe makes 12 muffins.
[42] Let muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before baking if desired.
[43] If making a larger batch, it is okay to let the batter rest between baking different batches.
[44] Bake muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[45] After 7 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[46] Continue baking for 12–15 minutes and watch muffins carefully because cooking time varies by oven.
[47] Start variations with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[48] A lemon blueberry muffin demonstrates using another flavor of extract and adding fresh fruit.
[49] After creaming sugar and butter and adding eggs, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before baking powder and salt for the lemon blueberry variation.
[50] Continue with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk for the lemon blueberry variation.
[51] After finishing the batter for lemon blueberry muffins, add 1 cup of fresh blueberries.
[52] You can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh blueberries.
[53] Optionally add the zest of 1 lemon, about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[54] Fold lemon zest and blueberries into the batter.
[55] Divide the lemon blueberry batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups.
[56] Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of muffins as a topping option.
[57] Sprinkling granulated sugar on top gives muffins a crunchy sweet top.
[58] Bake lemon blueberry muffins using the same baking procedure as the base recipe.
[59] Make a chocolate muffin version next.
[60] For a chocolate version, use butter and sugar as before and add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.
[61] Cream unsweetened cocoa powder in with the butter and sugar.
[62] Proceed with the master muffin recipe by adding eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk for the chocolate variation.
[63] Adding cocoa powder does not significantly change the texture of the final batter.
[64] Add 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold them into the chocolate batter.
[65] When mixing add-ins, keep the total amount of additions (chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit) to 1 cup total.
[66] Demonstrate a muffin hack using instant pudding to switch up flavors quickly.
[67] For the pudding variation, use only 3/4 cup of granulated sugar.
[68] Replace the missing 1/4 cup of sugar with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix.
[69] Use pistachio instant pudding mix as one flavor option.
[70] Cream the pudding mix and adjusted sugar together with the butter as directed and proceed with the master muffin recipe.
[71] You can fold in chopped pistachios into the pudding-flavored batter if desired.
[72] Instant pudding variation is fun because many flavors of instant pudding make it easy to mix and match flavors quickly without buying many extracts.
[73] Show how easy it is to mix and match add-ins to add flavor without much hassle.
[74] Demonstrate a cranberry white chocolate chip muffin with a little bit of orange zest.
[75] Use the master recipe with no alterations as the base for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[76] Add 1/2 cup of dried cranberries for the cranberry white chocolate chip variation.
[77] Add 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips so the total add-ins equal 1 cup.
[78] If no orange extract is available, add 1/2 tablespoon of orange zest total to add a hint of orange flavor.
[79] Fold in add-ins until ingredients are evenly distributed.
[80] You can use chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts as add-in options because possibilities are endless.
[81] Show how to add spices to the muffin base.
[82] Demonstrate a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in topped with a brown sugar streusel.
[83] Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract before adding cinnamon for the cinnamon variation.
[84] Add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[85] You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[86] Adjust the amount of cinnamon depending on how pronounced you want the cinnamon flavor.
[87] Finish the cinnamon muffin batter with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding flour and buttermilk.
[88] Fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips.
[89] Cinnamon chips can be harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[90] Divide the batter into prepared muffin cups before making the streusel topping.
[91] A streusel is easy to make and is a decadent addition to many muffin flavors.
[92] Start streusel with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter.
[93] Add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the streusel.
[94] Add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour to the streusel.
[95] Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the streusel.
[96] Use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the streusel ingredients together.
[97] Cut streusel together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[98] Sprinkle the streusel generously on top of muffin batter.
[99] The streusel looks like little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[100] The baking time for muffins with streusel and other variations is the same as the base recipe.
[101] You can make almost any muffin flavor using one master recipe.
