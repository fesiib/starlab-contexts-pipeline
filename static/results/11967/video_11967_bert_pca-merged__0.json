                "content": "many people these days are afraid of stuffing that's cooked inside of a chicken or other bird there are packaged Stove Top Stuffing mixes on the market but the results are synthetic full of chemicals they generally taste pretty awful here's a recipe for a natural Rich flavorful stuffing that's indistinguishable from the classic sage and mushroom stuffings that used to cook in the cavity of the Sunday bird although this is obviously more work than the packaged mix the result is a million times better I was working on perfecting this recipe at a restaurant in Beverly Hills quite a few years back when uh Chef Wolf Gang Puck stopped by he tasted it and told me don't change a thing yeah I know it made him sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger but that's how he always sounded to me the first step of this is to prepare the bread uh you want a loaf that's fairly dense not like a cake loaf don't use like a Wonder Bread or something like that it has to be like real bread um it can be stale but it really won't make any difference here cuz we're going to bake it anyway so if you've got stale use stale if you all you can get is fresh find use fresh um now you're going to cut this up into cubes now we're going to begin making the uh liquid that goes over the top of this bread I'm going to put in cut up red bell peppers I took the garlic cloves and I just sliced them in off um I'm going to add some dried rosemary to this uh this is one of those instances where I'm actually I don't want the high notes of the herb which is why I'm putting that in now I just want that this background deep richness is all we're going for now um with the paprika and we'll put a little bit of salt we're going to we're going to adjust the seasoning later but is salted all the way through so that you don't end up in the end with bread has no saltiness to it at all in within the stuffing okay there's the olive oil now this gets uh usual stick blender treatment this is the Brad that I cubed up um I cubed it fairly large because that's the way that I like it uh if you Cube it too small in the end what you're going to end up with is is really uh like a soup almost of instead of a like a discernable stuffing so I always want to guard against that personally I I don't like that too squishy of soft um texture in the end I want to be able to to identify and taste the bread um okay so I've scraped out the contents of this and we're going to begin mixing it you just really just got to get your hands in there and do it's the only way make it as even as you can and here it is spread out on a single layer in the baking sheet I've preheated the oven to 150 c as soon as it goes in I'm going to lower the temperature and turn the fan on you can play around with these proportions you know up and down these are the ones I'm comfortable with because I've made it many many times I like this the best 160 180 200 the W this is in the oven also you get plenty of time hopefully got plenty of time to cut up your your vegetables the celery the mushrooms and the onions and cut them into um you know reasonable size chunks like inch bre is still toasting in the oven I'm going to begin cooking the other ingredients when the butter is foamed up going to add the uh onions to it and start counting a Time the temperature here on the stove is on a six from 1 to 10 stir this around a little bit let it go for a few 5 minutes by the clock now I'm going to add the celery and a little bit of salt you have to be careful not to overs salt this but you want to make sure that the celery has some salt in there to break it down the salt will exude moisture from the celery in from the onion but you want to you want to make sure the celery is soft in this you don't want it to have nasty hard chunks in the end so stir it around once in a while a little bit let it keep cooking okay it's now been 8 minutes since I added the cery now I'm going to add the mushrooms and the same routine stir them around one once in a while let them continue to cook it's been just over 13 minutes so far but you can you know after you do this a couple time you can just use your own judgment just look at it this is also the time you want to start picking your Sage leaves off preparing the your shien of these to go in don't want to do it too early because the uh Aroma will evaporate into the air but we're getting pretty the mushrooms have been cooking for about 3 minutes now I'm going to kill the Heat and I'm going to add the dark chicken stock by the way this is what chicken stock that's properly made should look like it should be gelatinous not like the stuff you get in the store okay there's no heat on here but I'm using the residual heat in the pan to to make sure that this melts thoroughly into the um into the mixture here okay it's been 40 minutes now the bread came out of the oven you want to make sure that there's no burn on it at all it's I've used a low temperature for a long time this is very rich and a concentrated flavor but it's no it's absolutely not burnt in any way that's important because if it's burnt it'll make the the overall stuffing bitter I transferred the uh cooked vegetables and chicken stock into Bowl that's all I did and I'm adding uh that chipot of sage and now I'm adding all the breadcrumbs to this more like crutons really um and I'm going to mix this up but I'm not going to add the egg yet I'm going to let this sit and absorb all this liquid I don't want to add the egg because first of all it'll start spoilage and second of all it will actually interfere with the absorption of the the liquid by the bread so we're just going to mix this around and let it stand after you're satisfied that it's mixed as well as you can put some cing film over it let it stand for a while go on after about half an hour we remove the clean film I've got the um one whole egg and the egg yolk this up little first sure it breaks up and I'm also going to put a little fresh ground white pepper on this too remember it's had no pepper added so far okay now we're going to stir this up and get ready to start baking it here take a ceramic baking dish I'm going to put some butter and rub the bottom of it with butter just to make sure it doesn't stick as you got egg and bread in there it's kind of classic for sticking to the pan as it's breaking okay put the mixture in here sure you get everything smooth it out now for the first period of cooking I'm going to cover it with foil this will make sure that the bread doesn't end up drying up and and turning chewy which is something you want to make very sure to avoid cuz nobody likes chewy stuffing okay it's going the oven for the first period it's been 30 minutes now remove the cover and it goes back in for the remaining time this is 10 minutes after it's been in the oven without a cover and I'm going to sprinkle some vermouth on it dry vermouth don't have to do this but it's a nice touch and now it's to go back in the oven and now after the last 10 minutes uh I'm going to do is I'm going to put this cover back on it in order to retain some of that moisture so it doesn't all evaporate out now so we want it want the stuffing to be moist just let it sit like this till it cools down also look for my cocktail book cocktails of the South Pacific and Beyond Advanced Mixology available through Amazon online ",

I'll know that some of you will be thinking about stuffing your bird right now but maybe, recently, things have gone a bit humdrum, a little bit samey and you want a little bit more adventure in your stuffing. Don't despair because in this video I'll show you something that will maybe bring back a little bit of the magic. There's enough here to stuff a 4 kg or 10 pound bird. Here I've got 250 g of breadcrumbs. 500 g of finely chopped mushrooms. I actually used a food processor to chop these. 250 g of spring onions or green onions or scallions. Whatever you want to call them. Here's one I didn't prepare earlier. A 150 g of something like either bacon or I'm using a halal salami. A 125 g of butter. 3 tablespoons of freshly chopped rosemary. Dried rosemary is fine too. 4 crushed cloves of garlic. Begin by melting the butter in a large pan. Once the butter is melted, add in the onions, the bacon or in my case, my salami and the garlic. Saut\u00e9 gently until the onions become soft. After about 5 minutes or so, gentle saut\u00e9ing, the onion should be nice and soft. I'll turn off the heat. I'll just season it with a little bit of salt and pepper. Add in all the remaining ingredients: the mushrooms, the breadcrumbs and the rosemary. Give it all a good mix. When everything is nicely mixed, it's ready for use! It's kinda hard to make a bowl of stuffing look attractive but it does taste awesome! So now there's no excuse for the same thing, year in, year out. I do hope that you enjoy good stuffing this year and do join me next time in Titli's Busy Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan. Until next time... Khuda hafiz\ufffd ",

                "content": "- Hey dudes, I'm Hilah and today on Hilah Cooking I'm making spinach stuffed mushrooms. Hidden Valley Ranch asked me to come up with a recipe that would be great for an awards season party and I think these fit the bill because you can make 'em ahead of time, ladies love vegetables and they go really great with champagne and talking about celebrities. (electronic instrumental music) Start out with prepping the mushrooms. I've got some pretty big cremini mushrooms here that I just wiped off with a damp towel to get off all the dusties off and then you just wanna pop the stem out and I find the easiest way to do it it kind of like going around and break this membrane if you need to, sometimes it's not there, but I think fresher mushrooms usually have that little membrane and then just kind of pop it out. And it literally makes a popping sound, so that's cool and then if you're the type of person that makes like your own vegetable stock or chicken stock and stuff, save these mushroom stems, 'cause those go really well in something like that. So I'll show you another one. So once you've got your mushrooms ready to roll, you can push those aside and we'll start mixing up our filling. The base of it is gonna be some cream cheese. Add a little bit of mayonnaise. And I'm gonna add one packet of Hidden Valley salad dressing and seasoning mix. Just get these mixed up together. Okay, so this looks really good. It's all smooth. So we can add the rest of our filling ingredients, so I'm gonna use a little bit of grated cheese. I'm using Monterrey Jack. I think cheddar would be really good too. Some grated carrots. Some finely chopped spinach. Some green onions and some fresh herbs. Today I'm gonna use some dill and parsley, but you could use all dill or all parsley. And then some bread crumbs. You wanna save some to put on the top of the stuffed mushrooms later and I'm gonna add some black pepper. And then just get this all mixed up. Okay, so once you're certain that your mixture is very well combined and there's no streaks of cream cheese or mayonnaise hiding around the bottom, we can stuff the mushrooms. So I'm using a baking tray that I've lined with a little bit of parchment. You don't need to do that, but it makes clean up a little bit easier. So then we can just start filling the mushrooms and I just use a regular spoon and do a teaspoon and a half or two teaspoons, depending on the size of the mushroom. (easy listening instrumental music) Once your mushrooms are all stuffed, you just wanna sprinkle the top of each one with a couple pinches of bread crumbs. Just to make sure you get a nice little toasty brown top and add a little bit of crunch. And if you did wanna make these ahead of time, you could just refrigerate them for up to hour and then bake them whenever you're ready for some hot stuffed mushrooms. So I'm gonna put these in a preheated 400 degree oven and bake 'em for 20 to 25 minutes, until the mushrooms are nice and soft and kind of shrively and the tops are brown and toasty and everything inside is all melty and yummy and gooey. Alright, so 20 minutes later and my house smells amazing and these look gorgeous and I can't wait to eat one. For this recipe, check out hilahcooking.com and for many, many, many more recipes, check out hiddenvalley.com/recipe. Now, let's taste this recipe. They're gonna be hot so beware. Biter beware. Ya'll really should try this. This is one of my favorite stuffed mushroom recipes that I've ever had or even ever created. So thank you so much for watching, thanks for subscribing and I will see ya'll next week. Bye. (electronic instrumental music) ",

                "content": "when it comes to the holidays I have to say my favorite dish is the stuffing I love that mix of flavors and textures and it makes a great leftover before I became a chef I usually prepared the stuff that came in a box but recently I picked it up and read the ingredient label hydrogenated oil hmm monosodium glutamate preservatives and what's this high fructose corn syrup what's that doing in here so this year I'm gonna skip the box stuff and I'm gonna be going into the kitchen and making my own from scratch come and join me and see how it's done for the foundation in our stuffing I went ahead and toasted my bread cubes now I'm using equal parts whole wheat and white and I've toasted these in a really hot oven so they're super super crispy the reason why I want a crispy crouton is so that when you mix it with all the liquids it doesn't fall apart during baking so those are ready to go and now I want to move on here I have my onion my carrot and my celery all ready to go hot pan over medium heat let's turn that up perfect we're gonna add a little bit of olive oil there we go make sure you coat the pan well and because this is a mushroom stuffing recipe we're gonna start off with our mushrooms so here I have some crimini mushrooms all cut up these are gonna go directly in the pan there we go and now I don't like mushrooms that are super soft and squishy so what I want to do watch how I do this I'm going to coat my mushrooms with the oil just like that in the pan and then I'm going to let them sit and if you do this you actually end up searing them as opposed to steaming them if you have too many mushrooms in the pan the mushrooms will want to release all the liquid and then your mushrooms kind of end up soft and mushy that's not my goal in this recipe you can hear how the mushrooms are squeaking in the pan that's good because it means they're not drowning in their own liquid they're searing perfectly now these are done I'm gonna take them off the heat and add a little sprinkle of salt just like that and a few grinds of pepper now you may wonder why I don't add salt and pepper in the beginning well if you add salt it actually helps your mushroom release liquid and again that's not what I wanted I wanted my mushrooms to sear so now that those are seasoned this is gonna go directly over my bread cubes and look at all that fabulous stuff in the bottom of the pan this is called sook s you see it's a French term and it's all the sugars that have caramelized on the bottom of the pan now that equals great flavor so we don't want to lose this that's why I'm not gonna wash the pan again I'm gonna add a little bit more olive oil there we go coat the pan nicely just swirl it around and now it's time to add the rest of our vegetables so I'm gonna add a little bit of garlic because I like just a little bit of bite and then the rest of our vegetables are going in perfect now all we need to do is saute this similar to the mushrooms until they're starting to turn golden brown I don't want to take them too far because I don't want them to turn into mush while they cook I wish you could smell it in here it smells so good you can see that my vegetables are nicely sauteed I don't want to take them too far but I want to get that brown stuff off the bottom of the pan so I'm gonna deglaze with about a cup of white wine that's gonna help me get all those flavors into the vegetables and give a fabulous flavor to the stuffing if you don't want to use an alcohol like wine go ahead and use chicken stock or even water is totally fine I'm going to let this reduce until almost all the liquid is evaporated and then we're ready to move on see how the liquid is nice and reduced it's time to go ahead and add this to our stuffing mix now before I do it I'm in a season with salt and pepper again because I'm creating layers of flavor there we go just a little bit of pepper stir that around and now this goes on top of our bread cubes so pour that on top so now look gorgeous and see how nice and deglaze the pan got that's perfect that's exactly what we were looking for now comes time for the herbs so to this I'm going to add some oregano because I love the flavor of fresh oregano now this is a mushroom in sage stuffing so we want to add our sage now sage is a really strong herb so you don't want to put too much I'm probably gonna use about 1/4 cup in here there we go now for the final step I've got some chicken broth here you can use vegetable that's totally fine to it I'm going to add a couple of eggs now you don't want to do this if you're gonna stuff your turkey with this stuffing because the eggs may not cook all the way through but if you're gonna bake your stuffing it's just fine I'm using eggs as a binding agent if you want to leave them out you can certainly do that I think think they add a really nice texture I'm also using low-sodium chicken broth because again I want to be able to control the salt and the pepper in my recipes perfect so now this just goes on top of our vegetables there we go just get that nice and mixed in now you can see there's still a little bit of liquid that doesn't get absorbed by the bread don't worry that's going to absorb as it bakes this is gonna go directly into our oiled baking dish I just sprayed it with a little bit of nonstick cooking spray there we go now this is going to go into the oven and you're gonna cook it for 30 minutes with foil on top and that's gonna cook it all the way through and then you're gonna take the foil off and cook it for another 15 minutes so that that top gets nice and brown all right we're ready for the oven Wow I wish you can smell it in here it smells so wonderful our stuffing is still nice and moist but look at that beautiful crisp crust this is something that everybody is going to enjoy and it doesn't come from a box I hope you'll join me in making Whole Foods for the holidays happy and healthy eating you ",

                "content": "hey there and welcome to no recipe required tonight I've got a stuffed mushroom dish for now I'm usually not crazy about stuffed mushrooms because I find the mushroom is a little too beefy meaty and frankly me I was a little undercooked and a little water I've got a little trick to take care of that we're gonna get cooking we're gonna get the mushrooms cook down a little bit more or make an awesome filling with some of the mushroom itself some pine nuts of bread crumbs some Parmesan cheese it's absolutely killer let's go ahead and get started okay I've got some cremini mushrooms here and if you are if you're ever gonna do stuff in mushroom you need to be able to follow out a mushroom so on these what I like to use because they've got a nice you know kind of stem that's easy to pull out at a good area in there easiest thing to do if the stem pops out easily this one's not popping out really easily then you know sometimes they just break off you're good to go otherwise you can take a knife here and just go right around the stem I kind of actually hold it on the blade to get full control and just turn it hold the knife still turn the mushroom and you can pop that stem right out you can certainly just go right there put a little stuffing in there or you can then take a spoon and just kind of scrape out the insides and the gills out of the shroom and it's dump those right out on the on the cutting board discard them not a whole lot of use for the gills the stems you can cut off throwing the throw on your stuffing so if you want to just stuff your mushrooms that is absolutely fine but one of the things I actually do is roast off my hollowed-out mushrooms before stuffing because I find them you know these can be it's a pretty big pretty big mushroom to be cooked off and say 20 minutes or 25 minutes in the oven and I find a mobile raw tasting a little kind of soft or undercooked so I pre cook mine for about 25 minutes in the oven 400 degrees and then we'll stuff them we'll throw them back in the oven okay so check out what happens just uh you know 20 minutes or so in the oven to those mushrooms you can see all that liquid is water coming out and if we didn't pre cook them all that water would stay great in the mushrooms so I'm just going to transfer these to our walling dish let them cool then we'll come back and stuff them going to start our mushroom stuffing shockingly it up with mushrooms so I've got all these stems that we pulled out just chopped up finely as well as there's a there's a couple whole mushrooms in there I just add some some extras I'm gonna add that into a saut\u00e9 pan with some olive oil salt and pepper I'm just gonna cook these off over medium heat until the to the water is evaporated out of them and we've got a nice kind of nice firm texture to some mushrooms our wake up down now which is what I'm looking for I'm gonna add in the shallots instead I finally pretty small so I've got three in there one large garlic Pam looks a little jar I'm just gonna put a touch more oil to it and just throw and saute these until everything is nice and soft everything is soft I'm just gonna throw in my tarragon which I'm not using a whole lot that's maybe two pinches right because there isn't frankly a whole lot of stuff in here tarragon I love with mushrooms are you you know you can use parsley you can use basil you can use just about anything you want as long as you got a you know kind of nice fresh thyme in there just kill the heat I'm gonna move these off into a holding bowl just to cool off and then we'll finish off our stuffing okay I've got my stuff in here just cool it off a little bit it doesn't have to be be too cool I'm gonna and about call that it two tablespoons of breadcrumbs an equal amount of Parmesan cheese and then I'm adding some pine nuts as well you fine you know if you really all like them obviously if you're allergic don't add them but one of the things I am remains I don't love about a lot of stock mushrooms is the fact that there's a little texture and that that pine nut that we just added in is going to provide some of that texture I just added a little bit of olive oil cuz my stuffing was looking a little bit moist I like it to be able to you know if you kind of press it to the side it should you know kind of form a little mold there and then we get it mixed together we're gonna taste it we're going to realize we didn't add any salt or pepper now I also like to over season a little bit here because remember we are season in the entire mushroom with just the stuffing right so this I like to be just a little bit salty a little bit peppery no now we're gonna need that seasoning to carry through so our mushrooms have now cooled off to where I can handle them and I'm just gonna okay I'm not gonna do it over the dish I'm gonna do it over my bowl here I'm gonna fill them with my stuffing and then I've got I like to pack it in too tight keep it fairly loose and then just a little bit of Parmesan cheese on each and every one and you can lay them right back down into the into the pan that you did the first roast end and pop them back into that 400-degree oven for probably to another 15 20 minutes or so and if you want or if you need to at the end you're looking for a nice golden-brown crust you can always just throw the Royal broiler on just make sure that cheese melts down and they get you know nice and crispy on top all right so it's time to pop the mushrooms out I got a nice kind of golden brown crust there that's exactly what you're looking for a good kind of crunchy contrast and texture let's go play them up okay if you serve it as a little hors d'oeuvres you can lay them out on a nice little plate like this you know remember there was a little bit of tarragon was the herb we use so you can always throw a little bit of green on the plate to make it look nice and pretty and there you go with our stuffed mushrooms I'll see you next time no recipe required ",

                "content": "hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how I make my shot I call them like my creamy sausage stuffed mushrooms they are absolutely insanely good you're gonna love them and they're really great like lower like a low carb option for your Easter table I've been getting a lot of messages on Instagram to share just a couple of like low carb options for your Easter menu so I feel this would be really great and you can make them into an entree if you want to by just using bigger mushrooms like a portobello mushroom and that would be fantastic but these are gonna be great with a little bit of arugula and fennel salad for either an entree a side dish a starter whatever you fancy let me when you're through the list of in Greensborough beg you need some mushrooms these are just white button mushrooms that I prepped and I'll show you one in just a second I've got a four blend cheese here mozzarella Asiago provolone and lots of freshly grated parm these are the stems from those mushrooms that I just finely chopped onion garlic parsley a little cream cheese Italian sausage salt and a little bit of olive oil now I'm gonna show you how I prepped the mushrooms just to give you an idea of how I did all of them so I just take out the stem and you take the stem and you give it a nice little chopper Roux because this is perfectly edible it's not too hard it's not too tough it's perfect and just take a little teeny tiny teaspoon right and this doesn't have to be pretty because these are gonna be covered so you won't see it but I kind of just get rid of all the center bits so I've got a nice amount of surface area here for the stuffing and that's it I just kind of took a damp paper towel to clean each one and they're good to go to myhouse skillet with a little bit of olive oil I'm gonna add my sausage now I bought my sausage already in book like this out of the casing but if you were using like sausage links do you want to get rid of the casing now I know for a fact that I'm gonna have a lot more filling than I do mushrooms that's because I'm saving some of it to make stuffed mushrooms in the middle of the week I need it twice Omega one huh so that's what I'm doing it so I'm just gonna cook in my skillet over about medium heat medium-high ish heat until the sausage is pretty much fully cooked and you want to break it up as much as you can with a wooden spoon this looks really great now obviously it's not fully cooked through yet but that's okay because it's got a ways to go so now I'm gonna add my diced onion finely chopped onion 1 small 1/2 medium large joy charge you do and the stems of mushrooms right so now to this I'm gonna add a good pinch of salt and cook them all together I'm not gonna add any extra oil or anything just because a sausage already is rendering a little bit of fat and the sausage i buy is quite lean I mean as you can see there's not like a kind of fat rendering but it's just enough that's going to cook everything really nicely that's gonna be so delicious you gotta trust me on this they're really simple and easy but what a fantastic recipe to serve in the middle of the night I mean I like to do these to be honest appetizer side sides are fantastic but I love to do these and really big portobello mushrooms with a lovely side salad perfect weeknight dinner that it's so satisfying and if you are curbing your carbs a couple times a week because if you don't even like me you eat heavy carbs a few times and low carb is a few times it's called balanced then this is so great you're gonna love it so you're gonna keep my eye on this and just cook it until the sauce is develop some color and the mushrooms and onions cook down this looks really great so now I'm gonna just add the garlic add that right in and the parsley I'm just gonna cook this for I don't know like a minute just to kind of cook the garlic a little bit and then I'm gonna add it all to a big bowl and then we'll continue on to make the filling alright this looks amazing to me I mean do it it mmm super yummy now I'm gonna add my cream cheese sounds crazy I know but it is amazingly delicious and it kind of it kind of holds everything together without having to add and the eggs or bread crumbs but it also gives you this lovely creamy component that makes these melt in your Boca mmm so good so I'm just gonna work the cream cheese in the hot sausage mixture just I'm gonna use my spoon because it's nice and easy and now what I've done here so I've done my I'll been preheated to 400 degrees right now because I made the filling in my cast-iron skillet and my cast-iron skillet can go right into my oven what I did was I just added a small drizzle of olive oil to the same skillet I don't even rinse it out because more flavor and more better I'm gonna just cook them in there I mean why get everything else something else dirty if I don't need to right and it's gonna be delicious when it's soaked up the mushrooms are gonna soak up any extra flavor from the bottom of the pan so it's a two-for-one really and we're just about near the end of where we want to be with this mixin so here's what you do now you take your mushroom okay this is a lot of flavor so I don't have to season this at all all right take an ice cream scoop a small one and I do a little bit of that and then go right into your pan and then just continue that's all son look at this look at this I mean honestly now you just take a little bit of your cheese a lot of cheese a lot of is better and then I just found it on each one now I'm gonna pop these into my oven at 400 come on 15 20 minutes or so until golden brown I'll show you what they look like when they are done all right these were in the oven for 15 minutes at 400 look at this look at this gorgeous bronze to cap the bottom is just lovely and juicy the interior you can see is super cheesy I mean I'm into this okay I am all
