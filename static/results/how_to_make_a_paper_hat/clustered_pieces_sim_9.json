        "category": "Arts and Entertainment",
        "content": "hey everybody this is gonna be a tutorial on how to make a paper hat so the first step is you want to draw three shapes that look like this now the first shape you draw is gonna have a curve right there and then the second one is gonna be a little bit less curved but a slant going up there but a small slit and then the third is going to be the smallest piece and the less curved on the edge once you have this drawing out what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut each one out after you cut them out you're gonna have three of these and you're gonna take one of them put them on a white piece of paper and trace around because what you're doing is you're you're making two of each shape and so you're making sure that each one is the same size as the one before because if it's not the hats not gonna fit together correctly and once you have all those traced what you're gonna do is take some scissors and you're gonna cut each one out this is the time to color them and if you want to once you have them all cut out what you're gonna do is you're gonna take one of them and you're gonna draw lines like this around the edge these represent the seams of the Hat and if you want to you can also do a dotted line for these instead but you can do it however you want and you're gonna do that for every single one make sure that for these pieces the two largest ones the slant is going down on that side and going up on that one it's almost like a mirror image once you have them all drawn on what you're gonna do is you're gonna take these to make sure it's those two take a piece of tape tape on the back and then you're gonna put together you are now starting to put the Hat together take another piece of tape and put it on the back and put them together you're gonna be doing this for each one just make sure that you don't tape too close to the top because when you're done sometimes it doesn't fit together quite right so you want to make sure you have enough room if you need to adjust now the next two pieces is you want to put ones of the smallest ones on one side and the other smallest piece on the other side each side has to be symmetrical because if you don't put them in to get together in the right order the hats not going to come out right so you have to make sure you're doing it in this order and then take that other small piece and attach it to the other side like that now for the two largest pieces which are the two lost you have to be careful about this make sure that the slants on this are going kind of in the mirror image again going opposite but then after that you just do what you've been doing the whole time taping on the back and then putting together like this just like that just make sure that the slants are going the opposite direction these two last pieces are usually the most difficult to put together because everything is a little bit crowded because it's making the circular shape so it may be a little bit difficult in the video you can tell that I'm gonna have a little bit of trouble with it but it seemed pretty easy to work around but just keep taping to the back and then putting it together like that and if you have a gap at the top that's completely fine or if you have a little bit of tape left over there don't worry about it and if you do have any extra tape up there what you can do is just take some scissors and cut off the extra tape and don't worry about that gap at the top because that's gonna be covered up later now what you're gonna do is you're gonna take some cardboard make sure it's thin cardboard you can use anything you want as you can see here I use some Ritz cardboard so you can do anything you really want make about six tabs like that you you actually really only need four but um I'm just doing that in case I mess out so then take some tape you can bend it too it might make it easier and then put it in like that and just keep taping around the entire hat this is to make the Hat more sturdy and it also gives the Hat the round shape so that if you wear it it won't crumble or anything when you put it on and so just keep taping around the top and bottom make sure they're on there correctly make sure they won't fall off and you may notice you can see through the white hat to the cardboard but that's fine if you have your head actually colored in right now you um you probably can't even see it so it's fine now what you're gonna do is you're gonna make the brim for that so put the Hat down like that and you're gonna make kind of a half circle like this yeah and kind of draw it in lightly in case you mess up so you can erase it and there won't be any left over marks and once you have it right or how you like it just go around and darken it back in like that and then put the hat back on and you're just gonna make a half circle around the edges like this and by now which it look like a half moon and then just darken it in and then once you have it all darken in you're gonna cut it out with some scissors and this is when you can color the Birman if you want to now what we're gonna do is you're gonna take some pencil and you're gonna draw some lines like this these represent the seams of the brim so just draw it around like that you can also do these dotted lines here instead if you want but you can do it any way and just keep doing that but before you get to the very end about this point stop and just leave that area blank in there now you're gonna take some cardboard and you're gonna trace around the paper it's okay if the cardboard is a little bit too small as you can see here I have him used a little bit too small a piece but it's fine just make sure it's not too small and then you're gonna cut it out because this is gonna make the brim more stiff and then you're gonna take some glue glue the cardboard and then you're just gonna put the brim the paper broom onto the cardboard once you're done with that you can flip it over and if you have any writing like here and writing like that what you do is you trace around and then you cut that out and then you're just gonna put it over the words or whatever there is there so you don't see it and then put it down like that and if you can still see through you just do it again and then you won't be able to see it now what you're gonna do is you're gonna make sure that shape is the same shape you see on the Hat it has to be that shape because that's the front tape the brim put a few pieces on and tape it to the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on straight now you're gonna fill that gap in so take some paper cut out a square rectangular shape and you're gonna glue the inside of the Hat like this and then Pat that down inside and then you can't see through anymore like that now what you're gonna do is you're gonna make the airholes for that so take some paper and draw six circles and put dark dots in the middle of each one and then cut them out once you have them all cut out take some glue glue the bottom of them and paste them on in these areas on the Hat now we're gonna make the very top of the Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a strip about this big I actually think I made it a little bit too long take some glue glue the end and make a circle shape about this size and glue both ends together once you have that done take a piece of paper cut out a circle about this big take the other piece glue the bottom put that on top and then once you get that on glue the other side you might want to use a little bit more glue than I did here and then put that on the top right there now this is the point when you can put logos on here here here I used EC and a bunch of them but you can do anything you want and also you can go online print this sticker off glue the back and put it on the brim to give it a more realistic look and there you go there's your hat if you have any questions you can message me and I'll answer anything if you want you can also put your video of your hat as a video response to this I'd love to see it good luck ",

        "content": "hi in this video I'm going to show you how you can create an imaginative Easter bonnet with your child using simple paper mache techniques first of all you need a balloon if you're making something like this out of an egg shape or if you want to make an animal or a bird you'll need a small balloon for the head and a larger balloon for the body so first of all you need to inflate the large balloon sit it in a saucepan or bowl so it sits securely while you're applying the strips of newspaper I've cut mine into 1 by 5 inch strips but you don't have to be approximate that's only approximate you don't have to do it exactly the other thing you'll need is a pot of PVA glue which has some water in so it's running and you'll need a paintbrush and your meal apron that will cover your child because it can get messy so what I recommend is that you get your child to cover an area of the balloon with glue and I'll show you that it should just run on the balloon quite easily and then when you've covered an area the balloon in PVA close then apply strips running in the same direction all around the balloon then apply another another layer of glue put on the strip's going in the opposite direction overlapping slightly so there are no gaps and then your third layer will go back to the original direction and then I recommend that for the final layer you apply some kitchen towel strips or some paper to have strips and because this provides a really good base for painting it helps it make sure that the print doesn't show through or it provides a good base if you're wanting to put squares of tissue paper onto the balloon so after about 24 hours in a really warm place your balloon will hopefully dry so that it's it's it's very solid pop the balloon and cut up a circular hole in the bottom large enough for the top of the Hat it should should fit securely on and then if you're wanting to make an Easter basket like this all you have to do is is cut a section out of each side leaving a handle shape down the middle and then your child could fill it with things that they've made here I've got homemade daffodils and decoupage eggs and some tissue paper shred or if you're interested in making one of the animals then your your need and some tissue paper shred for their for their fur or for their coat now to help you to sit the head on top of the body what I recommend is that you have used some duct tape to make some crisscross shapes at the bottom of the head and stick that on top of the body so that it's secure because what you don't want is for the kids to fall off during the Easter bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you there were three kits available there's a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and there's a lamb kit and come with all materials that you'll need to make an Easter bonnet as well as the bonnet and a list of instructions to help you go through it step by step but if you have any questions or any ideas that you want to discuss please get in touch thank you for watching ",

        "category": "Arts and Entertainment",
        "content": "hello and welcome back to the insane knitters the YouTube video channel this is going to be a demonstration of a flat hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a lot of hats are knit in the round on a cable needle and they they're you know you just knit them in a circle and then you decrease to the top and you finish it that way a flat hat is knit on straight needles like this with just a large piece of fabric and a lot of people make hats this way it does involve some seaming and I'll show you that but what I'm using here is really big needles and really thick yarn this is called encore mega and on a size 15 needle it gives you two stitches per inch and that's just something I'm using right now and I'll tell you why it makes a quick it's a very quick knit just quick quick turn it up and it it's very thick and you only generally need one skein to do this you can use two it tells you on the label how many yards it is and it's this is sixty four yards on and I'm using a smaller needle than it calls for so I'm getting a little more yardage out of this to knit with but that's neither here nor there you can use any yarn you want for this I'm just using the thick yarn and the big needles too to show you because it's easier um when you want to make a flat hat uh like I said you is a thick skein of yarn to give me about two stitches per inch because it's it's a quick knit and I find it easier but you can do this with baby yarn you can do this with any yarn you want as long as you measure properly and that is really the thing you want to cast on enough stitches on your needles to make the length as high as you want the hat to be so if you need the Hat to be 10 inches high you know so you've got good six inches of coverage on your hat then you want to cast on enough stitches because this is going to be however however why it is is going to be how it sits on your head so and then you want to knit - however you however long you want it to be around generally the most average hat is the average person's head is about 20 to 22 inches you know the kids are obviously smaller than that and people come in different sizes so you just want to knit as long as you want your hat to be around and I'll show you why what I have done here is I've knit to the point to where I want to bind off okay I think this is about 12 inches so it's going to make a small hat and now I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go ahead and do that and I'll come back in a minute when I'm bound off and I'll show you what and we're back okay I have bound off this piece of fabric to the last stitch and I'll show you what to do now we've got our last stitch here and you want to finish that up no but you want it the thing is is we're going to seam this now so you want to instead of just cutting this off really close and binding it off that way you want to leave a long piece long piece of tail yarn here because we're going to use this piece to sew up the Hat so you want to leave really long tail to sew with so okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much okay and then we're gonna cut this and then we're gonna pull it through okay so there we go that's our last stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn through and we're gonna there we go now we're bound off completely here okay there we go now this is the piece of fabric that I knitted and what we're going to do is we're going to take a yarn needle if you don't have a yarn needle they come in various kinds this is a large one so because I'm using really big yarn here this is the piece I knitted okay here's the the cast on edge this is where I started knitting and then I knit it however long I want my hat to be generally this one's about 12 inches and but you know like I said normally you'd knit however long two to make it or whoever you're knitting it for measuring heads is kind of weird but you can do it just you know or you can take your best guess like I said the average hat the average size is about 20 to 22 inches depending on on the person you're knitting for so here's our our cast on edge this is where we started Inc this is our cast off edge where we stop knitting and this is what we're going to do we're going to sew the cast on edge to the cast-off edge the bind off and the bind on we're going to sew those together and you're going to end up with this two looking thing okay like that so you want to take your really long tail that you left you also can use another piece of yarn to do this you know just if you want you can use a different size of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I used to sew the Hat so that way it doesn't show if it gets pulled apart okay so here we are we have our yarn needle and our yarn and we're going to sew these edges together now you can see here where your yarn where you bound off right there and then you can see the edge over here so I generally oh and then that's another thing to see this pattern I just this is garter stitch it's just all knit stitches it's nice for hats it's thick it's comfortable but you can use any pattern you want you don't have to be you don't have to use garter stitch I know someone who does these in ribbing you can do it every pattern you want just remember that one side will be inside on the person's head and the other side will be on the outside so just keep that in mind with your pattern but this is just simple garter stitch it's all it's knit every row just because it works for demonstration purposes and also it helps me line up what I'm doing here so see there's I'm lining up the little rows there and now you just take your yarn needle and you pick up in between the bind off stitches there's these little ladders see those right in between each of these stitches you can go in and pick up that little that little ladder inside in it and that really helps you a lot when you're sewing and so what we're going to do is just seam all the way across or I'll show you a couple stitches how I do it there's lots of ways to do this but this is how I do it and so I just come over and I pick up the corner first just to secure that just to secure them together okay so now they're there they're secured they're sewn together and then I come in and I pick up both sides sorry I bump the camera pick up both sides of this stitch and both sides of this one and pull that through there we go that's sewn together this making a flat hat does make a big seam down the side and that can be uncomfortable for some people when they wear stuff but it's just a side effect of what this pattern you know of making a flat hat so and then that's it I just go back and forth I cut this is called kind of a whip stitch you just go back and forth and sew it up all the way up up the sides and you want to make sure that you get just about every stitch so that way you don't have big holes when you when the person puts this hat on so see I'm picking up both legs of this stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm just coming through just like this okay and you see how that's being seamed together there it's making this little making this little line down there down the Knitting I'll show you what to do with that in a minute so there we go see that's another reason I like to use the same color of yarn because this way it doesn't show very very much see when you can tell there's a scene there but you can't really see where the yarn is because I use the same yarn now if I used a different color you could really see so pick up both legs of that stitch and both legs of the next one and come come through and I will see you in a minute when I get this seemed up in Italy okay I'm back I've got this all seem down the side now okay so now I have this tube see this tube thing it's a it's like a it's a tube okay and it's not a hat yet but it will be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last stitch here just like that this is a little tail where we started to knit remember now this is the part where you make your hat okay you're going to basically stitch up one of the one of the sides here and that's going to close one end of the tube and kind of make a little hat shape like this okay like that so it doesn't look like a hat now but when I get this all sewn and I pull it really tight it'll make a little hat like that and you said you know it's not the prettiest thing in the world but it does work very well and then you can fold this up and and you have a hat for whomever you're making it for this is the part where their head goes in there you go you can fold that up and there's the top of the hat so that's how you make a flat hat so let's go I'll come back just a minute when I get this top zone and it's over the top you're going to instead of going back and forth like we did with this loose with the whip stitching you're kind of going to do the same thing only you do it on both sides so there's where I came out so I'm going to go in here like that pick up that because this is a different edge so it's going to look a little a little different because this is a side now instead of the bind off edge so you're going to go so you came out here and then you're going to go back on this side and over here like that you make in kind of a criss cross one two three four instead of going back and forth like that so you just go just like this and I'll see you in just a second when I get this done okay I've reached the last stitch now and these these are all stitched and I went back and forth back and forth and now I'm at the last stitch I'm going to pull it through and you didn't you don't want to seen this too tightly because this is what you're going to do now now you're gonna pull see you pull that really tight like that and see how it squishes like that okay you pull it really tight and then what I do is I take my needle and I just kind of wedge it through again just just because guess that little gives it a little extra tightening okay just like that and you can do it again if you want just to use up some of the slack on your on your needle there or some of the extra yarn okay there you go and you know one more time why not we're here so there you go you pull it tight now you weave in your ends there's an end and then you pull it inside out and there you go you have a hat here just a flat hat tada you made a hat yay Congrats here's your flat head with your ins bulb in and there's the broom you can roll it up or they can just wear it straight they want but there it is and that's what the top looks like like I said it's not the prettiest thing in the world but it's good it's functional and you can use whatever pattern you want and in it however you like there you go but ",
