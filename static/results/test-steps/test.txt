So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.

That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description.

And we are going to be using some, but not all of this fat in the actual spaghetti carbonara. Another thing you can do is just take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs. Quickly whisk that in. We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end. I put just about a quarter cup in here. Our bacon is almost rendered, so now we'll drop our spaghetti. We'll try to do that twisty thing. Kind of worked. Just get a little bit of water up on it. Let that roll. Check it on the bacon. I turned the heat down in the end. Be careful not to overcook this. Looks pretty much perfect. First, I'm going to take some out for garnish. Drain it on a paper towel. Now I'm turning off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so. And then just set that back over there.
