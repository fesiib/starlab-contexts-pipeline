                "content": "can a cardiac patient diabetic or even just a person who wishes to lose some weight enjoy the very best recipes in the world such as good Italian spaghetti bolognaise and for busy working people can make in the recipe be actually quick and easy the answer is yes to both questions this video clip means to illustrate how this video will be a little different from what you expect we will concentrate less on how to chop onions or stir the sauce with a spoon and more on nutrition and on making a healthy spaghetti bolognese recipe so what do we need first and foremost we will need some nutrition and health guidelines from reputable sources these sources could be the American Diabetes Association about the American Heart Association of the Mayo Clinic the united states department of agriculture and the National Institutes of Health or the American Medical Association we will also need some wholesome ingredients the major health institutions recommend that we use ingredients there are low in saturated fats and free of trans fats then we use unrefined complex sources or carbohydrates that we use lean sources of protein and that we include lots of fiber rich non-starchy vegetables we will also need some very special tools for example in the hard care version of the recipe we will use an oil sprayer in order to keep the total fat content low in all the three versions we use some kind of software to monitor the nutritional content and to either perform some meal or some menu planning so let's cook some good spaghetti now why not start by making a delicious tasty and yummy we will do that by doing some flavor extraction first use the oil sprayer and spray a very fine mist of oil at the bottom of the pot the recipe calls for a mix of fifty percent canola oil and fifty percent extra virgin olive oil sprinkle one half of the garlic flakes and half of the spices over the pint the thin oily coating spray again just a very fine mist of oil over the condiments heat or warm very gently for a few seconds mmm it already starts to smell yummy let's finally chopped or die some onion and spread it at the bottom of the pot spray again with tiny coat of oil for a half a second the warming oil will absorb some of the aromatic molecules that are responsible for the flavor what's now chopped as tikka celery and repeat the process we spread the chopped celery over the onions and we spray again with a very fine mist of oil for about a half a second chop some green pepper and repeat the process spread over the celery and spray for a half a second add some chopped carrots cover and heat gently until the veggies are starting to be just a little softer rule that starts to smell real good now by the way you can do this also using a microwave oven provided of course you're using the proper microwave vessel the veggies will be just a little crunch here time now to mix the slightly cook veggies with some wholesome ingredients let's dye some fresh Italian tomatoes and add them in the pot instead of using canned tomatoes which generally have added salt in them let's mix with either ground soy red kidney beans or extra lean ground beef depending on the recipe version that you have chosen add some tomato sauce one that contains no added salt and or some fat-free tomato soup reduced in sodium add the balance of the spices and condiments heat gently and stir occasionally until cooked to your liking serve over whole wheat or whole grain pasta cooked al dente and enjoy you will be asking well what about the additional content and the health benefits for me let's explain that the benefits of optimized care that is medical treatment plus lifestyle changes and optimized nutrition are so important that they cannot be ignored for example a major five-year follow-up study of heart patients found that people who resorted to optimized care had an infarction rate that was close to only one-fifth of that of the other participants in the study comparable and equally large substantial benefits can also be enjoyed by diabetics and by weight conscious people you have noticed that in the heart care version the recipe calls for ground soy for protein synthesis it has the same amino acids as beef the amount of oil used is minimal we end up with a heart-healthy spaghetti bolognese recipe which is very low in fat and cholesterol free and the diabetes care version some red kidney beans are used and the emphasis spurred on using whole wheat pasta so as to slow down the absorption of glucose and reduce blood sugar Peaks we now have a diabetic friendly Italian spaghetti bolognaise in the weight control and maintenance version the fat content is kept low a fraction of the pastor is replaced by non-starchy vegetables high in fiber so as to procure a feeling of society we now have meal which is balanced and low-calorie itchin readers are encouraged to speak to their doctor or dietitian regarding their own nutritional requirements with their help you will be able to determine what your goals should be regarding the intake of the four main groups of nutrients such as total fat and saturated fat goals the types of carbohydrates and proper amounts that you should have the sources of protein that are best suited for you and your intake of fruits and vegetables once these goals have been determined enter the spaghetti bolognaise ingredients and the amounts in your software click and go to the nutritional analysis panel on the right hand side of your screen you will see immediately if and what changes need to be made once you have optimized your spaghetti bolognese recipe to suit your needs save it into your personal cookbook all you will have to do in the future will be to drag and drop the recipe and your weekly meal plan or menu and you'll get a complete instant nutritional analysis of your whole weekly menu the end result will of course be an optimized nutrition plan which is custom tailored to suit your very own needs and goals one plan which is very good for you do not be shy about discussing your rep demise plan with either your doctor or dietitian you'll find that
