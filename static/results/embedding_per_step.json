Once your mushrooms are all stuffed, you just wanna sprinkle the top of each one with a couple pinches of bread crumbs. Just to make sure you get a nice little toasty brown top and add a little bit of crunch. And if you did wanna make these ahead of time, you could just refrigerate them for up to hour and then bake them whenever you're ready for some hot stuffed mushrooms. So I'm gonna put these in a preheated 400 degree oven and bake 'em for 20 to 25 minutes, until the mushrooms are nice and soft and kind of shrively and the tops are brown and toasty and everything inside is all melty and yummy and gooey."
