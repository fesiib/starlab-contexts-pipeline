I am in Arizona things dries super fast I mean the floor is drawing crazy crazy fast I did have to go over it on the dry mode to get it like this and to avoid like spotting like that I'm drying that area because that is going to leave that weird watermark on the floor okay so I was just rinsing this out this is the dirty side wall I'm making the new solution and I realize that this little gas key in here which suctions it to the bottom piece here completes that essential suction and to pull up the dirty water came out so this little gasket a rubber piece right here so be really really really careful when you are rinsing this out and I do recommend rinsing it out so it doesn't get super grimy even though this is the dirty part once this gets clogged up and then there's like that little filter in there so you don't have any big particles going through but by the way if I forgot to mention before I did vacuum and use like a microfiber sweeper on the floor to make sure I didn't have any large particles to clog this outlet so I did really clean the floor beforehand and I wanted to share that little tippet that this guy almost went down the drain that little tiny little rubber piece so there you have it for me it is a thumbs up it works for me it's doing what I wanted it to it's I'm a little tired because it does take a little while to go through this process but we're deep cleaning the floors it's not a quick like if you want to quick get a Swiffer like a little spot clean this is for like when I do it once a month or spring cleaning and things like that what I really want it to be cleanness so let me know what you guys think about this and the comments down below I will leave a link down there as well to the product that way you can find it I will try to find an affiliate one so that I can make a little Commission if you do decide to purchase it through that link it helps me out it facilitates me purchasing these gizmos and gadgets for my family so I really appreciate you using them thank you guys so much for watching if you do have any questions leave those down below and I'll see you guys in my next video bye ",

        "content": "I love the look of tile I'm joined today by Rick Munoz II he is the owner of brick Munoz II construction and contracting you and I have been friends for a while and I have to say when you and I get together and we talk about building products one of the things that we really like in a home is tile Emily and we're seeing more of it in different places we're seeing it not only on the floors but on countertops as well and you've installed a lot of time over years haven't you quite a few pieces of tile yes yeah now as far as tile you know I love the look of it but how do I keep it clean how do you specially in a kitchen how do you keep this surface clean tile is simple to keep clean you wash it it's fired it's hard it's a very clean sanitary surface tile is easy to keep clean so I don't have to do any special I can just mop it down with a mop wipe it down and the best thing you can do is towel dry it when you're done picking up the dirt that you moved around okay I know a lot of people are telling me in today's world they use these steamers perfect sanitary all it is is water backup so you can steam your tile now does it hurt your grout if you take a push broom or a broom and you and you sweep your grout does that hurt it at all well it doesn't hurt it but what you're doing by washing your floor is if you look at grout it's always lower than the tile right you wash the tile tiles real beautiful clean where did you push the dirt right into the low point and that's why a lot of times your grout is discolored well that leads me to that question you know in my home you know we cook in the kitchen we drop a lot of things we have tile and I love the look at the grout but over the years we have picked up stains there's different you know just gunk in it what are the methods that I could take this crowd and kind of bring it back to life are there ways that I could do that or am i stuck with the old dirty grout well in my years of experience I found maybe five different options okay first option is the worst scenario cut the grout out take all this out take it all out huge expense absolute mess and very time-consuming okay you're probably going to want a professional to do that okay second method we have come across that we've used in a past - you can stain it okay so you actually paint it or stain this gras with a little artists brush you're staining it yes the next one would be using a latex product again using an artist brush latex is a paint and through the course of time we have found that it will pee a lot and then there's another one we buy in commercial places that we deal with it is called an epoxy okay again paintbrush artist paintbrush your breathing terrible carcinogenic fumes it's very caustic okay and it's two three weeks on your hands and knees painting that tile that's why tile installers don't want to do that now you've done this before what do you use what can what can I use to make this a lot easier simple project there's an acrylic resin okay this is an acrylic resin so it doesn't bond to the tile it will bind to the grout okay and I show you how to do it sure I'd love to take you through the process with any kit that one blue bottle there is a deep cleaner you dilute it put it in your own squirter bottle okay and just spray the tile one of the things I like mad about this is everything's water-based biodegradable okay will not hurt you got it they call this their deep cleaner and what this is doing is taking any oil any soap off of that grout joint and opening the pores for that resin to bond once you spray it let it set two to three minutes lightly scrub brush it dry it with a towel you're ready to apply your product okay and what's the product you can earn any color with this to any color okay any color we'll go over it doesn't matter so you can match your color you're gonna put a fine line at the product get it on the tile remember the other ones you can't do that okay take the brush and all do this stuff comes in their kit with them oh you just so you are painting it on right but you don't have to be so cautious okay so I can just rub that in along the grout line like right ahead just like that okay as long as you do it out of area that you okay alright so that's a mess now what do I do damp chamois lightly wipe over it you're done so I put this on now what happens if I have this on my countertop so it you know and I spill something on this is it gonna hold bacteria and dirt and grime forever I'm glad you asked me that this grout joint was done on this tile board okay that's soy sauce no I hate when I have to that stuff oh this is red wine I think you know that both of those stayin anything they touch okay you could rub this in all day all right it'd just be so I can just wipe this off like that Oh get out that is so cool so this is one way that you can change your grout into a new looking grout without doing all that digging I've done that before I've actually tried to dig out grout before and it takes forever so this is one method that you could use to change out your grout system it's a method I use with my company and it works but can I do it absolutely so do yourself we can do this product that's awesome now you said that this will last forever well but what a nice crach it is it durable you can't scratch it or you wanted it once it's cured it sets in 20 minutes after you put it on and you walk across your floor okay from the instructions they recommend that you don't wash your floor for 36 hours you don't take a shower if you used it in a shower for 36 hours that's when it completely cures I was gonna ask you real quick can I use this in a bathroom application can I do tile and have bathroom with this so I've had mold and mildew you know those black dots that I try to scrub out with bleach you're glad you brought that up because every one of these color seal this is not out of color agent it is a color agent and a sealer built into one okay but it also contains a constantly acting mildew side oh so it's gonna kill mildew that's already there that's right the deep cleaner will kill the mildew the product will never let the mildew grow bit back oh that's fantastic kitchen counters how many people have ceramic tile on your kitchen counter a lot of people wife sets our spoon down you out well it's porous it's gonna hold the germs in the bacteria it's gonna grow in there set your spoon down now bring it to your kitchen table set it down and what did you do mom transfer germs not-knowing fantastic but with the milled aside in this product it won't allow mold mildew or germs or bacteria to grow okay so just to recap when you have tile like this the best way to clean it you can sweep it off you can use a steamer you could just wipe it down you're saying with a sponge mop or something to get it clean if you do have grout that is damaged there are products that you can do if you want to take some time consuming you can change how your drop by cutting it out but some of the that are available for do yourselfers can save time and money absolutely and it's going to last a lifetime absolutely so why wouldn't you want to do something like that it just seems like it makes sense and I've done plenty of these products and I hate doing it I understand it for a homeowner pennies on the dollar you have a brand new floor for life okay sounds great it's very affordable Rickman oszi thanks for joining me today I think I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna try to change out my grout and it looks so dirty and you're saying I can fix it I didn't I'm not saying I know you could fix it okay well you're quite the guy thank you I think you so much as was it being here all right let me clean this off a little bit ",
