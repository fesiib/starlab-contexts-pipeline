        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "right quick intro about how I got rid of how I found I guess and got rid of a wasp mast it was a day before we were going on vacation for a couple of weeks so we called up said she found a wasp in the clubhouse gonna come kill it I did five minutes later she calls me and again says of another wasp in there so I came in and killed that one and while I was killing now when I found another one so I'm thinking okay three wasps that's gotta mean something so I scoured around inside found nothing looked on the outside sure I found about a one-inch hole and a whole bunch of wasps going in and out so I proceeded to try and get rid of that nest that a little google and what was the best way to do it found some guys used a vacuum it seemed like a good idea so yeah that's what I did and I glad I found it before we came back from holidays would have been a full-blown nest and you know the kids would have been in here maybe playing or something and riled them up and because you can't see the nest next thing you know you're surrounded by a hundred watts so especially if they were getting on the inside so anyway that's what I did hope it helps Joe so there is a wasp nest right in the corner of the singer focuses so we got up in that corner there and I got it I sprayed them already once but that stuff only works on contact I'll show you in a minute and it filled the hole but it evaporates very quickly so I'm gonna go get some other stuff that doesn't evaporate as quickly and we're gonna do a night raid see them this one I used it's pretty good nice and foamy as soon as it touches them they're dead they just drop you know but we're gonna get some raid Max is just stuff evaporates real quick it's okay if the nest is exposed but if you guys spray into a little milk and cranny where you can't actually get to this nest I need an applicator tip and stuff that doesn't do vApp rate so quickly whittle down my opponents so they can survive this hoes trip going to them really affected when they slide and they're crawling they can kind of get past it which I'm flying into the wall hopefully it'll suck it right out of that box of play anyone that tries to go through the hole in or out kind of interesting how they come in weasel now there's nothing suddenly a bunch will show up there's a lot of watts literally simmer down a little bit get most of them [Music] and here getting sucked in even when you once they're coming out of again [Music] like the traveling and all coming back now [Music] make sure they're not getting bored out the back of the abacus I don't have any water I know they gave you one guy did water that's a great idea [Music] that you're wondering about my vantage spot [Music] like I thought for a while okay phone battery dies this is the one I was using first I think this one actually phones better and the phone lasts longer this is the one I'm going to use again today there was a reason why neither of them are actually working that's because I finally had to get destructive and that's the baby right there so that's pretty big oh it's eight pushing ten inches wide that's pretty big and so there's no way I could actually get into these things to spray them because right over here let's take the panel off glad I did I mean I had to block right just right with the tip of that tape is and even if I put a board up there still getting him behind so I was thinking no I could do a board I was gonna use pink but that's all I needed just a little got to get in there and then I sprayed but all it did is soaked this area and I didn't actually get to the nest in the wild and now you know why so I'm gonna spray the nest it should be empty there's still a couple in there and yeah that's I'm gonna do so I've sucked up pretty much all the wasps I can get to you there's still gonna be a few in there protential ii so that's uh what are we looking at here at seven inches seven inches by say about five or six inches that's pretty foamy so we're gonna let that soak in all right so they sprayed them here we got some dripping happening this max is not so good I'd have to say it's still nice and foamy nothing pretty good I don't know the other ones seem to kill him better it seemed they crawled around a little bit we even had an escapee on one of them who came out poor escapees is still heard [Music] that's the bottom end of the nest it's hard to see very now you know I did kill them you can see the larvae and the babies in there so this nest was going to be where we go back it would have been a full-blown full-blown nest would have been huge in there they'll all be would have hatched so [Music] and look at this who you got sitting here you're not amazing well done Zoe so how early were there for the night to get the odd straggler coming in checking it out kind of interesting how they go toward the hole so what's this guy gonna do is he's landing yeah he's touching it so he did touch it he did land on the nest oh that's good I guess it's interesting how they go toward the hole though where they come into the box and not right to the nest and so he's uh he's just sitting off there licking his wounds I guess I don't know I got like seconds left of the battery so but he did touch the nest and the phone just briefly with his legs so I know how much it takes to kill these things but I doused this nest so it's good and soaked and I stuck the injector into the nest and sip dirt several spots so we shouldn't have anywhere that's drier chemical-free oh there he went right into the nest he landed on it Ares into the phone be kind of a weird he kind of flew right into it so it's already affecting him so I think chemicals are killing him that does it ",

        "content": "this video we're gonna take care of a wasp's nest this nest is actually about five meters from the ground so it is very high or I shall point out if you ever tried to get rid of an s like this it is very dangerous especially if you're gonna use a ladder for that reason we're gonna make a pole which can deliver the toxic poison through the hole to the wasps which will eradicate all the wasps in the nest if you not want to present you what you do in it's a good idea to get the professionals in to take care of the nest for you so as you can see that's the nest and it's not though on the ease so it is very difficult to get to you can see by the amount of wasp going in and out of this hall that there is a lot of activity in the nest and if you're not turning up the volume on your computer listen to this noise this is the noise you can actually hear from within the bathroom to get rid of the wasps I'm going to use wast killer powder is the partly sunny bit was about seven pounds delivered this will treat quite a lot of nests you do not need to use a full container no I'm late it'll it off go to the wasps nest squirt that in obviously in this case we can't because it is four meters maybe five meters from the ground obviously you do not want to be doing this type of job after my ladder it is very dangerous it is anything about this that you do not comfortable with or you don't like wasps and you think this job may be too big for you it is a good idea to get a professional wasp killing firm in they normally charge about forty five pounds to get rid of a wasp's nest they don't have to take it away they just use a similar kind of power to this which actually kills all the wasps so I have a plastic tube here which is about three meters long so I'm going to use that that's just a piece that they have lying around in the garbage I'm going to use this piece of copper pipe we're going to fix that to the top of there and then we're going to pipe this up using some eight millimeter plastic tube that will connect onto the fire extinguisher will charge your using the compressor now a lot of people don't actually have a compressor or an empty fire extinguisher so there are other things that you could use you could use a vacuum cleaner that blows to provide the air or you could use an air dryer even you couldn't use virtually anything so we're going to make this up and we're gonna test it using some flour so this tube will be filled with the flour and then when we do the copper killing we will use the wasp kill oak powder so our first step is to drill a hole in here and then I'm going to feed the plastic tube down to the bottom and the extinguisher will be at the bottom so we're going to put a gutter tip on this job obviously so the first thing is to drill a hole through this tube this piece of tube is approximately 10 millimeters and that should go nicely through the hall into the wasps nest and I threw it Maj in that there will be quite angry once this tube is poured anywhere near the hole that goes through the nest so I'm going to put that about there now I'm going to drill a hole further down for the two to exit so I'm simply going to feed this down there until that comes out at the bottom I can cut that off I'm going to cut that again and I will use a one-way valve that will prevent any of the power which is put in here from going down this pipe obviously you need to get this the correct way around so I'm just going to put some duct tape around the end there and that will stop any of their powder from falling out of there and I need to remove this nozzle and that is actually an eighth BSP fitting so I've actually got an eighth BSP fitting two eight millimeter tube so I could simply push that in there that's also charge this up I've created this pipe up to the compressor I'm going to connect that on to there and then I press down on the lever there and I will open the valve inside of there and that can then charge this up with some Confessor and unfortunately the gauges and actually working on this but we do have compressor in there now if we press down on the lever that should be just enough to squirt out some of the powder so that is now connected to the bottom of the tube and in the top we put the powder and then we're going to take it outside and test it so I'm going to use this full of place that in there and then I'll proceed to fill this up with some flour this is actually my third attempt at making this the first time I used a piece of copy tube instead of speedfit and I thought we'll get away with just taking that together using some guff et unfortunately that been word too well and the powder came out of the bike like this so what I made Mike - Mike - was a fire extinguisher with the terminal speed fit pay bots I think was that much pressure in it that you actually got kickback and the powder went everywhere sort of is a danger that if you use that much pressure you could actually blow the wasps nest apart and all the wasps could escape into the loft space so this is now what Mike to me and I've take the fire extinguisher to the Ender that has been pressurized using the compressor and we do not have a lot of pressure in there it's no idea what you will get in an iron wall the fire extinguisher and then there we have it Victor that restricts the going from the bottle to the exit tube at the top so I using that I can actually reduce the amount of pressure that's coming out of the end of the tube that point there is a piece of 10 millimeter speed fix and what I've done those I've used a 10 mil - 8 millimeter reducer so to get the power in the tube I'm using an old silicone bottle and then a funnel so we're going to tear this outside now I'm going to give it one last test I'm not going to fill this tubac with the wasp killer powder but before I do that putting on some disposable gloves and I'm also going to put on a respirator it's good idea to wear full protective clothing when you do this so I'm going to work some welders of roles welders gloves and the beekeepers hat just in case the last thing you want to do is get the wasps angry and get stunned several times by a lot of angry wasps nice it thank you for watching this video if you haven't done so already please subscribe to the channel ",

        "content": "good morning good morning to you good morning good morning to you good morning omani see you ah gimme kiss oh good morning guys hey wake enough were you crying in here hey hey hey hmm so good morning guys Jackson just woke up from his first nap and now that he's awake we have a lot of stuff to do up here we have to make James bed do you have some other laundry with the sheets and i also bought some new baby hangers yesterday while we're at target and i need to hang up all of jackson's clothes and also go through these clothes because a lot of these clothes probably don't fit him anymore and then kind of go through his closet and organize a little bit because here has his clothes of it right now I'm my bunny yeah that's Jackson's bunny you're your bunnies in the jump alene um some of these are still three months I'm not sure he'll ever wear these long sleeve three months cuz he's about out of three months and it's still too hot outside to wear long sleeve and then all up here our clothes that don't fit him anymore and I got the bin right here yesterday right now there's dirty sheets on it has new clothes in it right now but I'm going to put in Jackson's clothes that don't fit him anymore just kind of keep it for I don't know what maybe somebody has a maybe somebody's going to have another boy had no idea so that's what we're doing we're just going to hang out here I also have the vacuum up here kind of get some chores in today you guys do in I may I like the link to the Hat you're looking at everybody coming to your house look at Hanny you like this this makes me a nervous wreck he's up here um because she likes to climb up on that and I'm nervous that she's gonna fall over so i'm pretty sure um we're gonna have to get like a latch lock more mud dauber nest oh my word oh my word okay we have to go inside look Jane I'm not gonna get very close what in the world is that oh my gosh Jane that is a hornet's nest we're gonna have to go inside before the bee sting us okay let's hurry up come on come on river come on Hannie Hey yeah I guess come on hurry hurry who are you good to go in come on Hannah Hannah come anyways what I was gonna say was Jane knows how to unlock and lock these kind of doors and of course you knows how to do these kind of handles so I don't mind when she's out there when I'm out there but not when I'm not out there so it makes me a little bit nervous and so I think we're gonna have to do like a little latch lock up here so that she can't reach it and it'll always be locked and less we're with her look at a stable hey are you doing in here yeah alright well I God a few stuff done I'm so out of breath because I've been running around i'll tell you the story in just a second but I kind of made a bigger mess have diapers and trash here I got sheets that are finally dry and clean there that I still need to put on Jane's bed I have some clothes over there that I need to hang up for Jane but I basically got all the jacksons closet situated so that's all the clothes that fit them right now and some of them like I said are long sleeve there's a jacket here that obviously we're not going to use for a while but at least we have that all situated these are closed now that don't fit him anymore but I could possibly use for another boy or if a family member has a boy or something so yeah and then we have his little drawers here with some pants and shorts and jammies so he is all organized and situated but I'm going to tell you what just happened and why I'm so out of breath and I need to get Jackson though because it's time for him to eat so i'll tell you the story when i get him okay so like I was saying with the latch on the door and how Jane can unlock doors and stuff as I was up here Jane came and got her sunglasses put her sunglasses on and told me she wanted to go outside and I told her she had wait for me to go outside well like three minutes later I swear I did not hear the front door open but three minutes later I heard the door shut and so I came out and I said Jayne were you just outside and she said yeah I was like oh my gosh and also not only for her safety you know running out into the street or something I don't want my dogs to get out obviously and like start running around chasing people river doesn't even have a collar on right now so if he got lost we would never know and I don't know if Hannah even has her name tag thing on either so I asked her if the dogs went out she said Hannah went outside so I ran outside to see if Hannah was out there and we have like a little porch when you first got our front door there's a little porch and then there's another door so sometimes I signed Hannah out there you know just on the porch area and she's not like loose or anything so I was hoping that be the case but she wasn't there so like Jane are you sure that Hannah came out here she was like yeah so I went outside looked around called her name couldn't find her anywhere started running up and down the streets meanwhile Jackson's just randomly in the house by himself Jane's running around with me I'm calling her name whistling trying to get her to come to me you know she kind of has a mind of her own I don't think she'd ever run away on purpose but she definitely likes other people and will follow other people or you know try to jump on other people and get love from other people so I had no idea where she was how long she had been out there I ran around ran around rain around finally I was like well maybe Jane was confused and she didn't know Hannah got out so I was like let me go check one more time inside to make sure that both dogs are in there so I came back and came inside no Hannah river was in here so I ran back outside and I heard her collar like jingling around so I ran down the street and there she was like five houses down like sniffing someone's bushes so I grabbed her and brought her inside and it's not really her fault she's not like a bad dog or anything but oh so stressful so yes we definitely made some latches on these doors so that she did not get out and get run over herself or doesn't let the dogs out and they get lost forever I don't know that was just really really really stressful now i have a headache feeding jackson time for lunch and nap for these kids do what a snake it's a soccer ball don't mind the trash Jackson what is your sister doing what did you sister doing you guys look at this shirt we got this shirt Chris and I when we went to Hawaii when Jane was four months old and Jackson's

they're lost they're not bees but they need them out and they don't have anybody else to do it so this might turn into a comedy video but I'm like I'm fixing to try to tackle getting these wasps by this upstairs bathroom wall okay so we're no stairs bathroom about to do the deed sinks been removed and we're gonna draw it oh and stuff a bug bomb and the whole enforcer but max foger kind of there's an excitement laughs and you put pulling out and watch shoot out niche in the Vale that's what I got so we drill the hole and stuck the  and I realize the has to stand up to folk but it's working they're dropping on the ground outside so we're going to come on left side of that stud drill another hole here and she brought a headed upward angle oh I'm in stuff another can in this next wall cavity to cloggers later and they're still very active and I don't know if I'm making much headway mother crawling around on the ground out here then the lie about it he's nothing some big boys sounds are good eats longer better since I started feeling comparison to my family feel it even thus moans have long abdomens so they do some of much longer than others and I'm wondering if here I don't know what the difference is this hatched out or with that long abdomen I wouldn't think so some of them have a much longer optimum that one there's long with you that thing is almost a full inch long yeah about a dozen interior attacking minions thankfully this little thick let me not get through I got about three more kill for you in the door I still freaking hear me I just put our last bomb pretty close to where they're coming and goes there's one even big ones hanging on to that very top man it don't look like we've slowed them down and oh no it doesn't know around here there's a there they are for comparison sake that poison must be have a neurological effect on how these and in the room will make sure to came and pilot over then right here right here just appears on that ain't near baby the one mister here in activity I'll take that's like that the whole time gonna probably cut it Oh able to keep pageant really better do you want to get victim do if you got a Dubrow I'll bet that's all up in here you see any when you have innate homeless bears it's what it is it I think if we seal the wall up they're going down just for the poison it's in there I want a problem I can say is it whatever Laura was even a contract ants and roaches oh yeah it's an attractive to there we used three bug bombs inside the wall and a piece of a can of Bengal wash spray on outside and they're still coming and go but they have certainly slowed way way down and you can't really see them bixton with the trash on the ground but there's a couple hundred dead ones on the ground and I'm sure there's many more dead ones inside the wall but since they're still somewhat active we duct taped over the holes on the inside we're going to leave them overnight come back tomorrow and cut the wall open and get the nest out that was the end of the beginning of our first paper wasp hive removal back for day 2 this wasp remove this is Randy cutting out a wall where there's an infestation of Yellowjackets we put three bug bombs in it yesterday and he turned the light on so it messed the camera up but there still seems to be humming and buzzing inside the wall and these are giant Yellowjackets on the devon switch these are ones that are lying in the light receptacle that are dead from the bug bomb okay what you hear don't open the door I'm not going to know they're gonna be here we go and I know you don't like kids all of them I'm into I'm in here I'm in to look at walk missed my goodness we got all the eggs I've got top of that pie reads from down there we can spray them with its contact killer I'm gonna crank the shot back up and start moving because I don't when you flew out here I'm gonna mix up just enough 12 tearoom that's right nothing little of it there bit them to the wire as well I was sure nervous about getting of these things to begin with because they're they're more aggressive than a honey bee for sure but I hadn't been stung yet my bee suit is doing its job and keeping them out and I'll be on the bottoms jeans and boots I guess part of the reason they're staying off of them is there's a window here and a light here and then drawn to the light so they're trying to trying to get out of this bathroom they are trying to attack me somewhat but I had mints done yet so I'm gonna I'm fixin to cut the rest of this out of here and close this wall up and get a she can be the time of the stud day and I wouldn't be sunny mom down how we stopped playing spray do it now mmm-hmm oh hey I started taking the eggs apart and it started hitting me in the sleeves and getting through and then I'm fixing it in a shot back you can see the little larvae then around grad thread I guess that toward the captain's off the sails you see I'm trying to wiggle out on the right bottom I must head now I guess I did another some more go ahead make captain her squirm out all these little uncut Barbara wiggling around they're mad at me too well there's get a lot of them flying around pissed on there for 50 years list there's still enjoy all cleaned up pretty good that / matrons working on the Hansen that Drollet poise and they've got studs built to both sides where they attached another row of cone apparently that for me Thrones get that was it I thought it was going to be a full wall and it's half a five-gallon bucket and I got a wonderful hall yeah this one was enough that's it another government installation safe from the ravages of these terrible terrible insects ",

        "content": "hey Mike Withrow pest control here and do you have wasps around your home or business and you're looking for a way how to get rid of wasps well today's video I just want to give you five easy tips you can use for how to get rid of wasps so the first thing that you want to do is test yourself and make sure that you're not allergic to wasp so if you don't already know make sure you get yourself tested because it can be very dangerous a lot of times wasps they don't just sting on their own they attack in groups so it can be a very dangerous situation if you are allergic to that and again you know if you don't want to save yourself the hassle just go to a pest control professional like royal pest control and have those losses removed they'll be able to do a lot safer than you're trying to do it on your own so tip number two is get some protective gear so like I just said it can be very dangerous trying to remove wasps on your own so if you're going to do that I make sure you're wearing you know boots pants hooded sweatshirt safety goggles a scarf or something you can use to cover up your face work gloves because again wasps can be very aggressive and attacking groups and tip number three is to wait until night wasps are very active during the day and once becomes a night time they tend to go back in the colony stick in there so it's a lot easier to approach the nest and another benefit of that is if you're going to use pesticides or different techniques to get rid of the wasp they're all going to actually be in the hive for the most part in the evening so it's a better time to do it and again be careful when you're approaching at night as well because if you're using a flashlight that can actually attract the wasps to you so if you're going to be using light try and use a different color so maybe like a red light or amber light different things like that it's gonna be less attractive to those wasps another step tip number four is to act now so as soon as you start to see and notice the you notice the lost nest you want to act early on in the season after the wasps come out of hibernation in the winter they become more active it takes time to build up that colony so if you strike early you're gonna be able to have a smaller colony of smaller grouping of those lofts in it to my understanding it can grow up to thousands of wasps in the colony so the longer you wait the bigger it's gonna get and the more dangerous it can get and tip number five if you're using pesticides to get rid of those wasps wait at least 24 hours and make sure the area is clear so if you've got kids you've got pets make sure they're not in the area because a lot of the pesticides that they will use to take out those wasps can be pretty potent and pretty toxic pretty dangerous and you want to wait at least 24 hours and stay out of that area another thing make sure you clean up the debris from them soul mate parts of the nest dead loss that are leaning around because if your pets eat that after the pesticides have been used it can be poisonous to your pets as well so make sure you check over that area and get that stuff out of there so again five simple tips you can use for how to get rid of wasps and again it's probably best just to hit up a pest control professional service like Grove pest control to come in and get rid of those wasps for you and so the dangers of trying to do it on your own so but if you do choose to do it on your own definitely take advantage of these five different tips and again if you'd like to take advantage of a free consultation be sure to head over to rolled pest control.com and fill out the form there to set up your free pest control consultation but again appreciate everybody for tuning in and I will talk to you soon ",

Rankin star is very much opposed to having bees in the greenhouse and so we need to do something about it so a lot of the plants and things we have in here are strawberries and blueberries and starts are going to be food that are going to feed my family and the last thing I want to do is spray some unknown toxic chemical not only cut contaminating myself breathing it in but also coating all of our food I don't you know when we look at current cancer rates and health issues that have been are still unexplained by medicine modern medicine I don't think you have to have a PhD to understand that something in the environment is causing these increased rates of cancer so I think by limiting ourselves to the because being exposed not only our food but our but our persons in general to toxic chemicals is only only goes it's only reasonable these things have an effect on us and I don't think they're fully understood and known so what do we do about it I'll show you a recipe for an add more of a more natural spray that we can get rid of rid of wasps that are going to be safer to use especially around our food and so all you need is a as a spray bottle just a regular spray bottle and fill it up with water and about a quarter to a half a cup of dishwasher detergent just the liquid form just the type you like dawn would be a good example and then we'll add about 20 drops of pure cinnamon extract so let's put that together and I think I've got a few flying around here and see how it works so as I said a quarter to a half a cup of detergent with just normal tap water and then the cinnamon extract you can get at any health food store Trader Joe's this one there's lots of different places and so this one doesn't have a drop so I'm just gonna put a fair amount in here should be enough now the soap neutralizes those the wasps and the cinnamon or the excuse me the peppermint extract a coating that is very unpleasant to them and will prevent them from coming back and building future nests all right we got mr. wasp right here give him a spray he didn't seem to like that there's another one yeah it definitely takes the fight out of them so there you have it the proof is in the pudding there's our little wasp trophy count and the peppermint oil seen in the soap combination works really good and what do you have here a few pennies for this mix versus this stuff here which is expensive you know I've seen this stuff like seven eight dollars a can not to mention how toxic it is that if it kills biologics mall biology I like these bees what do you think it's gonna do to us you know it's not good for you so that's the tip from the homestead and we'll see you next video we keep wanting to come back and build nests up here so what I'll do is is all just coat this and the cinnamon oil will prevent the little bugger instructions I'm gonna get back in there and discouraging them from building their nest thing go somewhere else [Music] ",

        "content": "for the first time ever I'm recording a video outside at night now why am i doing that because nighttime is the best time to kill wasps this video is made possible by wiki by wiki by is a free chrome plug-in that automatically tells you if you're getting the best prices when you shop at hundreds of online stores including amazon.com Amazon isn't always the low price leader that it once was so install wiki by today and make sure you're always getting the best prices just go to handy dad TV slash WB or click here to get this free chrome plug-in that's right I said free Thank You wiki bye welcome to handy dad TV I'm Chris Hyder your virtual data in the cloud and today we are going to take care of an underground wasp's nest not just any wasps pacifically Yellow Jackets which are notoriously evil to human beings and also my pets because just a couple of days ago they attacked one of my dogs just for getting too close to the bush where the nest is located not in the bush under the bush yeah that's right it's an underground net all you see this little hole in the ground and the Yellow Jackets just keep going in and out like it's an airport all day long so after my dog got stung by about three bees I made a barricade so they wouldn't go anywhere near the bush and you know it's time it's I got to take care of this it's just not right so I did a little research and not only did I find out that it's best to take care of these things at night but the best product to use is something called dry on dust and to apply it you use a bulb I don't know what you want to call it but you put the the dust in here and you squeeze it into the opening that's why we're doing this at night because they're all asleep in their bed and we're going to sneak attack so I've never used this stuff before but I did a little research online and it seems pretty easy to do and hey there's a first time for everything so what I'm going to do is take the dust and and put in about three ounces of it in here and then put the little tip on which has a couple of extenders and a fine point here stick this in the hole and blow the dust down in there and now you can't really use this kind of a thing which is a wasp and Hornet spray with an underground nest because there's a lot of chambers under there from what I understand and I have never seen it but there's a lot of chambers and you spray this in the hole you're just going to piss them off but you're not going to do anything to kill them so the dust however goes down and just fills all the caverns under there when you squirt it under and they get completely covered this penetrates their exoskeleton and just makes them lethargic and eventually dehydrates them that's really what it does so this is a one pound container I got this online and I got the bulb duster with it so I'm just going to put some dust here in the bulb [Applause] I don't know how much three ounces is but I think that's pretty good and put the top back on it and I'd say we are ready to go let's go kill some Yellowjackets so earlier today I put a GoPro on the end of a long stick and stuck it down by the bush so that I could monitor the bees coming in and out and now I have a light down there and I knew they'd be in their nest in the dark and I've got my little GoPro app on my phone here and I can see that there's no activity so there's sleeping quietly I'm going to move my barricade away and we're going to take care of these things okay this is the bush where the hole is for the nest underground and you can see the remnants of some dust there that was some seven dust that I tried to get rid of them with by just putting it in the hole thinking that they have to go through it but they don't they fly right around it but this time should be different all right so I'm going to use this little light right here my heart is racing I've never done this before I'm trying to see where the hole is and I really can't tell when I see the hole I don't know how deep it is though or what direction it goes in and I want to make sure I get a direct hit why do you little tests they certainly did a good job I can't see through the bush it's too thick Wow all right here goes nothing now I'm just going to cover it up the best I can and I didn't see any activity I don't know if they have another exit somewhere but I'm hoping we're looking at a grave let's hope otherwise I'll be back doing this again tomorrow night now while I'm at it and I've got the bulb out I've seen wasps go in and out up here too so I don't know how effective this is going to be but I'm going to give it a try anyway so well that didn't work I think I hear some buzzing up there but I put too much pressure on this because I'm trying to get it to go up I hear them buzzing it's the freakiest thing it's the freakiest thing okay he came out he's not happy he is not happy all right I got to call this a night plan a different course of attack day to the next day I found no movement from that underground nest and I found no less than a dozen dead wasps all over my patio so even though I didn't think I had enough dust in the duster I had enough to do the job they sleep this dust also works well with cicada killer wasps now what they are trying to get a shot on the flipping gig these tunnels cover right here there's a hole right there and they find cicadas and they sting them and drag them down to the hole in line egg then they bury them up and they come back the following year on just spraying some dust in these holes and covering it up and they won't come back and if they do they will not survive it but if you can get the bees which I think I've killed off all the ones I've seen around here and if you wait till the bees land and hit him with a shot of dust they may only survive another 3 or 5 minutes and fall in ground beautiful thing cicada killer wasps aren't aggressive to humans but they are a nuisance digging all those holes and leaving dirt mounds in the lawn and most people can't tell whether a wasp is aggressive or not they just freak out and run I personally have nothing against any wasp I just want them to nest

        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "hi everybody welcome to part two on how to safely and scientifically kill a European wasps nest just using materials from your local supermarket specifically dog flea treatment and cat food that's what we're going to be using to attract and killer wasps in the previous video I gave you some details around some myths around how not to deal with wasps and what processes do and don't work and some good scientific literature research there and some link to that research that you can read it for yourself in one of those documents for the previous video there were some things some information there from wine Tasmania on how to build a boss baking station and we'll go through that today and also some easy alternatives what I'll also do is give some detail around the timing when we need to kill the wasps and the process around which to do that so the first thing we should really talk about is timing because there's no point killing wasps when you first see them come into your garden I'll come to your barbecue what we need to do is dose up the the wasp nest with enough poison to kill it effectively and we're talking about quite large numbers of wasps here I mentioned around 3,000 wasps in the nest and that's quite typical at the height of summer so what we want to do is use that back against the wasps so the timing in the southern hemisphere is around January enormous fear around July that's when the wasps are at sufficient numbers and they're growing and building and feeding the larvae in their nests that's the time when they're coming out to look for a protein sauce to feed their larvae and that's when we can use that against them and to kill them so that's we want to be doing it not necessarily at the start of summer that if the whilst numbers are too low we won't get enough poison into them to kill them you can still try of course but what we want to do is attract them and get them in one go so let's talk about baking stations so the first thing is we want to have a safe place to put our poison but we don't poison the wasps straight away the first thing you want to do is actually attract the wasps to our bait and then when the wasps know where the bait is until the other wasps in the nest where to go then we'll swap it out for our poison bait so it's a two-part process that's very important we're going to lure and then we're going to kill them okay so to do that we have baking station now in the previous video I talked about a wine Tasmania design for baking station and I bought the link there for it and I have built one myself this is what it looks like it's two tin cans IVs a coat hanger makes an easy hook and a piece of wire to join the cans together and in the base here is a place for the wasps to get in and out of and for our bait to go this is designed to be nice and solid today I'm gonna farm somewhere and to keep the bait nice and dry and give easy access to change through the bait from a luring bank to a Poisson debate now this works fine but I would say that's not the easiest thing for all of us to build at home so I'm gonna give you a couple of alternatives to that you can still do one of these if this is what you want but I think it's a little bit more complicated so we'll look at some alternatives so the first alternative is a really easy one it's to actually use one of these flytrap wasp traps now I mentioned before we not trapping the wasp we want the boss to get in and out this is basically the same as our other one it's easy to hang up it'll keep the baked dry you can easily change the base over but what we don't want is for the wasps to coming through the holes and get stuck in here we actually want them to come in and be lured to our bait go back to the hive tell my boss to come in so all we need to do is simply get a a sharp knife and cut some holes in the side of one of these and that will be perfect if you can get your hot on your hands on one of those that's all you need to do just cut holes in the side and let the wasps in and out it doesn t be any more comic-con than that because what we're going to be doing is in a small saucer we're going to be putting some about cat food into the base there I will just use the cap off a soft drink bottle for example that's all we need put the bank into that the cap into that put the lid on and hang it up in a tree with a nice big hole company piles on the side at least half an inch so 12 millimeters minimum diameter for the holes too low the wasps easy entry and exit let me put that up in the tree and the wasp will come and find that and they will that's a perfectly good option for a trap and I'll turn it if you can't get hold of one of those is to use something like a yogurt container it's got a lead the baking going easy access keeps it dry all we need to do is cut some holes to allow us to hang it up and I'll just do that right now okay so I'm going to make a European wasp baking station out of a yogurt container very complicated first thing I want to do is to cut some holes on the side to let our Boston just gonna do one to cut that across county so easy these at home you can do this yourself okay let me just repeat that on the other side okay so this impulse Pro wasps are coming you know you just need some holes to hang it up and I think the easiest way to do it is just to a couple of little triangles at the top here I'm just getting a small triangle triangle there another one opposite side need something be careful three okay so that's that what I'm going to use is the hang that I cut before for the the team can budding station this is just a coat hanger with me just bent over as you can see that will simply book on travel onto our holes very straightforward you know guys spending shake make sure it fits just bend it in like that and then guess it was potting station the bacon go in the lead can go on and put that in the tree and that will attract and help killer wasps so there's two three easy options of how to make baiting stations you can pick which one you find easy so I think the yogurt container is pretty effective because the the holes are pitted from the rain by the lip of the believe so is a really good one no ether poison and the wasps now the two-part process to this the first one is to lure the wasps to a bait whether whilst succumbing insufficient numbers we replace the bait with a poison bait and then that will kill them in the nest so it's quite straightforward but it does take a little bit of time now the one Tasmania Society give some good instructions on this and I put the link below the video and you can read about this in detail yourself so I'm not making this up again it's all based on scientific research we used to summarize what they said what you do is you have your base in this case I've got a tin of cat food which is a fish based cat food that this works quite effectively on wasps this can go into your bagging station and go in as is really doesn't necessarily need to be taken out pop it in and put the lid back on now this needs to go out for about three days in that time go out and observe the wasps and what you're looking for is at least 10 watts visiting the bait the baking station in a five minute period once you get that volume of wasps coming in is quite straightforward simply replace the bait with a poison one at that point you'll simply take the old bait out probably throw it away because it might be very nice and replace it with a new one so let's go over the poison again now this is tip Rennell the previous video we talked about the science behind why fipronil works and is also some literature there on the dosage thirty years so the dose to use is point one with grams per per litre this stuff comes in 100 grams per liter and for those who are signed a goodly basis of 1 in 1000 dilution in other words if you put 1 milliliter into one liter of water that would be a 1 in 1000 dilution so now cat food here is 85 grams now you can translate grand into mils for water so 85 grams is 85 mils of water so we do what we want one one thousandth of that need to be 85 microliters of water now what is a microphone isn't what does that 85 or a hundred doesn't it mean that accurate what is 100 microliters looks like well it's about one or two drops of poison one two drops of your fipronil flea treatment meets narrowly put it back in your bathing station put the lid back on then cure the wasps nest it really is that straightforward doesn't matter which other what with methods that you use they're all perfectly effective up to you this one's a nice easy one as you can see very neat and tidy the boss person can get it and get out I'll get to the meat and it's very cheap and effective just in the supermarket so good luck on killing your european whilst nests ",

so many so I was like oh there's not a lot is like cuz I've been down there recently but I hadn't looked up I mean so I jumped down there a squat down and I look up and there's a wasp nest seeing it has been how are you doing that's my sting let's see oh it's just tiny now how's it feeling you doing a lot better good I'm so glad so the kids are outside on the trampoline doing like putting the sprinkler under the trampoline and jumping on it in their swimsuits and I think they were having a great time and it's a lot of fun cuz it's really hot day but then they came running in and now they're not going out I was gonna vlog it but I was editing and so I was like okay as soon as I'm done editing I'll come out and blog it and then I didn't get done in time before a scary situation asked them the other day you know you saw the vlog goddang by a wasp I was like English man that so many under there cuz they were just falling under there so I was like oh there's not watch this like because I've been down there recently but I looked up I mean so I jumped down there a squat down and I look up and there's a wasp nest seems like I pop out run inside yeah yeah they all came running in and they were like no get a flamethrower even that's wooden and I think what dad gets home we'll try and figure out what he wants to do as far as getting rid of them well we should sneak in to stab to have them each individually alright so you guys saw yesterday had passed me got stung by a wasp well turns out we do actually have a wasp nest inside our parkour obstacle here why don't you just look at it from the over here oh there's one it's on this side it's right it's right there sit you have a reason to hate him and not on your head we could take that board off but then there get so angry there's no easy way to do that we think the board often next to it I don't know I don't have a good plan yet what I do know is we don't have any wall spray right now so you've definitely to get well spray first this is not gonna be fun what's going on over here we're standing on YouTube the best ways to kill a wasp or like I've lost mast oh that is what is driving them there's no way I'm doing this like you have to gear hand so close to it huh you can get out and this is tiny computer well we have uh 827 sources if you'd like that's his huge nest I'm sure in the daytime his big and oh it's like really big with a sprayer so we're gonna have to track a supply and get some washed foam the practice fly was closed so we are instead gonna hit up Walmart fast how you feeling about this wasp killing an expedition gonna be inside that's how I feel you're not gonna come out there and watch you don't want to film I need someone to get really close to the mass and film that's why we have the handy-dandy bill fro mount okay so I was really hoping to get some kind of phone and all they have of these two different kinds of sprays so they say our Hornets so I guess that's what I'll take but I wanted the foam next up let's set up GoPro yeah are you getting in the car are you gang in the car are you guys ready as we close the door you ready yep get it hey watch out don't get close J do

house and it's just like we're in a national forest here or we could literally we could go for hundreds of miles and be on public lands which is super fun so yeah it's uh yeah like there's a stream up here and all kinds of crazy rock formations and wildlife like deer elk bears I've seen all of those here at Fox I've seen here coyotes so it's kind of crazy but we walk about ten minutes from our house and we are in the National Forest so we're at the part of the trail where it goes down into this gully and there's a really cool stream at the bottom so the show like goes down here and you can see there's like a valley down here and Oh what black squirrel did you guys see it hey like bleep left hashtag parkour squirrel so guys we wanted to show you that stream because it's awesome but now
