        "content": "hi guys I'm Carly with artificial plants and trees at home and today we're going to do an unboxing of our seven and a half foot north valleys first tree this tree is by the National tree company and it comes packaged in a big brown box with a label on the top that says open this end the other side also says don't open this end so we're going to go ahead and unbox this tree and see what it looks like all right there are two flaps right on the front that easily open up and the tree is inside in a couple sections a couple large sections it looks like the first section is the topper of the tree it has a square pole coming down and it has hinged branches running the whole way up making this one easier to fluff then a tree that comes with separate branches that you have to attach individually this is a pre-lit tree so the LED lights are already attached comes with some assembly instructions this is the second section of the tree and this is the third section of the trail this tree is seven and a half feet tall it has three sections to complete it also the bottom of the box is the base for the tree this is your typical metal base it folds flat for storage which is really convenient when you can use a tree down a fan the difference and then the legs spin open like that and the tree attaches in the top and there is a pin that you can twist to tighten the tree once it's in place all right with these few pieces I think this tree is going to be easy to assemble let's get started alright I read the instruction book I have to say it's super easy to follow it has written instructions as well as picture instructions on how to assemble all their different types of trees it also talks about the lights and how to replace the lights if you ever need to for the pre lit trees so this is a nice easy to follow instruction book just start by opening the base kind of try to Center it on my wall a little bit here alright and we need to find the bottom section first which is going to be your largest of your three sections for me that is this one and when it comes there's a little cap on the end of the pole just pull that cap off it's just so you don't poke yourself with a pole when you're unpacking this tapered end is going to fit right down inside of our base and it's going to click right like that you can think these branches already here are already falling into place they are hinged so this is going to be a really easy treat to assemble with the bottom section in you're just going to twist that I pin until it's nice and secure I'm giving this a good shake right now and other than the branches coming down the tree is really solid I'm gonna change the camera view real quick so you can see the top of the street and we're gonna add the other two sections alright a lot of the bottom branches have already kind of fallen into place I am just gently tapping on them to have these top ones fall enough so I can see the section that I'm adding next and you can see how easily it is fall in place this is really slick the next one there's actually the top of the tubing from the bottom section is open here the next section is going to add in just like the last section did so we're going to pick the middle section which also features one of those caps on the end just take it off and you just lower that section right inside the tubing again we now have two of our three sections assembled we just have to put on the topper and it's going to go in the exact same way these two did I'm just giving me the gentle tug to have them fall into place so I'm ready to put my topper alright let's add our third and five alright we're going up a little bit higher at this third section the tubing comes straight up like it did for the other two so I'm just gonna grab this last piece that we have the 2 is a little bit different here it's a little bit more narrow and this section actually has a square base so we just have to fit that square base into that tubing like that and we have our three sections connected now each section has the end of a power cord this is the end looks like that and it comes from the base of the tree you're just gonna run this second section power cord through right up as close to the bridge all right I did want to show you one more thing you know quick the top of the middle section has a low connector that's loose and the bottom of the top section has the same little connector that's loose all you have to do to light this tree is connect those two sections then there's a little cap that you twist over it and then you have the same connectors that connect the middle section to the bottom section of the tree alright our next step is going to be fluffing this tree but before we did that I wanted to take just a second and show you what the tree looks like with absolutely no fluffing I have to say I have assembled and disassembled a lot of artificial Christmas trees and this is by far the easiest one I've ever had to do the next thing we're going to do is fluff the individual branches of this tree they're all kind of squished together from the packaging but fluffing them is really easy it's also included in the instruction booklet on how to do it but I'm gonna focus in on the bottom here and show you really close up how easy it is to fluff this tree right now I'm focused here on the bottom branch as you can see now can kind of compact from shipping but each of these PVC branches has a wire in the center that makes it super easy to fluff you're just going to kind of pull apart each individual stem of this first tree and the same would apply if you had a pine tree or any other type of artificial tree you're just spreading these apart real easily some go up some go right some go left it can be kind of haphazard because a drink tree grows kind of haphazard and I have to say the wire supporting these branches is really kind of nice and thick and pliable it will support even your heaviest Christmas tree ornaments really well that was easy it was to fluff one branch of this tree I'm just going to continue doing it with the rest I start on the bottom row work your whole way around the bottom row then go up to the next row and continue until you've already reached the top of the tree I'll show you one more while we're here it's real easy just pull the branches every which way kind of alternate do one to the right one to the left one up a couple down if you need to but the row below you if you're doing them up kind of it should take care of not having to do it down and once you do one or two of these they go superfast that's easy I'm going to continue doing the rest of the tree and I'm going to show you what this tree looks like fully fun hi guys we have now fully fluffed our Christmas tree and I have to say with so many branches it was really easy to fill this one in but one feature I didn't mention before when lighting it that I really want to highlight is that the top of the tree has one more outlet right at the top branch and that outlet is for a lighted tree one of the neatest features about this North Valley spruce is that it features dual colored lights that switch between white and multi-coloured this means you don't have to pick anymore which tree color or tree light color you want when you pick your artificial tree there's simply a foot pedal at the bottom of the electrical cord and there are nine settings for this light feature the first is the plain solid white the second is solid multi color the third is a white that brightens engines the fourth is a multi color that brightens and domes the fifth is the white and multi color that changes on a slope and revolt back and forth the next one is flashing white lights then we have flashing multicolored lights and then we have a faster interval of multi colored to white and then a even faster in a war interval of white to multi color and those are the light features on the seven and a half foot north valley spruce tree ",

        "content": "hiker from border concepts thank you for purchasing one of our trees today we're gonna be setting up at six and a half foot tree this process should take fifteen to twenty minutes and the only tool you'll need is a pair of household scissors today we're going to be assembling a six and a half foot tree but the same steps apply to the majority of the trees that we sell the only exception being nine foot trees and larger there are subtle differences and you need to pay attention to the instructions because they spell those differences out first step of course is to get it out of the box now on this step you want to be very careful cutting open the box and more importantly into contents in the box do not use a knife a mat knife or exacto blade please use a pair of scissors that way you don't damage your tree that you've just bought home so let's go ahead and just open up cut these bands off very carefully cut open all the tape that's holding your box closed and as you open it up you'll notice that your tree is wrapped up and that it's going to be in several sections and most importantly support all the tree parts is your stand just a quick note about storage the box at your tree came in is not intended as a storage box your tree is best stored loosely packed in a cool dry place now we have the tree unpacked the next step is to look for the instructions that have come with the tree and at the same time look for two spare bulbs that came with your tree many times they'll be attached to the instruction sheets or they may be attached to a cord on the tree but now it's the time to find those and put them in a safe place where you won't forget them the next step and it's a very important step the instructions are going to tell you about your tree stand now the tree stand is the foundation of your tree so you need to get that unpacked and properly assembled the legs up so snaps in place so that's a very easy step there and your tree is ready to go together now we still have these three parts that we have to get out of their packaging I mentioned earlier that you don't want to use a knife or anything please use scissors because your tree has light sets on it and there may be a loose wire and if you go in there willy-nilly you may wind up cutting the wire so just carefully open them up you know gently one other thing to look at is at the end of many of the tree pull your trunk of your tree there may be these plastic caps you need to remove those those are just to ensure dirt there's no damage while the trees being shipped now you have their stand assemble it's time to start setting your tree up the first section to go in of course is the bottom section which was marked on the carton that it came in but if you have any trouble identifying it the bottom section is always going to have this pencil point on the end of it now that pencil point you just insert into your tree stand and very important thing to remember is you have to have make sure that that is down into the tree stand just reach underneath and you'll be able to feel the bottom of the pole and it should protrude just slightly from the bottom to stand so you're there you have a nice firm base the next thing that we're gonna do is starts folding down the branches before you do that or after it right after you do that it's always a good idea to plug your tree in now you see this green band that comes with it with the tree you're gonna want to cut that off right now we have the lower section of the tree in the stand and all the branches folded down we just have to put the middle section of your tree in and on most trees they may have a little keyhole that they fit into so just twist it around you notice that one dropped right down and it's firmly in now the temptation of a lot of people are is to open up this top section but a little tip from the pros is to keep this tied up and shape your bottom section and then come up and shape the top section so these branches are all out of your way basically what you want to do your tree opened up like an umbrella and now you have to open up each individual branch like an umbrella so all you have to do is just fold open all these tips up fold them back and so they have a slight angle going out you just proceed from the back from the trunk out to your end of your branch you just keep folding those up and as you see it becomes much fuller it fills in the middle of the tree so you can't see Theory tree looks nice and full when it's nicely fluffed okay at this point you have your middle section securely placed on the bottom section and just like the bottom section you want to light up your middle section before you let the branches down and continue shaping the tree now we are up to the top of the tree as you can see it's a very small section one of the things you can do on larger trees is opening up these branches before you put them in and you can actually shape the whole top but since this is only a six and a half foot tree you can still do it either standing if you're tall or on a stool but basically it's just a square peg that fits into a square hole on the top of a trunk at a tree and just place that in there and once again plug your top in and you have your tree all lit and with a little bit of time and effort you have it shaped and ready to go for the holidays and there we have it our six and a half foot tree is assembled if there are any questions that we haven't answered in this video please visit our website and thank you for watching ",

        "content": "hey guys this is sam and Christmas is in two weeks time and I've seen a lot of people like putting up their trees and everything so I think so amazed at how in other countries you can actually get real like pine trees real christmas trees and you can really decorate them and look so so cool but for people in malaysia you can't really do that so what we do is we make this fake Christmas tree and it is like exactly the same thing as a Christmas tree and a lot of you have been wondering Samuel how do you make the fake Christmas tree so I'm going to show you today how you can build your very own Christmas tree but of course you have to buy it and i bought mine from neon sign permit but you can write anywhere you want and it's really quite cheap so yeah p.s all you really need me your own fake Christmas tree is three things in your tree your ornaments and in your brain ok but if you watch this video all you have to do is your eyes your ears and your map of it you don't you tell your eyes on you yeah your mom so that you can laugh along with me so the first step that you wanna do is you wanna take your track new that you haven't used in a long time and you only use for hanging your clothes when they are not dry and you just put it aside and you realize how to do the floors and your night oh my god so dirty so you will take some things the vacuum cleaner zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom and go back to my king because you have plenty of spare time and nothing too and i think the mini vacuum imma kill my camera here over here with you and you're done oh wait you're not done because at the ground you still see a very large patch so you take your duck mom and your mop it pop it pop it pop it yeah and you're not done yet because there's still the patched up so you will just cover and go because when people see how dirty you are and you just start wiping it with tissue paper getting cleaner and so part of myself gay and of them so yeah dude Oh your dad oh and mop mop mop and you done then you want take out your tree and you have like labored parts are a b c d e f and g 87 abcdefg abcdefg you have seven parts of the tree so yeah you just find out each package village and you put down the ground like that and totally put them out of the cameras and go so that no one can see it so yeah how dumb and I yay so anyway you take the bottom of the tree and you just screw it together and realize that you screw it too tightly so that you cannot put that tree in then you just readjust it and put the tree in yet this step the trunk yeah the tree the fig tree from tell me then you just put the G label brunch us on and since you want to keep it nice and clean bastille so you close everything up so yeah the d everything up again and then just open that Slough it around and then start we'll get onto s laughs laughs laughs laughs yeah stop it off it off I said oh whatever and then you take your super pill that will make you look like super super fast and yeah you're stopping fast OMG like the doctors told me not to take the pill but who cares inside someday to sell red bull and the other 184 / 7 it's some unknown substance yeah look at sea I'm moving so fast moves at the top ready so yeah and now you realize that your camera angles up so you know we fix your hammer anger in the God and your last party so put on the last few leaves up stands on what everyone caught on this off a tree okay so then you just put it down put it down put it down put it on and it looks kinda empty now why is not going to MP once you have the ottomans in okay don't judge hashtag equality and now you're done so yay pose for the camera come closer and then you can as you can see look up the whole trees here so don't worry like i said about the ornaments and now just am at my face and yeah and then now it's time for the ornaments but first let me take a selfie no first you put the lights and because i'm lazy and I don't want to put the light back in the box so I just taught you about Scott to cut two slits out of the box and I just put the lights around the world around that so yeah that your life height that you can use for your Christmas season Yorkers were slight and I'm putting around the Christmas tree so many times because I'm a dumb  and I don't know how to put your christmas lights ugly and i put it like separated too far oh yeah ok so now going up and down up and down all around and you're just trying to make it nice a nice and now you take your last bit of your lights and just told them throw down and then you disappear for me oh and then you reappear and define your light so this I looked away what is it off I'm waiting yay light so desire Christmas light and don't worry actually looks a lot better in person rather than now because either the fancy lighting in the background is just too bright because I'm poor but anyway now it's time for the decoration of the on one so you start with your tinsel civil color you wrap it around the tree because who doesn't like tinsel and of course you are wrapped it around the feet then you go to onto your go tinsel and wrap it round wrap it round wrap it up and down then you move on with your another 20 tinsel and they kick the tree and then you realize you have a lot of balls so you just grab the walls around the tree not wrap it around until you like hang it around the tree and don't forget the backside because everyone loves a good backside so anyway you start doing and get born so 20 minutes late here so I'll 30 minutes yo chill made you feel like this and you hang more of it running around and you get about so what do you want to do and to go around take some balls and start stirring of how can that you are by starting to juggle the balls and then you realize oh shoot you can juggle so want to want to oh no I can juggle I can tell oh oh oh  oh oh and everything's falling apart so you just don't mind trying to juggle and you just keep on decorating the tree so you hang the balls that you drop just now just wing it just hang it just make it hang it and really really don't seriously and also sense don't forget that you should hang it not only for the cameras angle but for the side too and last but not least you need your Christmas star so now you're done so thank you so much for watching this video if you liked it make sure thumbs up this video make sure

        "content": "this is Randy from vikrama company and I'm here to help guide you through setting up your Christmas tree using a few easy tips will help ensure your tree looks good for this holiday season we will start by opening the box and removing the contents when I'm boxing be careful when using a box cutter or other sharp objects so as not to damage the product be sure to save the box it'll be used for storage after the tree has taken down I'll set the box cutter depth just to cut the tape in the plastic but not to go so deep as to cut anything more than that start by removing the contents of the box we're gonna remove the Christmas tree stand and each of the sections of the tree many of our trees also come with an extra set of lights this is just an emergency set of lights in case something is not quite working you can use this to illuminate the section of the tree that's not working and call Vickerman immediately and we'll take care of the actual problem and get the tree working the way should first thing we're going to do is review the contents of the box we have our stand and we have our sections a B and C all labeled I also recommend that we plug in the section into a outlet just to verify that all lights are working and everything is fine Vickerman uses a hinged metal stand which means that stand is all one piece and will swivel to the open position when you swivel to the open position you'll see a hole that will that will come into alignment and you'll Bella see through it this is where the thumb screw will go into you'll put the thumb screw turn it through so it just gets through both pieces of metal and stop right there for now and now we're going to take is the bottom section which is the last letter in the alphabet that came with it which in this case is C when we take off these caps that come with the poles we'll see that section C in this case is the pointed one the pointed one is always the one that goes into the stand and we're gonna put section C slip it into the stand and then tighten the thumb bolt on the stand next I recommend plugging in the Christmas tree section into a power source and starting to turning on the lights bickerman trees over six and half feet tall have a step on switch that you can use the turn lights on and off next will start to shape the tree first bring all the branches down on the bottom row and then we'll we'll start to do the tips a great looking tree starts with great shaping and that's done branch by branch and tip by tip first of all we're gonna show you what a branch is now each one of these things that are coming down is a branch okay and each branch has many tips on it all these tips serve a function some of them look really amazing on the outside and in the back is used to fill in so that you can't see through your tree so you always start with these tips in the back your jewelry of them and you put one up to cover the pole and put to use on the side and anything else fills in and when you're putting is going across you keep going to cover knowing that there's space where you've missed the first time and you just keep going that direction when you get to the edge you'll notice that there's little smaller branches that come off those will pull out to the sides and then you'll shape the end properly shaped treat at a 7 1/2 foot tree takes about 45 minutes to an hour to shape and when you get done shaping it's gonna look amazing once you're done with the first branch move to the next branch and go around each of the rows and after that as row is done then you'll drop down to the next row and start again on the next row once you're done shaping all the branches and all all the rows of this of this section the section should look about like this we're now ready for this putting on section be on top of section see quick tip when putting section B intersection C rub a bar soap on the pole on section B before slipping it in and when you're taking down your tree it should come out easier so here we go let's put section B on top of section C slide it right in and here you'll see we have another cord coming out of the bottom this cord is labeled section 2 and our label 2 and it's going to plug in to the spot that has a 2 on it on the section below take down the first row and start shaping the tree again now that section B is shaped the tree will look about like this and the only section now we put on a section a an a will fit into the insert on section B and string the cord labeled number one on top down into the tree finding the number one and the outlets and plugging to get in now we'll just pull down the branches and shape this section alright now that you have your tree up you can see it looks beautiful as it is what we can do now is just kind of look step back from the tree take a look and see if you can see any areas that could use a little extra adjusting holes or maybe that there's uneven lighting and just give it a little bit of a little adjustment so here for example we might have a hole just make your little changes pull a little lighting down into the area and then step back and take another look once you've done that a few times you'll see that the tree is beautiful and ready for Christmas thank you for taking time to watch the video on how to set up your Christmas tree for more information please visit

        "content": "good evening and welcome back tonight I'm going to show you how to make a very luxurious Christmas tree using natural products and fresh flowers and as usual we need a few special ingredients we need a Christmas Carol Anne a little bit of sparkle and bubbles firstly I'm going to teach you how to make these beautiful from natural decorations to hang on your Christmas tree and for these you're going to need dried oranges drug limes cinnamon sticks apples even some chilies to get started you need to fashion a needle so we need quite a thick stub wire okay and we're going to bend that into now you need to squish it as hard as you can before you squeeze it completely right a bit of raffia through it as we start with our first bit of orange and push it through we'd bring that all the way through and then we tie it and you can either leave it hanging like that or when it comes through you can tie it in a bow it's good because it doesn't have to be precise does it it looks nice and rustic so then once you've got your starter find whatever you want now these are a bit trickier they're quite hard to get through so you need something like a skewer to make your little hole for you and that's just like a tangerine orange dessert this is just simply a tangerine orange that they've dried and where would you find things like this i buy them for the wholesaler and you can get them from your local florist even supermarkets so these are little bags now choose what you'd like to put on pass it through and it's just a case just reading it through and it smells so nice to smell amazing yeah that's it okay it's like the whole room smells beautiful absolutely so what else do we have we have some chillies you're feeling adventurous and you want to add something a little bit different take the Ranger in and put that on finish off with an orange that's your final piece so then you can cut you tie that in a knot tie it in a topknot here but that just took seconds to me perhaps of every seconds and if you were to buy something as sophisticated looking as there and you just fell in there 12 pounds or a very high class gift or something yeah exactly beautiful wonky that one just hangs on your treasures long-lasting and extremely natural very nice I like that that you put a beautiful little bow on that you've got suppose if you had a color theme going for a tree you could do different bows like that yeah tartan or yeah I mean I would probably not go to many bows you know just because if you want to keep your tree very natural very much longer are you but in that case you could throw away and the other thing that you can do though instead of putting them necessarily on here is you can actually tie the boat directly onto the tree but for me the more rustic the ribbon the better following on from these we're actually going to make a garland of these so you will probably need longer and again you buy this at craft shops and you can buy raffia most flourish these days have raffia you can buy them I think even in places like home base of ink you feeling like that usually longer because I wanted to stay as long as possible so just a bit like sewing yeah make sure you hold on to that so it doesn't so literally start from the bottom again and work all your way up and you just need to keep adding whatever combinations you need to get to a full size garland and I'm going to let you tell you around with that for a minute I'm going to come back to the Christmas tree and show you how to put natural fresh flowers on your Christmas tree anything from this stilling year which is absolutely brilliant I love this every Christmas it's simple little berries still in gear it's a very strange name simple little they look like berries they're actually not there quite fairy and they last pretty much dried so they last so we need to do is wire the end this one here we're just going to pop that onto one of the stems and wire it on so if you couldn't forget this say any festive colored dried flowers you could do the same thing you can do this with literally anything and I'm going to show you you can do it with Hypericum berries I mean these are completely natural and very fresh today but if you take off although that believes those berries will last and then you just go round and round around said you've got a bit of a leg at the end and then you pop it onto the tree and use the wire to go around the stems and it looks like it's going off the Christmas tree but it's so effective it's a wonderful viburnum berries they've got a blue to the blue team so you could go down to the woods or forage if you have a fabulous garden you're away laurel bushes bay trees ivy it's one of my favorite things at Christmas is the snow and as we don't always get snow in this country yeah I can buy it and then gently amazing and it does literally look like your cheese coming from outside this is very relaxing very therapeutic doing crafty things this is where we come to the fresh flowers these hydrangea heads are one of my favorite flowers and especially as you get to this time of year they two-tone so the only colour are left in them is on the edges and once they start to go green in the middle and have a color on the edge they dry really nicely so even if you cut them now why than one two or three time Christmas's here they'll be drying they went around and they don't go crusty they just stay as they are but join me for top-up yes please be wonderful I'm feeling very more fortuitous you are the natural natural spirit I am you know what's what's so satisfying about this Lu is that you feel that you've done something so sophisticated and people are going to comment and say oh my goodness how did you do that and yet it was so simple there one thing I forgot to say at the very beginning it's always make sure you put your lights on your tree before you start and that they work and my I don't put all the lights on the tree and then plug it in plug it in test that they work and actually I think swirl them around the tree while they lit so you can actually see where they go and how they look here this is populous buried eucalyptus it comes in this kind of ready to use we all can get it in there simple green and it all just adds to the spruce of the tree and so really just be adventurous come out with a bag and see if you can snip it snip it so it's coming along nicely yeah thank you - oh I'm already in spawned how's your garden who's forgotten oh that ends not ties ok mistake here we go so just flip that in to do the same thing and that's gonna go on the tree need to find a nice place we do have to remember that these are a bit more heavy heavy than your normal tinsel and here's when we made earlier but you also look so professional it's cinnamon cinnamon sticks oranges apples everything's and we're gonna do the same thing with that nestled it into the tree further back in the tree you gets it the more likely it is to this day these are all glass baubles basically I've got a hole in the side and inside for safety reasons we use these love little battery-operated tea lights and every year I do something different and this year I went to Washington DC and I found these little creatures and it works doesn't have some other little creatures then I found these came from and I do believe they were $2.99 I mean I think if you if you look you will find a my little snowy owls finally you need every training star on the top I mean some people love to make the whole thing themselves but this time home base came to the rescue once again the fact that you have been so chic that you don't have cute seating because Christmas is about children too and they love to come around oh we love that because we can be sort of high arch style and just keep it so just so and no it is about children it is about wonderment and having kind of cute operated the style and the wonderment it's an opportunity to feel the magic and the simplicity and the family and the friendship and all of the things that Christmas means to everybody that sons were offering to help Cheers Merry Christmas Christmas Lou and Merry Christmas to you too ",

        "content": "greetings I'm Chad clink community for sure with the Holden Arboretum and today we're here to talk about site selection of trees we're going to actually plant the tree and then talk about maintenance and care of your trees it's a critical piece for any homeowner anyone that owns a tree to ensure sustainable care of their tree so I look forward to teaching you about tree care today so in terms of site selection we want to select the site that is both conducive below ground and above ground one component of that is making sure that the soil is conducive to the tree that you're going to plant there you can look at the soils texture you can look at you can test the soil you also want to make sure that there aren't any utilities currently in place where the soil is you can call ahead and make sure your atilla tees are marked before you plant your tree you also want to make sure that there aren't any utilities above ground considering the mature height and spread of the tree to other components of the landscaped is also a critical piece in this process alright now that we've selected a site that is appropriate we can look at our treat talk about aspects of selecting your tree for the site we want to make sure we select a tree that has very strong structure one central dominant leader branches that are spread out radially around the main stem we also want to make sure that the stock has a root flare present invisible at the time of planting and again picking a tree that's going to be successful in the landscape based on your needs are you planning a tree for shade are you planning it for backyard wildlife are you planning it to reduce heating &amp; cooling costs are you planning it just for a sheer landscape accent all these are important components in selecting a tree for your home landscape so now that we've considered site selection and tree selection we can talk about planting we want to make sure at planting that our hole is twice as wide and that our root flare is that surface level or great and now we'll move on to actually show you the planting process and now we're ready to plant our tree today we have a container ice tree but there are options available you can also plant balled and burlapped trees and bare root trees there's pros and cons to each of these a lot depends on season time at which the balled and burlapped trees are dug but for all all those points considered today going to plant this containerized piece all right so now that we're ready to plant Charles here is going to help me get this containerized tree out of its container very carefully so Charles is going to lift on the stem as I shake away and knock the container and set it back down and one thing to consider with containerized stock is that you need to shave the exterior entrance of the root system so we can do this with the saw any kind of retractable saw will work you take your saw and you want to shave this exterior inch or so away from the root ball this helps to encourage new roots to grow and will limit the spread of any kind of girdling roots so it's a proactive measure in hopes of sustaining the tree for a very long time in the landscape and we'll just continue to spin it around taking about an inch or so and at this point to you can take an opportunity to actually inspect the root system make sure that there aren't any immediate girdling roots around the root flare and the main stem of the tree gurgling and kink roots can be removed at the planting process because they really limit the trees ability to effectively move necessary foods to and from the roots and stem so again just breaking up the roots that are in place here in hopes of establishing the tree rapidly in the landscape so Charles is again going to assist me we want to make sure on the bottom of this container I stock that there aren't any existing girdling roots as well thankfully this one has been grown in an air printing container but a lot of your container I stock won't have that it'll have sometimes a circling dense Matt of roots that are on the very bottom so we just want to make sure one final step before we get this tree in the hole that we shave the bottom of the roots so Charles is going to help me lift this up we're going to grab the tree on each side shuffle it into the hole take a final check make sure that the tree is close too close to grade and from here we're going to fill it in with soil to make sure that the trees dirty and in its place alright so now we have our tree in place Charles and I have backfill the tree about half way to make sure that it's steady in its current transplanting spot also we've watered this a little bit to help pack the soil get some of the air out make sure that it doesn't settle too much after we finished planting it one final check before we finish backfilling at the rest of the way is to make sure the tree is vertical and well oriented in the landscape so that it looks aesthetically pleasing and will last a long time we've finished backfilling our tree the remainder of the soil has been lightly packed in around to make sure that the tree is stable in the landscape but there are still some final checks that you can do to ensure that your tree is appropriately planted one of those is making sure that the root flare which is the point of transition between the stem and the actual root system itself is at surface level or at grade or a little bit above this will account for any settling that might occur with your container I stock and the final step after this is to check for any tags that might be up in the crown and finally give it a little bit of watering in so it's important once you finalize planting to make sure your trees get immediate drink of water we want to focus the watering right around the root flare area again and right around 10 5 to 10 gallons at planting we'll talk a little bit more about aftercare watering but you want to make sure that these trees get a good drink right away in the immediate vicinity of the root ball so that define ephemeral feeding roots or the roots that really are integral to the trees health are are safe and protected and not incurring too much shock all right so now that our trees been planted we're going to steak or show an example of how you would appropriately stake a tree once it's been transplanted important considerations and staking your tree you want to make sure that you use non gurgling material so plastic fabric similar to this here wood stakes driven into the ground in close proximity to the tree and then attached with some kind of non gurgling material to the trunk important to consider as well that you need to come back and inspect to make sure that even these materials don't girl the tree but this will help the tree to establish itself not be too stressed out with wind shaking the root ball and set down some new routes into the prepared planting hole alright so now that we have our appropriately planted tree we've applied some mulch we want to apply it two to three inches of mulch within the drip line of the tree or the area where the branches and leaves are we want to take special care to keep it away from the root flare and the stem often times you'll see what's called volcano mulching where the mulch is piled up onto the stem and this is an inadvisable practice on this encourages girdling roots can increase insect activity and microbial activity they actually decays and injures the tree over time alright so we've covered a lot in terms of site selection tree selection and how to appropriately plant a tree but there still are some critical components of caring for your tree long-term so we're going to discuss that further now so caring for your tree requires watering we want to make sure that newly transplanted trees get at least ten gallons of water per week throughout the growing season and that's just not a quick trip trickle you want to make sure that you're out there when it's not raining so that the tree is and going through long periods of drought so 10 gallons of water you know roughly you can use a container one effective way just taking the container up setting it down along the route flare the immediate side of the tree and letting it water other options also include Gator bags or even a five-gallon bucket with the hole in the bottom this allows for a slow percolating of the water into the root system which actually is more available to the plant than if you were to just water rapidly so really an important piece is watering so pruning your tree is another important component of aftercare we don't necessarily don't want to prune at planting it's sort of a misnomer and something that's been debunked over the years initially we thought that pruning at planting was beneficial because you're compensating for root loss through removal of the actual tree's leaves and branches but this is not advisable by any means once your tree is established you can prune for structure but immediately at planting the only thing you really want to remove is dead diseased or dying branches or anything that's really structurally unsound rubbing but you don't want to take off a lot of the plants living foliage because that's what's going to help the tree establish itself in the next growing season alright so we've covered a lot today we've talked about how to appropriately water mulch and prune your tree but there are often some other questions that come up frequently asked and one is you know should I fertilize my tree at planting and the answer really is no you should at least give your tree a year to establish itself and then from there we can provide some prescription fertilization also in terms of watering people often ask if a quick spritz is enough to water your cheering the answer's no we want to make sure that the tree gets watered frequently at frequent intervals throughout the week so this is chad clink community forester withholding Arboretum please stay tuned for more videos or check out our website holdin on org thank you ",

        "content": "first up in the process is to determine a suitable location in this case it's in a sunny area away from other plants in the middle of the lawn now this could easily well be in the bed but for this particular example we're going to put it in the lawn so once we've marked the location and the location is quite important you have to accommodate for drainage that is to say if there's water running by it you have to make sure that's well clear of it you want to make sure that the plant is getting adequate Sun or shade depending upon the type of plant that it is this particular Japanese maple require sunlight so it's in the bright Sun once we have the location fixed then the next step is to mark and Digger hole we mark the hole by making it abruptly twice the size of what the container is we're going to strip off the sod that is now where the tree is to go all right we have our circle cut and the sada is stripped off now we're ready to dig now generally speaking relief the grass you're going to find some decent soil this is the top so it's sort of a dark dish color and that we're going to retain we're going to put that on to this tray right here now below that layer of topsail you will find there's usually lots of other stuff sometimes it's heavy clay which is very clumpy in this particular case it's sand and you can see there's a difference in color there that's quite obvious the fact that that's obvious is not always readily apparent to those that are new to digging but in this case this is sand for where we are planting this plant in downtown kitchener and this sand would be a bit of a problem because root systems do not generally root into sin so if we have to dig the hole much deeper this sand material would be taken away and disposed of now the good news is that most of this poll is top soil around it so the actual amount of sand we're going to have to remove is very very small the planting depth the planting depth for this hole is quite critical because a lot of plants are quite sensitive to the height at which they are planted and the rule of thumb is that it's always better to be a wee bit higher than it is to be low or even in this particular instance because we're on sand it's not a mistake if we were even but we're going to at some point in the future make a bed around this so what we're going to do in the interim is we're going to have the bed or the plant itself sit a couple inches higher than the lawn which is really the the norm in order to establish how high that should be we put a board across the whole and that board being roughly inch and a half to two inches thick will give us some indication as to where the top of that root ball should actually be and that way we can assess how deep the hole has to be enough and go to the plant itself then take it out of this pot and we do that by just shaking it off and you'll see the root system is very nice and healthy it's white and we put that in our whole now see how deep we are and we can see now we decided to dig a hole deep enough to go to China it would appear or to Japan where this Japanese maples from but so in fact we're going to have to build the soil up in the hole in order to bring this root ball up such that the top of the root ball is roughly even with the top of the wood so in order to do that we're going to use a good planting low mix now the good news is we have so much top cell from our whole we won't have to buy or supply all that much now not everybody is going to be so fortunate to have this much top so I'll come out of a hole and for those who don't what we do is we supply a there is a bag soil that we would use this is a three-in-one mix parkwood triple blend and we're going to actually use some of that soil mix mix it with some of this soil to put it into the hole to support the tree so now we've dumped some of the good soil and some of the that come out of the bag and some of our soil into the hole and now we're going to do is we're going to take all this I'm going to mix it all up so that they're 12 mixed together it so happens that I have a little bone meal so I've added a bit of bone meal to my cake batter as it were that we're going to continue to mix in now it's not essential to put bone meal in but if you have it by all means do so now we have it sort of loose and fluffy right now and of course we can't just use it like that we're going to do is we're going to step it down so we're going to go in here and we're going to make my guy making wine with grapes we're going to firm it down a little bit now you not jumping on it all you're doing is trying to compress adjust the wheat had when we add our final solution to the whole it will settle some more but right now we want to have a little bit firm so that we have some of the air but not all of it take it out of the hole so now let's put our tree in and we'll see how we are for depth now get our stick more closer but we still have to come up with just a week had more okay now we have our whole partially filled in with a little bit of compacted soil good soil and we can see now that the root ball is roughly the same size the same height as our stick that is coming across which means that in fact the root ball now is the same distance higher than the lawn now if this was on a slope which is it's not you know it's quite imperative that the root ball be slightly even or higher than the highest side of the slope rather than the lowest side that way that root ball is definitely sitting higher than the grade so now what we're going to do is we're going to put our tree in the correct position we're going to backfill it and compact the soil around it we do that very simply what we're going to do is we're going to pack it down and this is a relatively straight process we just take our heel and very gently at the edge of the root ball we go in just with a heel push down into the soil to firm that soil down we want to jump on it and the course a fellow who's heavier obviously makes a bit more of an impression than someone who's builded lighter but all we're doing now is we're going to firm the tree in the whole of course we want to verify that we got it straight which we do which is a good thing because it's hard street note after the fact but that's all we have to do in order to affirm that soil in there we just do that if round here maybe once or twice it doesn't have to take very much this root ball is now still visible you can see it right here there's the root ball and the actual soil is going to cover that root ball by maybe an inch it the most we don't want to have this thing buried too deep in fact having that this this part of the trunk very deep with soil is a bad idea because a lot of plants are very sensitive to the depth of which they're planted so this is actually higher than the lawn okay and the soil is only going to be a little bit higher than what the root ball it we have our soil and there it is the root ball down here which I said before is longing to be about an inch or so buried which it is it's just a little bit but the next and very most important thing is we have to make a saucer or a soil sauce and a soil saucer is just that it's a rigid so just like when you were playing in the sandbox as a kid I'm going to make a ridge of soil roughly at the edge of the root ball so the root ball isn't about here somewhere you're going to make a regicide such that when you water it the water is going to fill this saucer up and then percolate down directly where the root ball is and this is quite important because if you don't do this the water may run all over the place and isn't necessarily going to go directly where the root ball is and the root ball is critical that's the part that needs the moisture not all over the place not around in the lawn and everywhere else but directly where the plants it's okay so we're going to make this saucer and i'll show it to you as soon as i have it finished here and there and there it is the saucer is complete okay the depth of the saucer is roughly I don't know three inches two and a half three inches and of course the saucer isn't going to stay forever it's predominantly to be used during the first year of growth while you're trying to get the plant established now the question is what about mulch well in the case of mulch the mulch could go over the entire surface okay you may elect to keep it away from the center of the trunk simply because it might be a little bit too much buildup of moisture there and sometimes you'll get certain plants that will rot if you do that so usually you want to have just a wee bit of a circle of mulch away from the actual center of the trunk and the last step in the process would be to stake it and you'll see in this particular case there is a stake already attached because it's such a small plant but there will be a more permanent state that's put in there the state goes generally speaking on the northwest side of the tree and that's of course to keep the prevailing wind from blowing the tree over how it's adhered is a number of different ways but suffice it to say that it only needs to be staked for about a year or so just until the root system has rooted in the plant is then you know established as growing straight and the last step of the process after we've made our saucer is of course we're going to fill it with transplant solution so now we've filled up our saucer with transplant fertilizer and it's it's now going to water the root ball in thoroughly and that's that's basically what you need to do when you have to rewire the plant you fill up that saucer you know that's in a couple inches of water and and for many plants that will hold for for a few days it really largely depends as through how much when'd you get the temperature and what sort of soil condition this being a sandy soil of course it dries out a little bit quicker so it might require watering more often than someone who's on heavy clay you'll see that the plant itself the the root ball is definitely a couple inches higher than lawn which is what it's supposed to be and we want to try and maintain the grass away from the actual edge of the tree for as long as possible it definitely looks for a far more professional look in order to do that ",

with root accelerator the plants started with all the good trees are what make your peace of the earth yours planting trees and bushes can save you plenty of money and in an afternoon you could make that statement bring your pictures we will help you pick your perfect plant [Music] honey I'm playing the tree in the yard today where do you think you want it can you show me a couple of different spots what about right here I don't know that may be too close to the house well let me move over to the ride and see if that'll work here's where the tree would be honey and here's the house what do you think perfect let's get started let's talk about planting the tree first thing you want to do is pick a site in the yard for the tree that's gonna help determine what kind of tree we're gonna recommend the other thing that we need to do before you do any planting is have the underground utilities marked there are gas lines electric lines we don't want to be surprised when we're digging the hole to plant the tree once you come down the grass path then we'll talk about what type of tree is gonna be whether you want a shade tree or a fire and ornamental or an evergreen for privacy what do you think about these purple trees they'd look nice or how about these maples yeah I think I like that welcome to grass bed how can I help you I'm showing my wife some trees so these maples are great trees for area does that stay red all year long no it turns a very nice color in the fall is it hard to plant it's easy we've got the grass pad idiot-proof planting guide I think we'll take it now that you've got the tree picked out let's talk about planning we just need to get a few things together before we start you'll need a shovel wheelbarrow piece of cardboard to put the dirt on when you're digging the hole the root accelerator the fertilizer for the new tree some mulch to going around to protect the trunk and the tree from the weed eaters and rabbit we need the tree stake kit and you'll need a bucket or a hose to water it after you've got a plan my uncle always said dig a 20-dollar hole for a ten dollar tree what that means is the holes twice as wide is the root ball but just as deep here's a tip from uncle take a big piece of cardboard put the soil you dig out a hole in it it makes a great mixing platform as well as it keeps the yard clean and makes for easy cleanup we really would like to have the bottom of the root ball sitting on undisturbed soil that way the tree doesn't settle down and end up being planted too deep once you've dug what you think is the right size the easy way to check is you lay the shovel across a hole put your hand on it where it's deep enough you hold the stakes up to the root ball to know if you're at the right depth when we're done digging the hole you want to make sure and scratch up or scarify the sides or the wall of the hole so the roots can penetrate your native soil easily you're gonna take the soil that you dug out the hole mix it with the max mix planting compost at about a 70/30 ratio 70% soil 30% compost [Music] that's going to go back in around the root ball if you're planting the ball the burlap tree don't remove anything until you have the root ball in the hole at that time you can remove the twine or the strapping that's around the trunk uncle says check your container trees for circular roots prior to planting take the tree out of the container you see roots going around in a circle around the outside edge so then take your knife or your shear than the pruners and snip down through so those circling roots stop that growing action as you're back filling you want to take your foot and tamp it down firm you don't have it all loose [Music] once we've got all the back fill in we're gonna put some oak in you'll put your cypress mulch or your most of choice around the tree it's time to stake the tree we're gonna stake it parallel with the prevailing winds which in our part of the world comes from the south so there'll be a stake on the south side two stake on the north side you drive it in the firm undisturbed soil you're gonna run the wire through a hose or through a tube so it doesn't damage the tree because you would like to have a little bit of movement going on we'll need to have this tree stake for the first couple of growing seasons it's time to apply the root accelerator now for that we need a five gallon bucket fill it full of water we're going to put in two cups of the root accelerator [Music] and they're gonna slowly pour that around to a soaks into the root ball we want to do that once a month for the first year if you don't do that you will be amazed at how fast that tree grows cypress mulch or the mulch of your choice we're going to make sure we don't have the volcano up around the trunk because that's like wearing a wet sock all the day long and that's not good well let's talk about water uncle recommend so three two one rule we want to turn the hose on just a trickle where the water is coming out about the diameter of a pencil we'll lay it down and soak it for 10-15 minutes depending on how big a tree it is we're going to soak it three times the first week twice a second week and once every week thereafter it's the first month three two one once you've got that stake everything's put together you're home free it's that easy for these and more tips come see us at the grass pad or you can visit our website as your family grows so does your family tree the grass pad has a nursery full of trees shrubs and bushes bring your

        "content": "hi my name is Oscar sense I am a tree care supervisor with tree people and today we're gonna be planting a 1 gallon oak tree first we're gonna start off with safety we're gonna be using some tools today that are not toys they're tool so we have some rules for them this one is a as all of you know it's a shovel we have to be very careful with this because it has a sharp end so we don't want to carry it over our heads like this or run with them at all be very careful when you're walking and when you're walking carry them like this with the blade facing down if you get very very very tired of using it and want to lay it down or set it up against a tree or something ah don't set it up against a tree lay it down facing like this down where's the point pointing down and then we have this this is a home attic we're gonna be using this to remove some weeds from around the area where we'll be planting and it has two ends when is a sharp blade and the other one has three little things that might really hurt you there we might be using this digging bar this one's really heavy and it's only for 16 and over you use it you lift it up like this and push it down and then wiggle it back and forth we're gonna use this just in case we encounter some really really hard soils and that's the only reason well we'll use it same thing do not lean it up against a wall or a tree or anything at all times when you're handling these tools wear gloves like these it really protects your hands and I've experienced that so I'm wearing them right now we also have another tool these are not pruners these are tin snips and we're going to be using these to cut our gopher cage first we're going to remove the grass the weeds that are it might be growing over the soil and any mulch that might be in the area so we're gonna use our home attic to remove that so I like to cross it like this make little lines crossing it and we'll set all the weeds and mulch up to the side until we get to some nice soil which is right underneath hold we want to make clear an area larger than this gopher cage so we're out in the Santa Monica Mountains here and we're gonna be using this cage it's a gopher cage and it's to keep all those Gophers that are running around here from coming in and starting to eat all the little roots of the tree that we're going to be planting what you do is get like chicken wire and cut it with your tin snips cut it in a way that leaves a little and sticking out and then you use that and intertwine them and then you go to the bottom part and cut a few areas and then will intertwine those as well so you're gonna collapse the cage make a cylinder and then take those ends that you just cut and fold them in so so it's locked so here it is our nice gopher cage it's gonna be protecting the roots of the tree and now that we have our gopher cage ready we're ready to dig the hole we're gonna dig the hole deep enough so we only expose about two inches of this gopher cage I'm using a wheelbarrow here to keep the soil separate from all the mulch and debris around here and so we don't mix it in with the grass because we're gonna use this soil to refill the hole well it looks like it's deep enough and I'm a little bit out of breath so I'm going to check to see if we're at the right theft here and nope we still have six more inches or more to go so now that we have our hole the right size we're get ready to put our gopher cage in and start to refill the hole with soil we're gonna take the soil back just drop it in we have to keep it in mind not to fill it too much because we have our little tree to plant still and as you're refilling you're going to be using this Dibble stick to push the soil down and compact it a little bit inside of the cage and also on the outside all the way around so now that I've put some soil back in I have to start thinking about our tree and how high the root ball is inside of the container so I have to start measuring to make sure I don't plant the tree too deep or too high every time you put soil in stop after a little bit and after maybe two shovel fulls of soil and compact the soil so we don't leave large areas of air pockets inside so now it seems like it's the right depth and I'm gonna put my tree in there and it seems like it is all of you know that the roots belong underground and the trunk belongs above-ground that little section where the trunk turns into the roots it's called a flare and that's that little section is the one that we're measuring that should be right at the same level as the soil around here so I'll stick my hand in there to reach that area and put my other hand out and that's about right that's perfect and if you plant it a little high it's okay but too deep is bad so now the tree can come out we're going to squeeze the sides just a tiny bit to loosen up the roots from the container and then we're gonna make a v-shape with her hand one of the hands and then I've taken off my gloves so I can push down at the bottom there should be a hole that you can push into and here comes the tree so I'm catching it with my left hand and then carefully hold the bottom flip it back up and then you could set it in the hole try to Center it and then start refilling there's a trail right here and I notice that this branch is really growing out toward the trail what I'm gonna do so nobody runs into this branch when it gets bigger is that I'm gonna turn the tree around so it faces the other direction and that will eliminate any danger for this branch now we're going to backfill we're gonna use the same soil we had before and when you if you're doing it the best thing is to do it with a friend right have them hold a tree centered and then just drop the soil in if you see any weeds in your soil go in and remove them and use your Dibble stick to compact the soil inside of the cage and on the outside as well be careful not to hit the roots of the tree and if you get any big rocks just separate them so now I removed all the air pockets around this tree and I'm going to take whatever remaining soil is up around the tree and use that soil to make a berm a berm is like a little hill around the tree and we're pretty much on a slope here so we've just planted a tree but we're not completely done right now we're gonna need to water it give we're gonna give it about three gallons of water and we don't want all of that water to be going down the slope here so we're building a berm even if the soil if the area was flat the water was still run away from the area where the roots are and that's where we want the water to go straight down to the roots so we built our berm to hold the water close to the root ball and now it's time to water the tree we're gonna use this shovel to catch the water when it falls we don't want to erode the soil and expose those roots to the sunlight which will kill them so we poured the water very slowly but we pour about three gallons of water this is really important for the tree so we could establish itself at the very beginning so now we've given our tree the three gallons of water it really really needs at the beginning of its new if it's new home here now it's time to give it a little mulch and mulch is little woodchips pine needles with this one things that fall from trees that's all mulch is it's really good for the tree for many reasons first it stops weeds from growing next to the tree it allows soil water to go down into the soil and it also looks great it's what happens in the forest but too much mulch can be bad we only want about three to four inches of mulch around the tree thickness and we don't want any mulch up against the trunk mulch is also very important because it keeps the sunlight from heating up the soil around a tree and it keeps the root system a little bit cooler especially in the summertime here where it can get very very hot for these trees so we'll play some around top of the roots here just a little bit not up against the trunk but just around on top of the roots and the rest we'll put on the outside that just about covers it just to recap make sure that you're very safer on all the tools and pick a good spot for your tree make sure you remove any mulch that might be on top of the soil start digging your hole put the cage and make sure that the Gopher cage sticks out two inches and then start to refill with soil put your tree end make sure the roots are underground the trunk is above ground so you might have to measure several times and then start to refill that make your berm around the tree to hold the water in and next water your tree three gallons and then add some mulch around it so it looks nice like this we're gonna name this treat Missy so trees need people and people need trees welcome Missy please join us at WWE people org and I hope to see you soon ",

        "content": "Herr heckle from Holley concepts here to show you how to shape the tree this tree is all set up and we're going to go through the process and give you some pointers on how you can take your artificial tree out of the box and make it as gorgeous as this when unpacking your tree make sure that you unpack the box entirely make sure you have all your parts and most importantly make sure you have your instruction sheet because your instruction sheet is going to tell you how many parts should be in there in the instruction sheets also going to tell you how to put your tree together and more importantly on the pre-lit trees how to plug your tree in as you can see here we have our top the bottom the middle section the tree and very importantly the foundation of the tree the all right the first part is setting up your tree is getting the tree stand prepared very important that you read the instructions because it's going to tell you how to put your tree stand together properly and this is the foundation of the trees that you want to have a strong properly assembled foundation so please read the instructions now the bottom section of the tree has a point on it it just gets inserted into the stand and then with this one you just press down in you can feel it go all the way down and then you want to feel underneath the stand to make sure it's the tree is fully seated down in there and then this protect our online we just crank down on this collar which will watch the tree into place so once that's done you're ready to start shaping your tree now that you have your bottom section securely in the stand you can cut this wrapping material very carefully and let the branches fall down now at this point a lot of people will start putting the next section and put the top on what I like to do is shape the tree at this point this bottom section now you notice that I have the tree plugged in all the lights are on I encourage you to do this because if there's as you're fluffing if you hit a loose bulb or something like that the light set flickers you're going to know you're in the general area worker may be a problem but basically when shaping or fluffing the tree this is what gives it makes it pretty looking what I'd like to do is start at the bottom row of branches and just work my way up and since we don't have that middle section in our way it's much easier to do but to show you basically what you want is you need to open up all these small branches and basically what you're doing is just doing it in a fan pattern as you're coming out you just want to go around and do that to all these pets your hand should touch every tip on the tree and it takes a little bit of fun learning an initial setup to do this but you're gonna have a much prettier looking tree at the end it's going to look full it's not gonna you're not going to be seen through it and it's just going to look good for your one of us to go on you just shake the bottom next thing you want to do is put your middle section and once this bottom sections all shapes we have this middle section here now this is another place where it becomes very important to read their instructions because it's going to tell you how to plug your tree in now in this one on the instruction sheet that shows that the middle section plugs in to the bottom section here we have the plug for the middle sections and here's where plugs in to the top section plug it in there and just for purposes here we'll just sort of open that up and then you can go around and shake the tree and the last section the top section this year again this top section will just plug into the middle section which is right here there you go have your treat is on its way to being set up and I have to go through and fluff all these branches which does take the time in on the initial setup and this is a good time to talk about something about storage of the trees but I encourage people to do when they sort a tree is don't try to cram this tree back in the box that it came in that box is for shipping that's not for storage you may be able to store the stand and the section of the tree in that box but what I'd like to do is use large tree storage bags out there or even a old set of sheets you take these trees down it and then the season fold them up gently wrap them up gently and you're gonna stay here sometime your saw sometime next season when you go to set up because the trees essentially already fluffed you just have to maybe tweak a few branches here or there and it's also going to increase the longevity of your tree because these branches are can crush down open back up so the tree is going to look better for a longer period of time and also it's easier on the light set a lot of light set failures that we get are the result of people trying to cram them back into the box bulbs get broken wires get cut if you treat it gently you avoid a lot of those problems now one thing that I do want to talk about as far as the light sets go is these trees come with a little packet of replacement bulbs and you do have to look at the tree these bulbs should last you know 2,500 to 3,000 hours but you do have to look around if you see a burnt out bulb on your tree please replace it quickly what can happen over time is if too many bulbs on one strand of lights are now all of a sudden you'll see a section of the tree lights that seems much brighter than the others and what will eventually happen is also the lights that goes out and you look in all these bulbs are black that's what's known as a cascade essentially what happens is as the bulbs burn out on that strand it overloads the other bulbs and they just sort of supernova and all go out at once and what you have to do is replace every one of those bulbs which is time consuming and easily avoidable if you just replace the bulb when you see it's burns out now as far as replacement bulbs go I said it did come with many replacement bulbs but if you need more one thing to remember with these trees is the voltage on the bowl is 2.5 so you want to look for that type of replacement bulb but the other thing that you need to remember is that this little plastic base is what's known as a husk and it's unique to this light set so you can buy other replacement bulbs and simply pull the glass vial part now so you have just a actually bulb part in the base part and we need to hold onto these bases because there you mean can you can use another 2.5 or volt bulb that comes from a 50 light set then you just insert the glass vial part in you see the dumit wires coming out of the bottom you just bend them back around and start the bulb in there and you have a functioning light setting the different types of tips that you find on a tree right here you can see this is what we know call a like life molded tip it's made out of polyethylene plastic and it's actually molded from a real life tip of a tree ",

        "content": "hello everyone and welcome to another video in this video I'm going to show you how I chose to decorate my tree as well as give you some hints and tips now what I like to do first is choose a theme so because my tree was going to be my lounge room I'm showing you some images of my lad room and why I chose the theme that I did the theme I chose was mainly wooden ornaments to go with the wooden flooring white and silver accents I do have black furniture so I kind of played that along with my black christmas tree which I absolutely love and it works with just about anything once you have you think you can then go in and put on with your ornaments now ignore the red ones that just come in the pack that I used last year I'm just using the white and silver as well as the wooden ones most of these decorations can be found from Maya also definitely needed my beer it was about 35 40 degrees when I film this first I'm starting with a Christmas tree skirt I'm doing this because I do have some glass ornaments I want to protect them from the hardwood floors taking a break because it's super hot and then I'm just going to place on my feet ornaments now a future ornament is something that you maybe you spent a little bit more money on something that means something to you and things that you just find really really pretty I'm going to place them on the tree first this will give me a really nice spacing and then I couldn't put the ones that I'm not too fussed about to fill up the gaps I tried to not go too overboard ornaments this year as I have in the past couple years if you do have a tree up against the wall don't feel the need to decorate the back of it but if a tree is going to be seeing 360 I definitely make sure that your decorating orbit if you have a fake tree like me when placing glass ornaments feel free to bend the little branch back a little bit and then the ornament will be nice and secure and won't fall off most of these ornaments are from meijer from the show in Ho's house and garden collection I'm men just placing on the white decorations in the gaps that I have now it's not the end or where you place your ornaments you can kind of adjust them to get the spacing right and the way that you like it and just to keep applying them in that theme that you like and try and break up the colors try not to have too much wood in one place or too much red in one place if that's your thing I love these little our ornaments they're so cute but they are a little bit heavy if you do have a heavier ornament the next branch up because it's going to hang where you want it in the space anyway so that I'm just kind of finishing off with some close-ups of my little ornaments I absolutely love this collection it was a little bit more pricey but I really wanted to go all out for my first Christmas in my own home so that's my finished Christmas tree and then I'm going to go in with a silver star place that on top which I can barely reach because I'm so short that's my finished dream I hope you enjoyed this video and got something helpful out of it if you did please give a thumbs up and leave a comment if you like bye in today's video I'm going to show you how to create these do-it-yourself Christmas tree ornaments ",

12 hours that is what our tree is going to look like supposedly and we can see right here it'll begin to see we will begin to see results in one to two hours let's flip the package over yeah yeah it includes three components the treat look continue the package and yeah it says solution tree package solutions yeah it's open istic components let's open this bad boy up okay but first let's see what it says here notice the rate of growth for the tree depends primarily on temperature humidity in air flow of the environment the tree will grow much faster and higher temperature and lower humidity environment increased airflow will also increase the rate of growth of the tree you don't see results up to 12 hours it's was likely due to environmental conditions please refer to above ideal growing conditions okay so we have the instructions here we're not going to go over those right now we're going to put those aside and read them off camera so we're going to pause right here we'll be right back okay guys we're back and here's the instructions for the grow your own tree set spread the leaves of each branch of the tree outward okay oh yeah so let's put it put this into here I surprise release editor that was the part yeah cuz I oh I'm thinking next you're supposed to put it in here help you Adam there put this star yeah gonna have the star right start the show huh hey you're funny

for the money if you didn't know any money RPGs and just just kidding just kidding okay I'm done oh he locks in there nice and tight I like that yeah all right well that's good enough that's what we're gonna do flop him back down there Jake walking been really pushing in lock it in these things heard farm all right so here is our tree he's in the base what's the next step Jake no I suppose I'm thinking we're supposed to cut the solution bag of order yep pour all the contents of a solution bag into the base all right so here we go that's small a solution yeah let's come on in for you all right carefully pour the solution into the base does it smell uh-huh was this really hmm I don't know all right for the solution and into the into the base all in there get every last drop out of their top of a nice and tight all right that's great well uh you know why it's great cousin my wife's dankai tom okay says let's stand in a safe place the tree will begin to grow in about one hour that'll be fully grown in 12 and the tree will last three to four days for indoor ornamentation and decoration so what do you think is going to happen to that solution I think I don't know I think I think it's like a growing jail it's gonna suck it all up and make it right there yeah that's what I was thinking the tree is somehow gonna suck up all that solution and kind of make this kind of paper stuff grow yeah so well that's all we have today and tomorrow we'll continue our video that'll be about 12 hours later and so will show you guys then from Daddy and JT we have ok button I have no name for a channel yet so if you like us subscribe and leave us a comment about what you think our channel name should be well we had fun and we'll show you the results in just a little bit and here is the Christmas tree it's been exactly 25 hours and would you look at that uh-huh isn't that something yeah look at the detail on it looks almost like like crystals formed off all the branches did you expect that haha I just up a dark green like the bushes yeah and look it look at that sounds like a little oh well now that I got some army i guess i can feel it huh where does it feel ok Thea oh it kind of like turns to it to like a powdery dust like it grew out of it and turned to a powdery dust yeah and it says this decoration will last i believe it was three or four days i'll check the package will say yes is true will last three to four days for indoor ornamentation no huh that's pretty neat that's for you I couldn't believe it when we woke up this morning Jake and I saw her and it was just ah it was good it wasn't this good like it grew even more it sucked up all that liquid yeah wonder if we can knock a little bit odd I'll show you how to not gonna look at that oh yeah it just comes right off what is that yeah I know someone comment below yes I'm doesn't comment below if you know what what this stuff is that is your science nerd out there yeah right but like if you squish together it turns into a powder at a powdery dust it it's really good oh you know what also it kind of reminds me of what a broccoli floret like you've ever seen like cooked broccoli like it has like the little heads looks like a broccoli and of course we don't need to save this tree because it's August right now it's not even close to it december so yeah it's right down right now right I think we did a good job of it yeah let's wreck this thing well guys here's the tree is a final look before Jake does all the scraping off of it I think that's that's good that's good all right now I got no we got a whole bunch of just play with all right do everybody looks like you know what it also also looks like um bits of a dandelion the white little see parts of the dandelion yeah but it's something we accept green yeah well guys that's all the time we have for this video this is dad and Jake will seal it ",

        "content": "[Music] we wish you a Merry Christmas [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel on this channel we talk white food family and fun and life right now has a lot to do with Christmas so I'm gonna teach you two ways to make a Christmas centerpiece that will knock the socks off your guests and they're edible we want to see that I mean stay tuned and let's do this [Music] you are new here thanks for stopping by I hope you'll consider subscribing that's that red button down there and then when you do hit that bell so that you're notified of every video I post which happens every Tuesday and Thursday and there's always something new now last week I showed you a video on making salted caramel crack which is a crowd pleaser you can throw that together in 15 minutes super super easy and great to take to any holiday party everyone will love it I guarantee you can't eat just one if you did not catch that video I will link it in the cards above and at the end of this video so that you can check that out if you want something just super simple quick easy to throw together at the last minute for a great holiday sweet snack but this one in case you're hosting a holiday party or you're going to one where you really want to bring something that's really gonna wow your guests this is it and they are actually really easy to make they're just a little time consuming that's all but they're super super easy so the first one is going to be a centerpiece that I actually entered with my mom into a competition we won this competition for the best table and it's really really easy the only thing that you really have to buy is a cupcake tower I'll have a link in the description to grab one if you don't have one and then you're going to need a tip that makes leaves for frosting so any kind of frosting tip that makes leaves and a frosting bag to be able to pipe on the green leaves those are the only kind of odd things that you might have to buy for this so the first thing you're going to do is make your favorite cupcakes it's as easy as that you can do red velvet you can do chocolate you can do you can do a spice cake if you're doing a keto diet I have a spice cake recipe with cream cheese frosting that's amazing I'll link that there you can do whatever you want for cupcakes the only thing that you have to consider is that you need a white frosting so you need a cream cheese frosting or vanilla frosting something that's white white chocolate and that you can turn green with green food coloring so that's what you're gonna do make green food coloring spread a thin layer over the top of those cupcakes and then you're gonna pipe on leaves to make it look like a tree because basically what we're doing is we're making a Christmas tree out of this cupcake tower so once you have your cupcakes made with the leaves piped on all you're gonna do is use sprinkles for toppings now I found ones that had really cute little gingerbreads in their little mini gumdrops just things that you can sprinkle on for your ornaments also I hung little mini candy canes little ornaments things kind of all around on those little wires that the cupcakes are setting on and it just looks like you've decorated a Christmas tree in between those areas where it looks sparse to really make it look like a tree I used flat leaf parsley and stuck those in all over the place to make the actual tree and then I just used a sugar cookie to make a star at the base of it I used a gold charger I stuck some Moss that I found Michaels around the base of that and that was your central piece it is absolutely gorgeous it is so easy to make just make sure you put those sprinkles on and everything on the cupcakes before that icing dries so that they will stick also if you are not hosting this in your home I highly recommend assembling this once you've arrived at your location because those cupcake stands are not the most stable things for travel and so if you put those cupcakes in a box take everything with you it only takes a couple minutes to set it up once you get to where you're going and it is absolutely gorgeous I love this everybody loved it it is so easy to make super super fun alternately you can make a fruit platter for Christmas but not just any fruit platter you're gonna turn this fruit into Christmas trees and all you're gonna need is to go to Michael's or Hobby Lobby or if there's someone on Amazon I'll find that and link that below but you're just gonna need styrofoam cones that are green and you'll need two of those that are differing Heights and sizes to give it a little bit of a contrast then I used a plate that was rectangular in shape and put those two cones on that then you get fruit you get toothpicks and you get flat leaf parsley and that is it what you'll do is take these toothpicks and stick them into the styrofoam and then stick your fruit on now sometimes if you're using blueberries or raspberries or blackberries or things that are smaller you're gonna cut that toothpick a little bit down so that it's not sticking out obviously but all you do is stick them all the way around different varying levels Heights all of that and you're gonna make fruit trees and then in between the little gaps in the fruit you'll just take little pieces of flat leaf parsley stick that in all over to fill it in and then I made stars out of pineapple that goes in the top again with a toothpick and then when you are ready to serve just before you're ready to serve you're gonna dust both of these recipes actually but you're gonna dust them with powdered sugar and just do that especially on the one that is the fruit because it will absorb some of that sugar and and it'll disappear you won't so yet but if you dust it with a little sifter over the top it looks like snow has just fallen on your beautiful trees and it is absolutely gorgeous and then people just come by and pick a piece of fruit off super super easy to do it's just a little time-consuming sticking them all in there but I guarantee you people will love these creations they're so beautiful so that's it I hope you've enjoyed this I hope you'll go out and try something for your holiday party to either take somewhere or have at your own home these things are actually really easy to make and they are kind of the Instagram showstopper ones that you'll just get rave reviews over so otherwise I hope you're having a great day stay inspired and I will see you in the next video Merry Christmas ",
