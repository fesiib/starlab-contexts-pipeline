        "content": "Easy to Make French Toast Hello and welcome to in the kitchen with Matt,\nI am your host, Matt Taylor. Today I am going to show you how to make French toast. This\nis super easy to make, let's get started. Now for the ingredients, I have some really\nthick sliced bread; you can use whatever bread you want, sourdough, cinnamon raisin bread,\nwhatever you like. I have a bowl and a fork, I have a pie pan here which works great, I\nhave one large egg, two tablespoons of milk, and one-quarter teaspoon of vanilla. So now\nwhat we are going to do is we are going to crack our egg and add it to this bowl. Ok,\nand then we take our milk and go ahead and add that in there. All right, now let's go\nahead and add our vanilla extract. That will add some nice flavor. Ok, then we will just\ngo ahead and mix this altogether. And it winds up being about one egg, per two pieces of\ntoast. Go ahead and put it in there, and mix it all around, both sides, and I am going\nto set it right here. Let's do another one; we will mop it all up. \nOk we turn our stovetop on, in between medium and medium high. And then once our skillet\nis hot, we take some butter, and we will go ahead and put it on the bottom here, like\nthis, coat the bottom. And grab our toast and put it in, just like that. And you cook\nit until it gets brown; it is about a minute and a half per side. Ok now we want to turn\nthese, ooh that looks great. And then on this side, what I like to do is while it is on\nthere, take some more butter and just put it on the top. Ok now we will take a look,\nit looks good. All right, now what we do is we add our toppings, I am going to do a classic\nmaple syrup and powdered sugar. All right, our French toast is done; you can put whatever\ntoppings you want, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, maple syrup, powdered sugar,\nwhatever you want to do. It is super easy to make, if I can do it, you can do it. I\nam Matt Taylor; this has been another episode of In the Kitchen with Matt, thank you for\njoining me, if you have any questions or comments, put them down below and I will get back to\nyou. Time for me to dive into this. Woah that is good. ",

        "content": "good morning and welcome to Tessa's kitchen this morning I'm going to be making a sweet hearts french toast it's french toast kicked up a notch stuck with mascarpone e cheese and strawberries if you're looking for that special thing to make for that special person this would absolutely be the recipe to make I'm starting off with some simple and beautiful ingredients this is a loaf of potato bread that I got from our local bakery and some really nice strawberries I washed my strawberries very well and sliced about a half a cup to a cup into thin slices the first step is to macerate your strawberries by doing that you want to add a sugar and I'm using honey this is a step that I probably should have done last night you want two strawberries to be refrigerated for at least an hour and overnight is better helps to bring out the flavor and the juices of the strawberries the next step is making the filling and it's pretty easy I have one cup of mascarpone e cheese and I'm adding about two tablespoons of confection sugar and you can make your sweeter if you wish and by the way you want your mascarpone e cheese at room temperature it whips much easier at room temperature than at cold temperature but gotta sneak a taste and now the bread typically a French bread or a French loaf is used for french toast that makes sense but in my kitchen today I'm using a loaf of potato bread the potato bread is dense and I thought it would hold up nicely and we'll just soak up all that egg I'm making three slices of french toast this morning to for him and one for me now comes the tricky part make a cut into the center of the bread from one side Center to the other going around the bottom gently cut into the center towards the top extending your filling area so you can get as much cheese and strawberries in there as you can you want to have a bite of cheese and strawberry in everybody if you wanted you could go ahead and slice the pieces and to spread the cheese place the strawberries and put the top on but I like how the top remains intact and just remember it's the effort that counts place and smear center of each slice of bread with the cheese and make sure that you push some up into the top so each bite has some cheese mascarpone e cheese is not available on all the grocery stores and there is a substitute that you can make and I'll provide that recipe and the show me more section below and the same with the strawberries make sure you get some strawberries up there in the top put one nice layer of strawberries then gently press down on the top to make sure that everything stays in there at this point get your griddle or skillet ready and put it on low heat I have an electric stove and I'll have the heat between a three and four probably start at it for then whenever I flip them I'll turn the heat closer down to three I'll probably end up flipping these two or three times just to get an even browning and to make sure the inside is all melted and heated through you can even add some lemon zest orange zest with cheese to give it more flavor along with the strawberries you can add some lemon juice orange juice a liqueur or even a balsamic vinegar would add flavor you can find this recipe and more on my facebook and google+ page remember to come give me a visit here I have five eggs and about a half a cup of milk I think I went a little overboard on the eggs I probably could have used three i'm also adding a quarter teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and i'm going to give it a good whisk you now dip each side with the egg wash make sure you let the eggs soak into the bread give it some taps with your fork to make sure that the cheese and strawberries are sealed you next melt some butter on the bottom of your griddle or your skillet you and lay in your french toast I ended up flipping these three times and I cooked each side a minute each time you can use any fruit you can use blueberries bananas cranberries blackberries ooh that one would be good and a little sprinkle of confess Jenner's sugar on top you now I'm going to play some strawberries on top just remind them what's inside if you make this stuffed french toast for that special someone I'm sure you'll be getting some brownie points you okay it's time to cut it open and see what's inside beautiful just fill with that rich creamy cheese and fresh strawberries time to give it a taste you wow that turned out amazing I hope you make this love it and enjoy please remember to hit the like button and subscribe for future recipe videos from Kaz's kitchen you can also find me on google+ facebook and pinterest come visit again and enjoy ",

        "content": "Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode\nof Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how I make my waffle French toast. It is so\neasy to make. I absolutely love making it for breakfast on weekends, especially if you\nhave people coming over because it looks like you have really put a lot of effort into it\nbut you really didn't. It is just incredibly simple and easy. The ingredients you'll need\nare very few. What I've got here is some bread - you can use any bread you want. I am using\nmy homemade honey oat bread because it's just delicious - so I am using that. You need a\ncouple of eggs, some brown sugar, a small little pinch of cinnamon, vanilla, and milk.\nThat's it! You'll also need some melted butter and your waffle maker or your waffle iron.\nI've got mine preheating so it is going to be ready for us whenever we are ready to use\nit. Alright, I've got a little baking dish here and in it I am going to put my eggs.\nI am going to give those a quick little whisk and I am going to add in my milk. This is\npretty much my standard - you know, my standard, what am I trying to say? Please help me - French\ntoast! I'm just, I'm going to make a smaller batch of it. I'm not using three eggs and\nthe full amount of milk. I am going to use my brown sugar and vanilla. I love brown sugar,\nyou could use regular granulated sugar in your French toast if you want to, I have always\nhappened to use brown sugar so that is why I use that. And we also need a small splash\nof vanilla. This is like the flavoring of things. Now, what you can do is you can really\nuse any kind of bread that you want with this. Traditionally, you use an eggy bread to make\nFrench toast like a challah bread or brioche. I've got my honey oat bread that you guys\nhave seen here before and it is just so good because it's sweet yet slightly salty. It's\njust - it's perfect. And it absorbs this just beautifully and its been sitting on the - it's\na couple of days old. So, it's a little stale which makes for great French toast. All I\nam going to do is I am going to take a couple of slices at a time and I am going to just\ndunk them in there and let them sit there for a few minutes until - not a few minutes,\na few seconds on each side. You really want that custard to be soaked up by the bread.\nSo I would say about fifteen seconds on each side. You let it sit and kind of soak it up.\nNow, I am going to do two slices at a time because my waffle maker - the little squares\nare a bit on the smaller side. I just make sure I brush it with some melted butter and\nthis is a heat proof spatula so it's not going to melt. Just make sure you brush it so it\ngives you flavor and it also prevents it from sticking, which is always good. But for anything\nwe just want flavor, right? I'm being greedy here! Shocking, I know. Alright I'm going\nto move this closer to me. I just put it down like so. You can see my slices are a bit bigger,\nbut that's okay. I'm going to close this up and I am going to let that cook until the\nlight goes green. In the meantime, I am going to soak up the rest of my bread. Can I fit\nthis in here? Yes I can! Just taking my last batch - oh look at that. They are amazing.\nThey small amazing. Essentially what you made is French toast but you cooked it in the waffle\niron. All I need right now is some maple syrup and I would be in heaven, but I don't have\nany maple syrup right now so this is going to have to do. I don't have it near me but\nI'm excited. It's going to be hot. Also, what you can do with the rest of them if you don't\nplan on eating them all in one sitting - like tonight it's just my husband and I and we're\nnot going to eat all six of them or five over there. I am going to - How many are there?\nThere's five in total, I can't even count. I am going to just freeze them and then when\nI want them I just take them out and pop them in the toaster or you can even put them in\na hot oven. Either way, you get them thawed and have homemade, you know, waffle French\ntoast whenever you want it. So good! It gets like crispy so it's really delicious and it's\nnot as soft but it's just traditional flavors of French toast but it's got a little more\ntexture to it and a bit more flare. Laurainthekitchen.com will have the recipe written for you. Let\nme know what else you want to see in the waffle maker because there's so many different things\nwe could do with it and I am going to show you other things you can do using it but if\nthere's anything you want to see in particular let me know down below. I hope you've enjoyed\nspending time with me and I will see you next time. Bye! ",

        "content": "Hi! I'm Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert Village\nand today we are going to show you a basic preparation for French Toast. This is a real\ncrowd pleaser as far as the breakfast meals go. I've got some thick sliced white bread\nthat I just got from the grocery store and I am using a knife that has some teeth on\nit so that we can cut through this bread without having to apply a bunch of pressure to it\nand mash it down, so that we get some nice even slices. I am just going to cut these\nin triangles here in half. Behind me on the stove top, I have a non-stick Teflon sautee\npan with some clarified butter and we've shown you how to clarify butter in a previous video\nand I like to use clarified butter simply because it adds a really nice nutty rich flavor\nto foods but it is also a lot more rugged and hardy to heat. It lasts longer and with\nthis particular procedure it will be real nice. I just got a thin layer if you will\ninside the pan, not too much because it's not going to take a whole lot to just get\na nice crispy color on this milk and egg wash. I used 2 whole eggs and a little bit of milk\nin my mixing bowl here. I'm going to throw these guys in. Again the cook time is not\ngoing to be a whole lot on an item like this simply because the bread is done, so I am\ngoing to lower this heat just a little bit. We are really just looking for a nice color\nout of these guys and I've got a fish spatula that I like to use and this is for more the\ngeneral applications such as this. You've got a decent color coming off of him. We are\ndoing okay on that color as well. Again, using the clarified butter is going to add a nice,\nnutty rich flavor to this. It actually provides a lot better color because you've got solids\nin the egg for the milk and egg wash. The butter itself is clarified. So you've got\na nice good golden color on the toast. That only took a little over a minute if you will.\nSo we are going to finish this second side and we will come right back and show you how\nto present this on a plate and how to make it look nice for your guests.

        "content": "hello and welcome to Henry's kitchen where today we're going to be making delicious oven baked french toast french toast was originally originated by the French in the early 6th century and they called it pan perdu which in english translates to lost bread and then later in the 16th century henry v well let's get started first thing we want to do since it's oven baked french toast we're going to preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit we're going to break the eggs you got a little bit of shell in there I like to kind of hold it like this okay so now we're going to add a couple of items to it we have half a cup of milk I don't have any real milk but I have soy milk which should work fine I don't have vanilla extract but I have maple syrup which which you can substitute just a little bit to taste not too much okay and then a little bit of salt and finally the magic ingredient you're going to want to put a little bit of cinnamon in there and that's what kind of gives it its sweet taste and you could put other stuff in there as you get better at it and now you just want to kind of beat it real hard as hard as you can a lot of times that's where people go wrong when they're making french toast they're not beating it hard enough okay now it's time to slice our bread we want to slice it up into manageable slices and a common practice in the Middle Ages was that if a woman wasn't married by the time she was 20 years old that was seen as a crime against religion and then I guess she would be beaten into submission or sometimes even tortured or even executed okay what we want to do is we want to make sure that all of our bread is completely submerged in our batter that we made and you can see that it's absorbing it quite well here okay now that we've completely immersed our bread into the batter we want to place them evenly out on a cookie sheet and we want to give them a little bit of space in between that's one of the things that a lot of people fuck up is that they don't leave enough space so the bread doesn't have enough time to breathe well it's while it's cooking okay we're ready to put it in the oven okay now we're ready to put it in the oven now for the hard part waiting we're going to wait about 20 minutes now and when we're done our reward will be the most delicious French toast that you can imagine so we're just going to wait about 20 minutes right now well more like 19 I guess okay I think it's time to take it out of the oven let's see what we got here they should be supposed to be a little crispy er than that on the outside I'm not sure if well these aren't even warm what the hell Wow are you fuck well I seem to be having a little bit of a problem with my oven so I'm going to use the toaster oven instead and should come out about the same okay so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take our pieces of french toast and I'm going to put them on the toaster oven and I'm the toaster oven tray is a little bit smaller than the regular oven so we're going to have to squeeze them a little bit just to make sure that we can fit them on there and but we're going to go ahead and preheat this thing to 400 degrees okay now that we've put the French toast in the toaster oven we're going to wait another 20 minutes and and it should be ready and it'll be delicious and crispy and cinah me yeah pretty sure I paid that okay I think it's been about 20 minutes let's see what we got well it definitely smells pretty crisp let's see ah shit what the fuck mmm sometimes the breads pretty good just by itself thanks a lot for joining me and tune in next week when we're going to talk about how to make garlic bread you ",

Beat together three eggs and a\nquarter of a cup of milk Beat together. Vanilla is optional but I just love vanilla with everything! Add half a teaspoon of vanilla. I've got a quarter of a cup of raw sugar here and to that we are going to add our cinnamon. This is what's gonna give us all the beautiful cinnamony flavour. Add a really generous teaspoon of cinnamon to this It's really tricky one to say isn't it? \nYou might not use all of your cinnamon dipping sugar but you can always use\nthis when you're making french toast or pancakes this just a beautiful talking\nso we just made are in cinnamon sugar here so it's a quarter of a cup of raw\nsugar and a good heaped teaspoon of cinnamon if you're you're like yours little sweet add more sugar or more cinnamon. There's a link down below for the full recipe so click  through and you can read it and pin it and follow the recipe from there as well as this video. Now we have a cinnamon sugar we are going to heat up our butter, dredge our bread. dip our bread into our egg. \njust very quickly dips in and then you can pop it back on the plate which I'll do here, so they are good to go got a full plate we will just really\nquickly as I said because you really don't want to go soggy and you can see\nhow it was in smaller pieces would get very quickly get soggy and I could fall\napart when they fry crust keeps it even in better shape so\nkeep dipping it through and if you do with the end have any batter leftover\nyou just make yourself an omelette or quickly cut up a bit more bread but\nthis tends to be just enough I'm making cinnamon french toast for us for lunch and the kids are standing by waiting! been trying out different batters and\ndifferent recipes nobody's complaining well have been doing it but now that\nit's just rot I just couldn't wait to share it with you that they also sharing\nin delicious just cover them all in the cinnamon sugar and then just eat them up\nthere they check those out cinnamon french toast sticks look at\nthem close up well the cinnamon sugar is nice and\ncrunchy and sweet on the french toast that is just comfort food and my kids just adore it!

        "content": "hello guys welcome to a tutorial on how to actually make french toast I know the last video I didn't make it correctly and knows its kind of just like a funny video not really funny but he's kind of just like a fail video so here's what you need okay so for one piece of bread I would say two eggs two pieces of bread three eggs cinnamon milk knife and a fork I mean a fork and a spoon and a spatula that's what you needs so far so what I did I just crack the eggs in the bowl here the second I do is add your milk now you don't want to add too much you want to add you want to add just like a maybe quarter cup of milk not not a whole lot so i'll show you how much so that is about how much milk you really only need and before you do all this i recommend let's just go or cousteau we want you to get the pan nice and hot and you want to set the stove on six o'clock so that's directly down it's like medium for lexi lowe pretty low temperature if you see the flame under there it's not very huge and it should help heat up the pan very slowly and you don't want to put in your butter right away but you want to put that in after you're done all this so i just added my cinnamon and so after this step one use a worker whisk or something i ate like four you really want to break up see oak get it all mixed you'll want to mix this a lot now you don't want to just like mix it very quick and then cuz it's not going to be the same you want it all mixed completely mixed as you can see i'm using like a wide bowl here so i can actually fit the bread in it's very useful because if you use district flat bowl then it's not going to really do that for you so break up two yolks first will help make easier to brick whisker mix and you just want to mix this all together and I'll show you what it should look like after it should be almost finished here get that cinnamon syrup now if you added a lot of cinnamon you should get like a dark color it has it is actually brighter than it is on here there's a bit of the glow contrast so that's going to affect the color of it but really it should look more yellow than this as those off Tim should look like this you should have no symbols they should all be all the yolks and does what it should be mixed together now what you want to do is just dip the ranch it just this is um probably easier steps to bring your thread in you know I'm gonna soak that I'll just let that shit and then you want to flip it I'll just wrap it with fans bachelor I guess I don't know so flip it three go just hook it and numb just deploy or you want to put your butter and your butter in your pan so let's check out oh man that's a lot try not that much probably like that much you want to get the pan nation Calvin I love it welcome back on the pan inflation coders you can make sure you do that how they last a coded pan so you want to put your Fred in I don't know just put your your bread with a spatula and something and we want to let it cook for about three minutes and you want to flip it over do with that size for three minutes and then flip it over again for one minute i'll just show you how I do it so basically it's 236 I'm going to let that go for um not too till 239 and I'll flip it and i'll do it for some chill to 242 and then I'll ok what I like to do on this day dress to close it sprinkle a little cinnamon on the top that's just what i did now and as you can see cooking away till 239 and then I'm going to flip it and we're going to do that till 242 that's amounts of three minutes then we're going to flip it around just to cook the inside for about like one minute if anything got inside and also make sure you're not eating raw egg that it's just that extra one minute kind of help I don't I guess so I'm just going to get back when it's running ok so it's two-thirty a heat and it's been sitting here I've also put more cinnamon on top and you should be smelling a lot of egg and that's normal because because some cinnamon didn't really take place yet when you flip it over it'll smell a lot more like cinnamon and it's 239 so i'll flip it let me get back ok so i just flipped it and it's 239 so just let go for an extra three minutes and i have sprinkled a bit more cinnamon on now this is one you want to get out your other ingredients so our section ingredients are other ingredient is icing sugar for like decoration i'll just tastes i guess and then maple syrup ok now i know this is aunt jemima it's not real maple syrup but we're going to use it anyway 240 ok so just turn to 41 i'm going to flip it to go for another one minute so i'll do that so once again once again i've flipped it adds more sprinkled more cinnamon on and now we'll just let it wait til 2 5th 2 42 or 243 so i'll just like go for an extra minute so 242 I'll just let this sit here so get your plate ready so we can plate this thing so did you take it off and put it on to plate yum it is oh ok now

        "content": "Oh hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to share with you a perfect recipe for a weekend breakfast it is a classic French toast it is so easy to do just takes a few ingredients which I'm sure you already have around now let me take you over the ingredients so we can get started you don't need some few slices of bread and I'll talk about this in a minute some whole milk heavy cream eggs a little brown sugar and vanilla extract and a little bit of butter for your griddle and that is it now what I think makes french toast in my opinion as good as it is is when you use the right bread and for me it's either brioche or a challah bread which is a nice this is a challah bread it's a nice eggy buttery bread and it's best if it's a little bit stale it keeps its texture a lot better when you go and cook it and it absorbs the actual custard better but you can use any braid that you prefer and this is just my classic sort of french toast custard and you can dress this up million-in-one ways with some fresh orange zest and just lots of flavorings which as time goes on here Lauren a kitchen I'll definitely be sharing some of my favorites with you now let's get started I've got my grill here pretty preheating over about medium heat and now into my shallow dish here I'm going to add in my heavy cream and whole milk you could certainly do this with whole milk like the whole thing be whole milk but I'm not gonna lie I'm going to have french toast it's gonna have to be a really rich and decadent french toast cuz I don't make it off to this one I do I do like to indulge and the heavy cream just gives it a much better you know texture in my opinion I'm going to add in some brown sugar and the vanilla you can also use a vanilla bean if you wanted to alright and now I'm just going to whisk this all together so what so I have a nice custard that looks good enough okay now I'm going to take a couple slices of the challah bright at a time and I'm going to just soak those for about 30 seconds on each side or until that custard sort of really see through this is a great thing to do the night before and you can just pretty much bake the whole thing like a casserole which I can demonstrate in a future video for you but I'm just gonna let these sit for thirty minutes on each side and then we're getting ready to put them on the grill I know I said 30 minutes but obviously I'm in 30 seconds I'm just too distracted because this just looks amazing alright I'm just going to put these on my butter griddle I just put a little bit of butter on there actually just took stick of butter and just run it right down and that's it I'm gonna do the same thing on this side on these two slices 30 seconds per side and then I'm just gonna cook these for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side or maybe a little less than that you just want to make sure that they're cooked all the way through you don't have any raw custard hanging about and that's it my french toast cooks for about 5 minutes on each side and it's a beautiful golden brown color on both sides and you want to make sure it's fully cooked through because that is well it's really important that just most important part but it is pretty important just gonna set these up oh yeah last one actually no this is just what it's gonna happen oh yeah look at that no one's here to judge me I can see you want to but don't judge me oh yeah this is why I love weekends hmm I'm telling us best french toast my husband won't mind double dipping I promise I hope you enjoy spending time with me girl Lauren leakage comms to get this easy and delicious recipe make it this weekend post a picture on my Facebook or Twitter I don't care I just want to know that you enjoyed as much as I do I have enjoyed spending time with me and my students hi you ",

We have come to the \n place in our relationship where I have to make you breakfast, so stay in bed while we make Burger \n Kings French Toast Sticks. Here we go. We are going to start by cutting our slices of bread into three sections. This is how we are going to make our sticks of course. Now to a large bowl, we are going to add \n in almond milk, energ egg replacer, ground flaxseed, agave nectar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk that all together until it forms a homogeneous mixture. Next we are going to lay our bread into a deep pan \n and pour our almond milk mixture all on top of it. You want to make sure that those slices of bread \n get filled up with that almond milk mixture. So turn it around, flip it upside down. \n Do what you have to do. Lastly we are going to heat a skillet over \n medium high heat. Add in your butter. I use Earth Balance Brand. Of course I have \n the size as big as my head. I am American. We have to be patriotic here people. Once your butter is melted. Start to add in 5, 6, 7 of \n your sticks and let them fry up golden brown as the sun on each side. Once they are done. We are ready to plate them up and eat them. These fried up so crispy. They are so sweet on the outside. Just to start off with, you get all that sugar. You \n are just like ummm. Agave nectar running down my throat. That is excellent. Then you get the crispiness and the \n texture of the bread. And you all know I love bread. I love carbs. I love gluten. Sorry for all \n you gluten free people out there. I love this stuff. It is like Gods gift to me. Personally, nobody else. So you \n take the bread that I love and add nutmeg and cinnamon and agave nectar and sugar and butter and frying and it is amazing. And this is breakfast. This is setting the expectation of the day so high. Like, what will lunch have to be to top this? What will dinner have to be? And don't even get me \n started? What will dessert have to be to top french toast sticks for breakfast. Are \n you kidding me? This is a challenge. But I am pretty sure me and my taste buds can meet it. I think that is it for today. The sugar has me \n a little hyper and I am talking really fast but if you have any comments leave them below. Video responses are always welcome, and I will see you all tomorrow. Bye. ",

        "content": "Goooood morning! I'm Tess and this morning\nI'm making some French toast. It is quick, easy... you probably have all the ingredients\nand it will be ready in 15 minutes. It's been awhile since I shared a\nbreakfast recipe video so, French toast it is! This is a basic and simple French\ntoast recipe and you can find the recipe and the list of ingredients in the\ndescription box below. In a flat dish I have two eggs, and these are jumbo eggs,\nso if you have smaller eggs you may want to use three.  Adding some milk and giving\nthat a good whisk. Next, I'm adding some salt, a little brown sugar and you can\nuse granulated sugar. Not much as I will be drizzling some\nmaple syrup over the top at the end and the sugar also helps give it a nice toasting\nand browning. I'm adding some cinnamon and pure vanilla extract. Giving that\nanother good whisk to get all incorporated. This recipe will make five to six slices\nof French toast. Today I'm using a butter bread. You can use any kind of bread that\nyou like but try to get a nice thick cut bread. I'm dipping the bread in the egg mixture\nand letting it soak for about 5 to 10 seconds. This spread is soft so it won't\ntake long. The firmer the bread the longer you may\nwant to soak. You want the bread to hold its form and not fall apart. You can use any pan  or griddle you like\nbut today I'm using my cast-iron pan. Just coating the bottom with some butter\nand remember to re-butter the pan between the batches of French toast. I\nhave an electric stove and I'm keeping my heat on a low medium and that is between\na 4 and 5. As the French toast is cooking... I will be adjusting the heat as needed. It's only going to take about two to\nthree minutes per side. If you like this simple French toast\nrecipe please remember to hit the LIKE... button and  SUBSCRIBE for future video\nrecipes. Feel free to share this recipe and my channel with your friends and\nfamily. I'm serving the French toast this\nmorning with some fresh fruit, a little sprinkle of powdered sugar on top and a\ndrizzle of pure maple syrup! What a way to start a day! Some\nsuggestions you can put on the French toast is some butter, a little sprinkle\nof cinnamon sugar, you can use some pie filling, any kind of nuts and of course,\nhow about some whipped cream  on top! From start to finish this is ready in 10 to 15\nminutes. A basic, quick and simple French toast recipe. I hope you enjoyed this\nvideo. Until next time, enjoy. And Thanks so much for joining me here in my\nkitchen. You can SUBSCRIBE here for my future video recipes and remember to\ncome visit me on Facebook. You never know what i might be cooking.

        "content": "hi everyone quantumness and welcome back and today we are making such such a cool recipe we are going to cook in a full breakfast in a rice cooker so for this video i have partnered with tiger and they have generously generously provided me with an adorable pink rice cooker to use if you guys watch my cook miss recipes and you'll know that i worked with them twice before to make some other rice space dishes but i thought that it would be so so cool to be able to make a full breakfast in a rice cooker so this recipe was a bit of trial and error if you guys follow me on snapchat then you will know the amount of times that i tried and failed to do this but i have found a recipe that works as amazing and I'm so excited to show you guys so what's this breakfast consist of its homemade french toast of the blueberry maple syrup syrup some breakfast sausages some steamed cherry tomatoes and a ham hash which is made with potatoes sweet potato um two different colors of bell pepper pan and some egg and so if you're having a busy morning or you just don't feel like fussing with breakfast but you want a nice full breakfast this is the perfect recipe for you it is so easy and a ton of this can actually be prepped the night before the French toast might not look exactly like french toast but it tastes almost even better than french toast so let's get started okay so first we are going to making the French toast portion and you can do this whole step the night before if you like so what you want to do is chop some egg bread into cubes and then place the bread in the rice portion of the rice cooker in a separate bowl combine some melted butter egg milk cinnamon vanilla extract and salt then pro-us on top of the bread and mix until the mixture is fully absorbed and so the French toast goes in the area of the rice cooker where you usually put the Reich and then everything else that we're going to making is going to be placed in there to cook plate in this rice cooker so this is what is amazing about this rice cooker because it allows you to cook side dishes as well as the main dish so first we're going to make the blueberry syrup super simple all you need to do is mash up some blueberries and mix them with maple syrup then you want to pour them into a small shallow ramekin or you can make a little dish with some aluminum foil and then place it onto the to cook plates then to make the ham hash play some potato and sweet potato in a shallow bowl and cover it with plastic wrap and microwave them for about 45 seconds to one minute and so you want this to be slightly cooked not cooked the whole way through but just begin the cooking process so that they can cook the rest of the way while they're in the rice cooker then add some diced red and yellow bell pepper some ham and some parsley then season with some garlic salt and pepper then drizzle some olive oil on top and mix well add 1/2 of a beaten egg and start to fully coat the mixture and so what this bean egg does is it adds the eggy flavor without being like this huge amount of egg so it's still kind of tastes like scrambled egg but it's a little bit more balanced in flavor then you want to place this in the to cook plate along with some breakfast sausages and some cherry tomatoes so to cook this set the rice cooker to the cake function and set the time to 45 minutes then press Start the once rice cooker has Spanish cooking remove the took tray and then place the plate on top of the rice cooker pot and using a dish towel because the replica pot is going to be so hot flip the French toast upside down onto your plate and then remove the rest of your pot to reveal your French toast underneath top with the blueberry syrup and serve with some ham hash breakfast sausages and blistered cherry tomatoes and you are done so thank you guys so much for watching I really hope that you liked this recipe I love that you can make something kind of unexpected like this in a rice cooker as well this video is sponsored by Tiger but I genuinely love this rice cooker so much I use it all the time and it's just it's so it's so cool like number one it's pink and number two you can click things like breakfast in it it's so versatile and you can also make cake you can make you can use as a slow cooker even you can make risotto in it there's just so many other possibilities so if you would like me to make some other things in this rice cooker definitely comment below and I can definitely make those and I love you guys so much and I said cookies and a Valentine's Day theme week is actually starting up next week so make sure to check back on Monday for a whole week of Valentine's dippin videos and I love you guys so much and yeah I will see you on Monday bye ",

        "content": "- Hey guys, today I'm gonna show you how to make a really\ndelicious breakfast treat known as pain perdu. Now pain perdu is really\nthe origins of French toast because in French the literal translation is lost bread or day-old bread. This is a great recipe to make if you've entertained the night before and you have a bunch of\nbaguettes laying around that you haven't eaten. It starts to turn hard and you don't know what to do with it. This is a great recipe for that. Now, sometimes in France, you'll see this actually served as desert. But here in the States, you know we love our sugary breakfasts, so it's really good for breakfast too. Let me show you how to make it. So, the first thing we're gonna do is cut our bread into two-inch slices. You can go ahead and just set it aside while we mix up the batter. Then, in a shallow bowl,\nyou're gonna take three eggs, a half a cup of milk,\na tablespoon of sugar, a half a teaspoon of salt,\nand give those all a whisk. Now, we're gonna add some flavoring. So, we're gonna add two\nteaspoons of vanilla and one tablespoon of orange zest. So, this is where I'm taking it a little bit to the American side and adding some nice orange to it. Here in California, we\nlove our citrus trees, so I love to infuse this with\na little bit of orange flavor. So, we're going to take those\nbread slices that we prepared and we're going to place\nthem in this batter to soak. Now, here's the critical part:\nyou really need to make sure that you let this batter\nreally soak into the bread, especially if you're\ndealing with day-old bread, which can be a bit hard. The soaking of the bread is going to actually soften the bread and make it a lot easier to eat. So, I typically will do\nabout six minutes total. So, you do three minutes on one side, then flip it and do three\nminutes on the other side. And then you can go ahead with your tongs and just sort of do the\nsides of the bread as well. While that's soaking, we\ncan prepare our syrup. So, in a little saucepan, you're gonna add two\ntablespoons of maple syrup, two tablespoons of butter, and another tablespoon\nof fresh orange zest. Just let that all sort of\nmelt down and become warm, and then you can keep it on a low flame so that it stays warm until\nyou're ready to use it. Then we're gonna take out\na large nonstick skillet. I think it really works well\nwith a nonstick skillet. You're gonna put a pat of butter in the pan and melt it down. And then once it starts to sizzle, you can go ahead and take that bread and place it in the pan. And once they start to get\ngolden brown on that one side, you can go ahead and flip them. You wanna cook it for\nanother one to two minutes on the other side. And at that point, I\ndo go in with my tongs and just sort of move the bread around, making sure that all of the crust side is also cooked and brown, because remember you\nhave the raw egg on it. So, you just wanna make sure\nthat it's cooked on all sides. Then once they're done,\nyou can go ahead and serve. I like to place these on a\nnice long rectangular platter. Spoon some of that delicious syrup on top. And top with a little bit more orange zest and you will see you will have one beautiful little breakfast\ntreat waiting for you. I love this recipe because it's\nsuch an elegant presentation that is so simple to do. It's the perfect recipe to\nmake if you have house guests that have stayed over the night before and you wanna make something really impressive the next morning, you should give this one a try. I hope you try it and let\nme know what you think, and I will see you back here next week for a really darling little\nidea for Fourth of July. Until then, bye.

(April laughs) - I love it when Justin announces cause he just does it so funny. Yup, we're making French\ntoast, so stay tuned. Let's begin by cracking two eggs. Whisk the eggs and at\nthe same time add milk. Now you're ready to add nutmeg, cinnamon, and a dash of pure vanilla extract. Grab any bread that you like and make sure to soak it both sides. Heat up a pan of oil, and now you're ready to\nfry up your French toast. It usually takes about a minute each side to completely cook. (relaxing music) Now your French toast is ready. I like adding some fruit on top, so I added some sliced bananas. And I love the flavor of cinnamon, so I sprinkled a little\nbit of cinnamon on top. And then I drizzled some maple syrup. And your French toast is good to go. Enjoy! - All right, you ready to try it? - Yes I am. - It's got bananas. You don't have to add bananas, but I just like to add\na little bit of fruit to my French toast. - I love bananas. Oh this looks so good. - Doing the happy breakfast dance. - Mm-hm. That is so good. You know what? I love the-- You know what this feels like to me? - What does it feel like? - It feels like if I go to a restaurant and get like a fancy French toast where they put like fruit on it and cinnamon. - And then the syrup is all like... - No but seriously. You don't really think of, when you make breakfast\nfood at home for yourself, you never really think to\nput a dash of cinnamon on it. It really kind of brings out\nthe flavor of the French toast. And I love the how you made it like mini. - Yeah, the mini baguette. You cut it in little small pieces. - I love that and it's great for if you actually have\nthose around the house and it's going bad and you can use it. - That's exactly what I did. We use left over bread\nfrom like a restaurant. We had bread and so why not? - Yeah I love that. So it tastes great. Thank you so much. - Thank you. And here are some of you friends who have tried our recipes. (upbeat music) Well thank you friends\nso much for watching. We hope you enjoyed this episode and we hope to see you next\nTuesday for a new recipe. See you soon. - Bye. - So I don't know what to call it. Cinnabon cinnamon rolls? - Cinnabon cinnamon rolls. - Yup, so stay tuned, it's so good. Let's begin by placing one cup. ",

        "content": "have you ever wanted to learn to cook but just didn't know where to start well we're the guys from sorted food and we've teamed up with coops great now cooking a free online course to show you how to up your food game so head over to now cook it to get started but for now check out this video from the course [Music] cinnamon french toast it's a cracking treat if you've got guests over if you've got leftovers or if you just hung over we're going to show you how to make it plus an incredible blueberry compote we're going to put with it which basic fact word for warm blueberry jammie thing we're going to start with the custard we need for the french toast so a large shallow dish we're going to crack in four egg and wish them up [Music] you're not really looking to aerate it just to kind of mix up the whites and the yolks together then we can add in milk [Music] a pinch of cinnamon this is ground cinnamon one about half a teaspoon in total and then one tablespoon of sugar sugar has things in it we will come back to the things so this is basically a very simple custard as it cooks the egg set or coagulate and that's what forms an incredible custard so now what we need to do is place our bread in now for french toast you can actually get away with and it's even better if it's slightly stale bread alternatively this is a bit of a favorite of mine I love buying croissants at the weekend Saturday they're lovely and fresh I mean we go through them they're a little bit more sale but if you slice that in half that way a nice serrated knife using a sawing action and you cut all the way through hands on top use that for that to make french toast is also incredible but today we're going to show you with a classic bloomer loaf I mean people are always doing brunch so why not do brunch in your own house this is for the exact is a tree this is definitely a weekend tree is a bit luxurious but it doesn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes to make we just want to place it into the custard and leave it to soak for a minute then we'll turn it over for another minute now blueberry compote something you can skip all together you can just use a jar of jam out of the fridge and maybe warm it up and mix up so it's a bit loose but why would you do that when this consists of three ingredients very very simple brunch item we're going to do is take a pan onto some scales and I'm going to add in 150 grams of our vanilla caster sugar now this is a very expensive ingredient if you buy it as vanilla caster sugar I never do I get a bag of castor sugar put it in a jar with some left over vanilla pods wash it dry it and store it inside of the jar and you get this most amazing fragrant vanilla sugar transformed cakes baking calm pots and jams like this it's amazing so 150 grams how long just believe the familiar English sugar before it starts infusing I mean these Davidian are just keep chopping up the sugar so they've been in there week yeah but a couple of days is enough for it to start next in all of our blueberries these are fresh blueberries obviously but you can use frozen ones and then just a squeeze of lemon juice need about a tablespoon in total so that's going to offset against the really sugary sweet flavor it it also gives you a little bit of liquid to stop the sugar and bluebies burning before I've had a chance to pop and relieve some of the natural kind of juices from within onto a hob up to a relatively high temperature and we want to boil it for four or five minutes to start with it'll take a while to bawl because you need to all those juices to come out yep but then it'll be bubbling furiously and it's good to go slip our slices of bread over just soaked on the other side and look at that cinnamon in there is a nice touch but also if this is kind of wintertime I like a little bit of ground ginger in there very warming for a brunch item it is also a great dessert if you don't wanna do it for brunch or breakfast it's a nice impressive dessert what you need next is a frying pan preheated of a fairly high heat and a knob of butter cooking in butter is pretty much essential that's what's going to give it is golden color as I said it is a special occasion so we can go all out with a little bit about that do not do this every weekend that is our disclaimer [Music] as soon as you're happy your butter is completely melted it's just started to foam on top mm-hmm now's a good time to get the bread in so you want to remove excess dribble egde because you don't want to make them scrambled egg in the pan so just kind of shake it but then that's going to go into our pan and it will need a minute or two on each side you do want a good strong golden color but because it's so thick by the time it cooks you almost get a custard the eggy bit inside which is amazing I cannot pay there we go look how much juice is coming out those lubbers now just starting to boil now we'll start the time about four or five minutes these need flippin so give it two minutes on either side and then we'll drain it on kitchen paper to get rid of all that excess [Music] and there we go a beautiful slices we cut into it you can see why we cut it so thick you've got that almost custody middle that's what you want done is this is best if it's not super super hot let it cool down a little bit and whatever is left you can store and reuse in days or weeks to come in the fridge it keeps really really well we'll finish it with a sprig of fresh mint as well and now you've got everything you need to know to make cinnamon french toast with blueberry compote some awesome flavors going on here blueberry vanilla sugar and the cinnamon oh that's good plus the rich Custance of that bread blueberry compote is fantastic such an awesome brunch if you want to give it a go then make sure you get all the recipe and details down below and send us a photo when you cooked it [Music] ",

        "content": "alright so today we're going to look at how to make one of my favorite breakfast items which is french toast I'm just going to make one piece right now so for one piece you should start with two eggs and each additional piece you want to make adding about one more egg you're going to need a pan of course a spatula some butter I'm going to add a little bit of cinnamon and milk some people will add some other things I might add a little salt 2 i'll show you that as we go and then i really suggest some one hundred percent maple syrup it just is so much better than the other syrups on the market cost a little bit more but you don't have to use as much and it's really good so to start off turn on your burner i set mine to about four out of ten so it's kind of medium low and take you two eggs I already broke mine and I'm not going to mix them too much yet it's going to get them a little mix but then I'm going to add in a little bit of cinnamon like I said people add different things some will add some vanilla I'm just going to add a little bit of cinnamon here lots of people will add some milk some people like majority of people add some milk to this some people won't I add in a little bit of milk though I don't add in too much just a little bit there and then I add in just a little bit of salt like I said some people will make a variation of this like add in some vanilla or some other things so here I'm going to just stir it all up alright that's pretty good and now our pan is heated so now we're going to throw in some butter and actually I'm going to wait one second for the butter I'm actually going to go ahead and just dip my bread you're going to take your bread and just put it in your egg mix let it sit on one side for a second soak up a little bit of the egg and then flip it and let it sit on the other side so I'm going to let it sit there for a second while I get the butter in my pants let that go around here and I actually use a lot of butter i might empty out this butter here let me empty out this butter into my sink so now i've got a nice pan of butter and I've got my bread here ready and as you can see two eggs could probably even make two pieces you need about about one egg per piece so then put your bread in there and you're going to let it cook for a while on each side so we'll just let it sit here for a little bit i'll let the video go just so you guys can see how long it takes to cook and like i said when i mixed in the stuff over here different people will add different stuff to the eggs so you can add and you know whatever you want some people will put powdered sugar on it at the end i'm going to do something with the syrup here most people add syrup it's hard to undo this little stuck with one so i got syrup on stuck some people will add syrup you know cold or heat up the syrup what I usually do is I just cook my french toast here cooking on one side for a while then flip it it's pretty much perfect time there you want it to be a little bit golden brown but not black and you're burned or anything so what I'm going to do is let the other side cook here for a while now just about the same time as I let the first side cook but right before is done cooking i'm going to add on some syrup and let the syrup heat up and cook into it so we'll give it another second here i'm just putting away a couple items while i wait put away the milk in the butter here so this is cold out of the fridge but now that this is starting to cook here just going to give it another second i don't think it's quite done so if i make them with just one or two for myself if I was making two for myself I'd probably use a bigger pan and then I can make two at the same time so if i was making two for myself in the morning right about now when it's just about almost done cooking i would just take my syrup and with mate with a hundred percent maple syrup you don't really need that much like as much as i put there is actually like a really good amount maybe if you get a hundred percent maple it's just a lot stronger than the other servants that are like safe and then I just put that on top and kind of spread it around get it all over and that kind of cooks in the sugar it gives a kind of a caramelized taste but it's still it's all maple sugar taste but it kind of gives it a caramelized stage taste which is nice so you can do that if you try it out if you want and then there we go we have a perfect piece of french toast so anyways just wanted to show that I really like making french toast for breakfast I just wanted to show you guys how to do it and that's my little recipe for it so I family questions let me know and enjoy your breakfast we'll see you guys later ",

Now we re going to add a couple of eggs and give it a robust\nwhisk. Now were going to add a little butter and a bit of oil to a nonstick pan and get\nthat under medium heat, guys. Let the butter melt and now we are going to dunk our white\nbread in the egg mixture and place it in the pan. The longer you dunk, the more mixture\ngets soaked in. Personally I don t like it too soaked. You can use any type of bread\nyou like, it s your kitchen do what you want. So, all we are doing here in waiting for one\nside to brown up, flip and brown up the other side. Then you can top it anyway you want.\nFruit, powdered sugar, maple syrup and butter. I always like French toast with sausage. The\nlink to the recipe is in the description box below. OK, that s about it, Please share this\nvideo guys, and if you want to keep cooking with me please subscribe. You all have a fantastic\nday, Chef Kendra is out. Peace. ",

        "content": "hi everyone I'm rockin Robin from cooking Mexican recipes calm now everybody should start their day with a really good breakfast right so today I'm going to be making french toast and I'm also going to share with you the best bread to use so that you get the best results okay so let's go over our ingredients now the first thing I wanna talk about is the bread because that in my opinion is going to make or break your french toast now I've tried using wheat bread I've used gluten-free bread I've used white bread now and the one that I have found that gets the best results is this one here which is country buttermilk bread and I get this at Costco so we're going to need some of that and we're going to use some eggs obviously we got three eggs here we'll need some real vanilla extract some ground cinnamon and in this picture here I've got a little bit of milk any type will do you know high fat low fat whatever nonfat and we'll need some maple syrup to put on top and then this is the real stuff and we'll need a little butter so first what we want to do is go ahead and cut our bread now you can cut triangles or rectangles whatever works for you I'm going to go ahead and just cut this into Trunk rectangles rather because they're going to fit better in my pan so you just cut your bread and it's easier to work with when they're you know in half slices so now let's go ahead and crack our eggs put them in the bowl I'm going to use three okay so now we're going to go ahead and just whip up our eggs and I'm going to add just a little bit of milk to this and it will help it blend and mix a little better so maybe a teaspoon or so and then I'm going to add a drop maybe a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract all right you see how it changes the color a little bit that looks like just the right amount and you really want to blend this well because I don't want the egg whites to be separate I'm going to take a few minutes to just blend this up and I'm going to add go ahead and add a little bit of cinnamon now just do this to your taste you can even leave it out if you don't like cinnamon I might add a little bit more yeah it's a really nice flavor it really smells really incredible once you add that vanilla and the cinnamon boy it smells great so spend about a minute just blending your eggs really well so now we're ready to start cooking the first thing I want to mention those you're going to need a pan to cook your french toast and now you can use a regular frying pan if you don't have one of these this is a nice flat pan it just makes it easy to get to every every piece of your bread so I'm going to go ahead and start the flame on that and add some butter to the pan this is what's going to make it really really good so I put about a tablespoon maybe something like that and then I'm just going to let that melt and I'm going to spread it around the pan and once it starts to bubble up then I know it's ready to add the bread okay so I'm going to go ahead I'm using my fingers I always do that okay so you can see the butter starting to bubble so now I'm going to be ready to go ahead and start dipping my bread into the egg batter all right give that one more little mix drop your bread in let it soak for a few seconds and then flip it over you want the egg to absorb into that let's fold over on me now okay then place it on to your pan I'm going to get three across in two rows okay so here we go last one in it's better to start with your flame lower than higher that way the egg will cook through so now we just let it cook a little bit until it Browns up nicely and again I've got about a medium medium heat right now oh and the other thing on the mention is let's go ahead a nice little touch is to take your maple syrup and put it in it put it in the microwave for just a few seconds to just kind of warm it up that way when you add it to your french toast it's nice and warm alright so we'll have it just a look see I want you guys to see how it's cooking up so that's getting a little close here and you can look underneath it's starting to get brown but it's not quite there yet and of course our hot spots going to be right in the middle so I'm probably going to rotate these around a little bit so I'm going to give it another about thirty seconds and then I'll probably flip them over okay so let's turn these over look at that nice golden brown if it starts getting too dark too soon you turn it down all right look at that that looks perfect slip them over probably another 30 seconds or so on this side and it'll be done so it's a nice quick breakfast it's got your protein in there your carbohydrates it's a great way to to start your day you see here the bottom nice and brown and these are just about ready just another 5 seconds or so now that one's done okay I'd say it's done you don't want your Heat to be too hot or it'll cook too fast and you won't get the inside done so these are ready I'm gonna go ahead and serve these up my cameraman is going to have a nice breakfast okay so there you have it I'm going to add a little bit of that warmed maple syrup on top my cameraman is just dying to eat this you can't wait alright so there you go and if you wanted to you could add some powdered sugar if that's what you like but it's so simple and it's it's just a great breakfast I mean it smells incredibly good so thanks for watching my video please subscribe to my channel right up there and leave me a comment try this recipe and leave me a comment tell me how you like it alright thanks for watching and we'll see you next time ",

        "content": "good morning health nuts today we are making breakfast on health nut nutrition I am sharing with you guys how to make apple cinnamon french toast it's apple picking season so I thought why not share an apple recipe that you can make after you pick all your apples at the farms and today I'm collaborating with Manitoba harvest you guys know I love them and I'm sharing these new hemp toppers these are great they're basically like the traditional hemp parts mixed with some awesome flavors to add to your meals this one is maple cinnamon it's perfect for breakfast you can top it on your own meal or on top of french toast like I'm going to show you guys today so if you're interested in finding out how to make this recipe let's just hop right in for this recipe you're going to need bread I'm using some fresh organic sourdough bread but you can use any bread that you like eggs unsweetened soy milk Apple maple syrup coconut oil Manitoba harvest hemp heart Stoppers in the flavor maple cinnamon a dash of cinnamon and sea salt and last but not least some vanilla now you'll want to slice up your bread I'm using a sharp serrated knife and I'm just going to slice up some thick Texas style bread slices because I really want that luxurious thick french toast look and feel for this recipe now that you have your bread slices sliced up you'll want to just lay them out on a tray and you actually want to preferably do this the night before so you can let them dry out and kind of get stale if that's not the case you can always just pop them in the oven on like a low temperature just for a few minutes to get slightly dry while you're doing that you can start with your egg custard batter I'm cracking a few eggs into a medium-sized bowl adding my soy milk you can use any nut milk that you like cinnamon and sea salt a little bit of vanilla some maple syrup definitely optional I just like it adds a nice sweetness to it and then give everything a good whisk these eggs are super yellow as you can tell Matt actually just picked these them from a local farmer and they tasted delicious highly recommend doing that next you'll want to get a kind of deep shallow bowl I'm just using this casserole dish pour your egg custard mixture in there and then just start soaking your bread slices in there and you want to let them soak about three minutes on each side depending on how thick they are you might want to do it a little bit longer and I will have all the exact measurements and instructions on how to get the perfect french toast over my blog health nut nutrition CA so be sure to check that out so once they're all nicely soaked you can just transfer them to a plate or pan like I'm doing and then you can just start soaking your next batch and just keep doing that until you've ran out of bread then you'll need a large nonstick skillet you're going to add a little bit of coconut oil and just heat that up on about medium heat once the pan is nice and hot you can go ahead and throw on your french toast and you'll want to cook it for about three to four minutes on each side and you're looking for this wonderful golden-brown kind of pancake looking texture in the same skillet you're going to heat it up with some coconut oil I've just quickly sliced up my apples I've left the skin on a little bit of cinnamon and sea salt a tiny bit of maple syrup and then you can just saute that on low to medium heat for about three to five minutes and then during the last 30 seconds I'm just sprinkling on some of these and part Stoppers give it a a last toss and you're ready to top it onto your french toast time to plate and then top these off with that apple cinnamon topping it's delicious I love the texture and you can just sprinkle on some more hemp parts if you want so that is how you make my apple cinnamon french toast recipe it's so good you guys need to give it a try at your next brunch or Sunday breakfast with your family and friends I have a couple slices here right in front of me I'm going to give you a quick taste well I can give you a taste test I'm gonna do a taste test even though I know it's so good and take a big

        "content": "hey guys today I'm going to share with you a fantastic recipe if you are hosting a brunch or have some overnight house guest it is my crunchy brioche french toast with mixed berries it's a fantastic little treat that will serve a crowd and it couldn't be any easier to put together let me show you how to make it so you first want to create your egg custard I think mixing this up in a shallow pie plate works really well because that will allow you to put several pieces of bread in at the same time so we're going to add four eggs and then three tablespoons of heavy cream now you could use milk if you wanted to I find a heavy cream just makes the custard a bit more decadent but really is up to you and then to that you're also going to add vanilla extract and a good pinch of salt then you can just whisk that all up until everything is combined and set it aside then you want to cut your bread so I'm using a brioche loaf but really any kind of thick egg bread would work well for this and you want to cut some thick slices so anywhere from an inch to two inches works well then you're going to take your bread and place it in the egg batter and then you want to make sure that you give your bread a good chance to soak up all of this egg mixture on both sides that will prevent your french toast from being too dry in the center so I would say two to three minutes on both sides and then in a resealable bag you're going to take two cups of just store-bought cornflakes never brands I like that it works follows and you go put it in the bib lock bag and give it a good whack with a rolling pin to create a nice crushed coarse meal and you can transfer that to a shallow bowl or pie plate and they are also going to toss in a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon so now you have everything ready to go then you're going to transfer your bread into your cornflake mixture and just make sure that all those cornflakes are kind of covered on both sides and then it's time to roll it up and we're going to add in a pad of butter and once that butter is nice and siblings then you can add the French toast and you want to cook it for anywhere from two to three minutes on either side just until it's nice and golden brown and if it gets too Brown not too worried we're going to cover this with some powdered sugar later and some berries so there will be a way to fix it then once they're all ready you can place them in the oven for just about five seven minutes and I do this for two reasons one because we're dealing with such a thick piece of french toast some egg batter might have gone on the side it didn't actually get cooked in the skillet so you do want to put it in the oven to give it a chance to kind of cook all the egg and the other thing this will do is help the top there's already nice and crunchy get a little bit more crispy and it really only takes about five seven minutes and once your french toast is ready to go you can slide it out onto a cutting board give it a nice light dusting with the powdered sugar you don't want to put too much because remember we already put the sugar and the cinnamon in the cornflake so you don't make it too sweet and then you can cut each slice on the diagonal and then I like to serve this all kind of layered up on an oblong serving platter I think it looks really pretty that way and then you can just place those berries on top and there you have it a delicious crunchy brioche french toast that will get lots of oohs and ahhs when you bring this to the table and then you turn serve this with some syrup personally I find it sweet enough although my kids will argue that fact I do like to eat this with some syrup up to you I hope you guys give this one a try and let me know what you think if you're looking for a real crowd-pleaser on Sunday morning this one is it alright you guys I'll see you back here next week for another quick and easy recipe until then I ",

        "content": "Today, we're going to make a great recipe\nfor French toast. It's very quick and easy to make. Flavored with vanilla and rum. Let's go! \nFirst of all, we need to make the mix. It's very simple. \nTo start, break an egg in a large baking bowl. Add half of the brown sugar \nand stir until it whitens. Now add 2 tablespoons of \nNegrita brown rum. This will really add all the flavor\nto the French toast. I often use rum in other types of cake or pancake mixes:\n the rum evaporates but all the great flavor stays in the mix. Especially with brown rum, which is filled with\nsweetness, spices and vanilla. Add 1 vanilla bean. If you don't have fresh vanilla you can use vanilla extract \nor vanilla sugar instead. Ok here are the vanilla seeds. Keep the vanilla pod, you can use it\nto make vanilla sugar. Stir all the ingredients. Mixing in the seeds well. Add 250ml/8,8oz of milk, which you can replace \nwith a little cream if you prefer. Take 4 slices of stale brown bread. It needs to be stale. \nThis is a budget-friendly, economical dish! The staler the bread, the better\n it will soak up the mix, And the softer it will be. -Never throw away old bread.\n-It would be a shame. Use it to make French toast or \nbread and butter pudding... Pour the mix into a shallow bowl. Add the bread; and it will start to soak up the liquid. -It's an important step.\n-We leave the bread to really absorb the milk mixture. That way it'll be nice and soft. The bread we are using is quite stale, \nso it absorbs well. Take 20g/0,7oz of butter, \nbut use as little as you can, since the pan is non-stick. Let the excess mix \ndrip off the bread. It's perfect. Place it in the pan to fry. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top. This will make the outside crispy. Lower the heat. It was high until now, \nnow I'm reducing it to medium. Fry on high heat on one side only. We have a real, nice French toast. It's sizzling. Sprinkle with brown sugar... to caramelize, by frying quickly again on each side. A taste of childhood. It's a great afternoon snack. \nKids love it. I bet! Damien, you showed us how to make great\n French toast. -It smells good! \n-And since it's better when it's hot... -Let's eat it now!\n-It'll be delicious. I hope you're excited to make\n your own French toast. It's a great recipe. French Toast: 250ml/8,8oz of milk, 1 egg, 2 to 5 tablespoons of brown rum, 50g/1,7oz of brown sugar, 1 vanilla bean, 20g/0,7oz of butter, \n4 slices of stale bread. Subtitles: Agathe Fonvieille ",

        "content": "Hey Cookaholics Chef Kendra Here and today\nI'm teaming up with Rosie from I Heart Recipes. We thought we'd drop some cool stuff you can\nserve for Easter Brunch. Heck Yeah, she is hooking up some amazing\nOrange Rolls. So make sure you all go check Rosie's channel. I'll toss up the link at the end of this video\nand it'll also be in the ABOUT SECTION below. I'm offering up some stuffed French toast. So, let's do what we do, head into the kitchen\nand make this happen. OK, we have our stuff waiting for us. I'm slicing some brioche into some nice thick\npieces. If you can't find brioche just use some quality\nFrench bread. However brioche is much better for this dish. This is fresh baked. I'm using a small knife to cut straight down\ninto the bread on the top and I'm going to do the same thing on the bottom creating a\nnice place for our filling to live. Just like so. Speaking of filling we're sliding some cream\ncheese into our bowl and we're going to add some powdered sugar and some vanilla. We're going to roughly mix this together with\na folk, then use our electric mixer to finish the job because we don't want a powdered sugar\nbath, now do we? The smart thing is to use a pastry bag or\nbaggie to pipe the filling in. I'm stuffing these boys with this butter knife. Don't judge me. We're whisking eggs, salt and milk together\nin this bowl for our French bread batter. We have a towel under our bowl for stability. Now we're going to get a pan under medium\nlow heat. Add a little butter and some oil. This is similar to a grill cheese as in you\ndon't want to cook it so fast the inside doesn't get hot and melty. Is melty a word? It is now. We're going to dip our brioche stuffed goodness\ninto our French toast batter and make magic. If you like a really soaked piece of French\ntoast dip it for a longer, if not a quick dip is cool. It's your kitchen do what you want. We've slide in our pan and we're just going\nto cook until it's reached it's golden brown perfection, flip this boy and repeat on the\nother side. We're going to remove it from the pan and\nfancy it up a bit for serving. I'm slicing some strawberries here but really\nyou can have a toppings bar, powdered sugar, maple syrup, honey, blueberries, raspberries,\ncompotes or jams. Be creative, guys. I'm going with, as you can see whipped cream,\npowdered sugar and sliced strawberry. I cut this guy in half so you can see the\ntasting filling poking out. I have a homemade powder sugar video and a\nvideo on how to make homemade whipped cream you can click the links to look at those. Make sure you check out Rosie's Channel, I\nheart recipes. Share my videos and if you haven't already,\nSubscribe. Chef Kendra is out. Peace. ",

Upload a video on time. We're going to be making cheese! Two gallons of whole milk? On no, I don't have that\nmuch milk, even a little bit. (funky music) Anybody want French toast? - (speaks in French)\nTo the people of France for everything that's about\nto happen from this point on. (funky music) - (imitating French\naccent) Bonjour, 'allo. It is me, Hannah, here to show you how the French make French toast. Drinking wine, yes very good. (speaks in French) Poetry. My mustache. It is also Christmas, a Paris, so ... You know. Step one, is your pitiful American bread. It is not good for French toast, it is filled with nuts and seeds. Know you must take your pitiful\nAmerican eggs filled with Omega 3s for some reason. America is so pitiful you\nneed to say these eggs are all-natural and they come from chickens. Hah, ptoo! I just spit on myself. (egg cracks) Le crack Le crack!\n(speaks in French) Oh no, as I look at these eggs\nand I think about the shell I just threw away I am\novercome with, une vie. And I must write poetry to cope. (speaks in French) Oui. We must add le, milk? What is milk, what's milk in French? Milk, lait. (speaks in French) Now into your milk you must add\nthe cinnamon sugar, grinder, because in America,\neverything is so convenient. The cinnamon, sugar, it's\nall together in a grinder, so easy-peasy, so useful for making French toast in particular. It's very, it's pretty\ngood, it's pretty good. This part is the saddest part,\nyou have an electric stove. What is this? Ptoo, I spit on this again. (mumbles in French) is hot, wow! Here is a pan for your pain, French puns! (speaks in French) I feel the butter? Now we take your pitiful\nAmerican bread, ooh! Now we take this and we\nwait for the pan to be hot. Pan, are you hot? You seem hot to me, ah, call me later. Ooh-ahh! Magnifique, just like moi! Ooh, le flip. (speaks in French) But that is not necessarily\nthat bad, it is like life. You find you might come away a little bit burnt, but who cares! Une pour for you, okay. Don't be a fool switch your tool. Le voila, a perfect tiny\npiece of French toast. It is tiny because that is the French way and you don't need to add anything to it because it is cut perfectly. That is also the French way, to never ever make any mistakes. I don't think that's so, again,\napologies to all of France. Ummm. God damn it I love French toast! Oooh lets cover this and shut up. The best way to have French\ntoast is add a little butter and some powdered sugar, some fresh fruit. But none of that is here because\noriginally I was trying-- I was trying to make cheese today, and now we have food, that's French toast. So today's lesson is ... Plan ahead there are some things that are, actually in your control-- To do, boo-boop. Hey guys, thanks so much for watching.

Butterworth's original i think we have some other and the refrigerator actually but I didn't think to look in that if we don't know how does go ahead all of it okay yeah yeah I like to some people put thurs all over the top like Kevin is I like to put mine on the side and dip it in that way i only get as much as I want and I don't like I don't like soggy bread at all at all and you're not getting that without all right it's cooked well no bigger it's not soggy let's get very well my own much better that's delicious that's very very good this is really good and I like this and I hope this explains to you all this is our version of french toast and hopefully the next breakfast video we do we'll do some pancakes oh we can do pay okay sure i'll just see what we consider paying what we conserve ax in kentucky right may not be in the other list missus everything maybe so i hope you enjoyed the video i know a lot of you all like it to see kevin cook and he is very natural at it very talented so anyway thanks for watching ",

3 I think that that's enough I don't know I think that that's enough after that you guys are gonna grab your cinnamon um yeah I'm using ground cinnamon just because I feel like it's going to be easier to blend so oh is that so much i think those two yet whatever you're gonna use the rest of the soy milk cuz i just realized that I really only have like a little bit left so I'm just gonna use the rest of the so I know on this and then I'm just gonna use regular 2% milk somewhere so I move downstairs but I'm not going to look at them okay so there we go so once you make that mixture you're just going to want to start to blend it I mean not one bit Willie put all together so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna start I'm gonna start to heat you know the pan around this big I use these pins because these pants are the ones that are like nice thick so it's going to be way easier to okay so so for this I'm not going to have to put any butter on it but like if you have a regular hand at home you're going to have to put you're gonna have to put butter on it because if you don't put butter on it it's just gonna all stick to the pan is gonna be terrible to get out okay so as you can see i'm not done blending this all together so yeah i'm gonna finish doing this so yeah just to be really bougie i'm gonna use cinnamon raisin bread because why not a little bit more it's just an event right here is right next to the microwave where i was looking for it okay so yeah these slices are actually really small that's what i like about them that i won't have to like eat big pieces so yeah i'm just going to dump them in for a little bit for like at least like five seconds and then after i'm going to take them out and put them on the grill ok guys so i'll now that i brought my laptop charger down and I fixed everything I switched the chart balls because it was like acting up but um yeah okay guys so this is what we're gonna start doing we're gonna start dunking um here let me just like okay so as I told you before we're going to start dunking the pieces of bread into the mixture and then taking it out after five seconds or so okay so this is the type of bread that i'm using this is the type of bread okay so this is we're going to do we're just going to dunk it into the mixture and then we're going to put it into the pan that's why i zoom do okay guys so this is what it looks like when it's on the grill obviously okay and now i'm just gonna flip it because i'm pretty sure that the bottom side is done and i do not want to let it burn oh it came out perfect I've never had something come out this perfect in my life okay that actually looks really good you guys can't lie though it's a bomb this book so yeah I just bring them a little bit of sugar on it because I feel like it would taste better add some sugar on it even already put some sugar on before okay that's life and I'm flipping them until they are completely cooked okay guys I'm gonna put these on plate and because these are done so yes take your lovely plate this is my plate and I'm going to just start putting them on the plate ok guys so as you can see i'm basically done with them i'm just going to get the last one off the grill my pan I mean why do I keep calling this to the grill I'm getting the last one off this is the finished product and this one actually looks pretty good there we go there you have it guys up is just some some in maples here on Jemima if you want to hit me up in sponsor me I'm right here bitch right here bitch wait wait look is my face bro I'm here bitch sponsor me bitch all over them just to want and yeah there we go that's pretty good ok that's why I hope that you guys enjoy making this video I mean making this bomb ass french toast as much as i did because this shit is bomb as fuck it's gonna be bomb spoke alright if you guys liked this recipe let me know in the comments below let me know if i should make more cooking videos but honestly this was fun as hell and I'm gonna make some more because this shit looks good but anything anyways guys um if you guys want to see more of this yeah subscribe like this video share with your friends um and if you guys want my snapchat code I'll pull it I'll put it right here if you guys want my Instagram will be in the description so all my Twitter so yeah make sure you guys follow those videos those ships are 20s out but yeah thank you guys so much for watching bye ",

        "content": "I am a big french toast fan growing up it was an absolute staple in my house because of course it was really simple to prepare and it's made with ingredients you almost always have on hand all it takes is a little bread some eggs it's a milk what you end up with is a breakfast that is filling and comforting and of course super delicious so today I thought it would be fun to show you three tasty twists on classic french toast that you may not have thought up we're gonna get started today with some amazing french toast muffins these have all the awesomeness of French shows but all the portability of a muffin what's not to like about that these tasty muffins all start with some lovely French breads all I've done is cut it into half inch cubes and then transferred it into a zipper bag then I'm just going to prepare a simple egg mixture all I'm going to do is combine some eggs with the milk a little bit of maple syrup for sweetness and some cinnamon now if you don't have maple syrup on hand not to worry you could definitely add a little bit of white sugar or brown sugar to this those would both work just as well we're going to whisk all of this up until it's nice and smooth and then we're going to pour this mixture into the bag with our bread the drier your bread be better it absorbs all of the eggy goodness so I'm just putting it out there I'm going to close the bag and then shake it up until all of the bread is evenly coated then I'm going to let this sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour but overnight is ideal when it's time to bake my muffins I'm simply going to transfer my mixture into a well greased muffin tin take my word for this one there's lots of snice sugar in here now it's gonna want to stick and then into the oven it goes at 350 degrees for between 20 and 25 minutes these muffins are delicious all on their own but if you want to take them to the next level I highly recommend giving my maple glaze a try it's really as simple as mixing some powdered sugar with a splash of milk and a splash of maple syrup all you need to do is whisk that all up and then you can drizzle it over your muffins while they're still hot these amazing muffins are basically like a combination of french toast and cinnamon rolls they're soft and chewy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside I promise you you will not regret making them next up today I've got a twist on friends shows that will take you right back to your childhood they're my PB&amp;J french toast roll-ups and they all start with some PB and some J we're going to start by mixing RPV and RJ I'm a purist so I'm using grape jelly here but you can go ahead and use any kind of jam or jelly lick well you may be tempted to use something fancier the best bread for this job is classic sandwich bread in this case I'm using whole-wheat but you could go ahead and use white if you wanted to so I'm simply going to use a sharp serrated bread knife to remove the crust for my bread and then I'm going to roll each piece out using my rolling pin then I'm simply going to spread my PB&amp;J mixture over each piece of bread and create my roll-ups you can do the same thing with Nutella as a filling with some strawberries would be amazing now that all of my roll-ups are prepared I'm going to get to work on creating my egg mixture once again is as simple as mixing some eggs with some milk and giving it all a good width now it's time to get these babies in a frying pan so I've got my frying pan heating up on the stove into that I'm going to add a nice pat of butter once my butter is nice and melted I'm going to dip each of my rolls into my egg mixture and then into the pan they go I really like to rotate them you times during cooking to make sure they're nice and crispy on all the edges and then if you want to make these extra special I've got some cinnamon sugar happening here and then put them on a plate because he's ready to be enjoyed how fun are these for like a kid's birthday party and by a kid I mean a grown-ups birthday party of course I highly recommend serving them with a nice cold glass of milk finally today we're taking things right over the top with some strawberry cheesecake french toast now this recipe is pretty decadent and I would say perfect for a special brunch it all starts by creating some lovely strawberry cheesecake filling and to do that all I'm going to do is combine some room temperature cream cheese with some finely diced strawberries and a splash of vanilla in my stand mixer I'm going to mix it all up until it's nice and fluffy and then I'm going to set it aside and get to work on my bread for this recipe I'm using this gorgeous sourdough loaf you can go ahead use whatever kind of red you like but this stuff was totally calling my name at the grocery store so I went for it using a very sharp bread knife I'm going to start by slicing off a few thick pieces I'm looking for pieces that are about an inch and a half thick because what I'm going to do is use a smaller serrated knife to cut a little pocket into the center that my friends is where my strawberry cheesecake filling is going to go and we hear just me to feed this filling to our bread and then I'm going to get to work on creating my egg mixture since this is a bit of a decadent treat instead of milk we are using I'm also going to add a little splash of vanilla because of course vanilla is such a lovely complement to strawberry we're going to whisk all of this up until it's nice and smooth and then it's time to take these to the stove I've got a frying pan heating up over medium heat I'm going to melt some butter in my pan and then dip my bread into my egg mixture into the pan it goes and I'm going to cook it on each side until it's nice and evenly browned because these are so thick you kind of want to cook them low and slow to make sure they cook evenly when they're ready they are absolutely bursting with yummy flavor and of course just begging to be drenched in lovely maple syrup I like serving them with some super fresh strawberries and a big tall glass of OJ all three of these recipes are total crowd-pleasers so I hope you will give them a try at home if you do give them a try don't forget to tweet or Instagram me a photo because of course I love seeing your kitchen creations and keep in mind that the full

        "content": "Bonjour mis amis! Je m'apelle Hilah. That is all the French that I know, but today,\nwe will be making French toast because it has been requested by several people. You know who you are, and I am going to show\nyou how I make French toast today, so bon appetit! Okay, here's about French toast. It's a really good way to use up stale bread,\nand so what I am, this is actually very fresh bread that I bought this morning, but I am\ngoing to go ahead and cut it and set it aside and let it dry out just a little bit before\nwe cook it while I mix up my eggs and stuff. So it's basically like you make like sort\nof a custard mix with eggs and milk and a little sugar and you dip your sort of dried\nout bread in that, and the trick is to put like equal parts milk and eggs. You want it like real light and fluffy. You don't want it like egg on toast, it's\nnot like that, it's different. Okey-dokey smokies. I am going to do a couple of eggs, and I will\nsee how far it gets me. So an egg is approximately, get out of there,\nan egg is about a quarter cup of liquid, so I am going to put in like a half a cup of\nmilk. First I am gonna whisk these up, or scramble\nthem, whatever. I want to get it very well mixed. I don't want any chunks of yellow or white. I don't want any segregation in my eggs. Okey doke. I am gonna eyeball it because that's how I\nroll. Okay, now I am gonna put in a little bit of\nvanilla like maybe half a teaspoon, or whatever that was. I am gonna use my little microplane and put\nin about a teaspoon of orange zest. Obviously I have to wash this orange before\nI zesting it, and it might even be this whole orange. Let's see what we have. There, okay, now I will use this very clean\nspoon to put in a couple of teaspoons of sugar which you can leave that out if you like. Okay, here we have our eggy batter, yayyyyyy! Now, I am gonna dip my bread in it. Oooh, I am gonna turn on my skillet and heat\nthat up. I am using a griddle today, not my cast iron\nskillet. I hope it doesn't throw me off kilter. Okay, bread, so I am gonna cook this in butter. That's the way we do it. So I have my thing heating up. I am gonna put a tablespoon of butter down\nand get that swirly around and cover my dealy bopper, and probably could cook two at a time\non this griddle. That looks delightful. Turn it down a little bit to our medium heat\nand then got my bread. I wish it was a little more stale, but what\nyou gonna do, life's not perfect. You know what I am sayin'? Okay, so just sort of dip each side in it,\nshake off any excess, and put it on yo' griddle, and it makes that sizzle sound. Okay, I bet your done. I am gonna flip you. Whoa! It's sliding around. Oh, my God! It totally smells like donuts in here, badass! Donuts are a good smell when you're making\nFrench toast because it means you have a perfect blend of sugar and spices. This is what it looks like when it's totally\ndone. Beautiful! I am gonna eat it. Tres parfait mis amis. Okay, I am gonna eat. Wait, I am gonna turn this one off so it doesn't\nburn. I am gonna take this one off too because look\nhow purty. That's just beautiful. Now, you could put powdered sugar or maple\nsyrup or whatever, but I am gonna just taste the purity of the French toast itself. Wow! Look at that. That is nice. Mmmmm. Mmmmmmm. The orange zest is so nice. Mmmmm. There you go. That's how you make French toast. I am gonna eat some more because I haven't\nhad breakfast yet. Breakfast is the most important meal of the\nday. Okay, check out the website. I shouldn't have done that before I talked. Hold on. Check out the website for the recipe and leave\nsome comments if you wish and I guess that's it. So HilahCooking.com for the recipe and all\nthe information that you need to make French Toast, au revoir! ",

You will need A large, shallow dish 1.0 large\negg, beaten 2.0 tbsp melted unsalted butter 0.75 c milk 2.0 tsp vanilla extract 2.0 tbsp\nsugar 0.333333 c unbleached all-purpose flour 0.25 tsp salt 5 thick slices of challah bread,\nor sandwich bread A large skillet and a spatula Extra unsalted butter A wire baking rack A\nrimmed cookie sheet 2.0 tsp your favorite liqueur Powdered sugar Maple syrup and jam. Step 1. In a shallow dish, whisk together the liquid\ningredients until they're thoroughly blended. For a different flavor, substitute two teaspoons\nof your favorite liqueur for the vanilla extract. Step 2. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ones, and\nwhisk them together until they're fully incorporated. Step 3. Preheat your skillet at a moderate temperature\nfor several minutes, and preheat your oven to 200 degrees. Step 4. Dip a piece of bread in the egg mixture for\nabout 30 seconds per side. Placed the soaked bread on a separate plate,\nand repeat with the other slices. Step 5. Melt a tablespoon of butter in your skillet,\nand place the bread in the pan in a single layer. Cook on each side until the bread is golden\nbrown. If you can't fit all your bread into the skillet,\nmake multiple batches, adding a tablespoon of butter for each new batch. Step 6. If you're serving a crowd, you'll want to\nkeep your already-cooked French toast warm while your new batch is cooking. Set a wire baking rack on top of a rimmed\ncookie sheet in the oven, and place the cooked slices of toast on top of the rack. They'll stay warm without getting soggy. Step 7. Top your French toast with a dusting of powdered\nsugar, a pour of syrup, or a spoonful of your favorite jam, and enjoy! Did you know In France, French toast is called\n_pain perdu_, which means \"lost bread.\" ",

        "content": "We're Adam and Joanne from inspiredtaste.net and welcome to our kitchen. We're going to show you how to make french toast -- it's really easy. You will need 4 eggs - just crack them into  bowl. Measure out a half cup of milk... and a quarter cup of cream... then add them to the eggs. Next, add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt... Whisk everything together until well blended. Cut eight, three-quarter inch thick, bread slices... We like to use Italian or French bread for this. Also, try to use day-old bread... it will soak up the egg mixture better than fresh bread. Line the bread slices up in a large baking dish...it is okay if they overlap. Then, pour the egg mixture all over them. Move and flip the bread around so each slice is completely moistened... You shouldn't have any egg mixture left. We usually end up making this in batches. To keep the cooked French toast warm... we preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Now it's time to make the French Toast. Heat a heavy, large pan or griddle... over medium-low heat. Then melt a tablespoon of butter in the pan. Working in batches, transfer a few slices of the soaked bread to the pan... and cook until golden brown and cooked through... this takes two to three minutes on each side. Transfer the cooked French toast to the warm oven while you cook the remaining bread slices. Add additional butter as needed for each batch. Also, if you notice the pan is getting too hot... reduce the temperature a little and watch for the French toast... it may cook a little quicker during the second or third batch. And that's it... Top with your favorite French Toast toppings and enjoy! ",

started alright first thing obviously I'm going to need a batter for my bread so what a pie plate here I'm just going to crack in two large eggs and do better than I did and try not to get shells in your eggs no one likes crunchy bits in our french toast I'm just going to crack those two eggs new up high plate and using a fork I'm just gonna break these up a little bit before I add the rest of the ingredients the reason I'm using a pie plate here is for when I go to coat my bread it's just easier to do it on a wide shallow bowl to my eggs I'm going to add in a quarter of a cup of milk you could also use cream or half-and-half if you're feeling it decadent I'm going to add in one teaspoon of granulated sugar as well as 1/8 of a teaspoon or quarter teaspoon of cinnamon just a pinch of salt maybe an eighth of a teaspoon or so and just a quick splash of vanilla try and use real vanilla extract though and using a fork I'm just going to whisk these ingredients together just make sure that all the eggs are completely smooth the milk kind of helps break up those eggs you don't want to need globules of egg on your french toast you want a smooth batter so I just whisk that well and let me just talk about bread for a minute here I am using Texas toast Texas toast is just regular sandwich bread but it is actually kit cut thicker than a regular sandwich bread it's kind of a dry bread crummy bread and these particular slices are about three quarters of an inch thick and that's exactly what you want you want a thick bread for this I'm just using this regular sandwich bread you could use brioche if you wanted to or French bread you know whatever kind of bread that you like I just happen to like just plain old sandwich bread it just it makes the best french toast to me now I've got a frying pan over medium-high heat here it's actually between medium and medium-high I'm going to add in about a teaspoon of vegetable oil as well as just a little pat of butter now the reason I add both vegetable oil and butter is because I like the flavor of frying and butter as well butter kind of has a natural nonstick property to it but the vegetable oil raises the burning point of the butters the butter doesn't burn because you definitely don't want burned butter on your french toast well maybe you do but I don't so that's why I do both and you want to make sure that your butter and oil are hot before you add in your first piece of french toast otherwise your french toast is going to stick and you don't want it to stick and you know when it's ready when the solids the milk solids in the butter start to brown I don't know how well you can see this in the video but they're just starting to turn golden that is the exact time that your pan is ready for your french toast so what I'm going to do is just kind of mix up my french toast my batter mixture a little bit here make sure that the cinnamon isn't you know sinking to the bottom and dump your bread just really quickly on one side flip it over get it coated on the other side let it drip a little bit and then add that to your pan now a lot of recipes for French toast call for you to soak the bread I do not like soaked bread for French toast maybe you do I don't I like my french toast to not be custardy I like it to still be bread in the center so I just do a light coat on both sides and I'm just going to let this go for a couple minutes until it gets nice and golden brown on the bottom don't be tempted to move your bread around you know just let the pan do its work but the heat do its work you know when you're getting ready to flip when the bubbles around the outside get a little smaller and they don't pop so aggressively so go ahead and take a peek make sure that it is nice and golden brown and then you can go ahead and flip it over and cook it on the other side again just cook it for a minute or two just until those bubbles around the outside kind of simmer down and then you can go ahead and remove that off to the plate add just a little bit more butter and vegetable oil to your pan between each slice and continue frying up the rest of your french toast and this mixture using two eggs will do for me personally six pieces of Texas toast which is just perfect for me and my roommate so yeah just go ahead and keep french toasting all of your bread pieces and then you can go ahead and or some delicious maple syrup right over top if you're feeling extra decadent that's the top with a little bit of powdered sugar if you'd like you can serve these with fried eggs and bacon on the side or if you want just like a little bowl of fresh fruit would be delicious but yeah like I said sometimes it's better just to keep things simple and french toast is one of those things so go ahead and give this recipe a try if you do and you like it go ahead and let me know down below in the comments if you like this video be sure to give a thumbs up subscribe for more deliciousness and

        "content": "the nice thing about using this french bread is it's pretty dense as far as the interior of the bread goes so it does have the ability to soak in a lot of that custard drain off your excess custard don't waste this just put it right back in the bowl because we'll make as much french toast as we can out of this amount of custard and onto a grill should hear a little sizzle telling you my grill is nice and hot with french toast I'm looking for a very crisp outside with some color and I want the inside to be nice and tender if your grill is warm enough it should actually fear the side of the grill I'm sorry see other side of the bread that's sitting on the grill and just sort of gently steamed the inside of the french toast so you have that nice contrast between between crisp edge and really nice tender Center so again in the custard that was just about ten minutes not ten minutes 10 seconds per side let the excess drip off I'm going to test the first piece that I put down it should not stick that's the first thing and you should have some nice color if it's still sticking to the grill it's not ready to turn and that's generally a good lesson for any type of grilling certainly if it's animal protein if you're growing a piece of fish you're grilling a piece of chicken it should not stick if it's still sticking it's telling you it's not quite ready to flip over yet so give it time be patient and flip it when it's no longer sticking to the grill so with these this has probably been about a minute I would say it's going to be a total of about three minutes with this thickness of bread remember over here we've got our ginger berry fruit compote just a little bit of ginger a little bit of lemon zest some white sugar and about a pound of mixed berries use your frozen berries in this case unless you have a lot of fresh berries on hand this is a very good use for your frozen berries and all we're doing at this point in time bringing everything to a simmer and I'm just going to look for the fruit to start to break down a little bit I do not want to make what looks like preserves or jam so I want to make sure we can still identify the berries don't overcook your compote and a little spoon of the compote on top of a warm slice of french toast or a warm pancake or even a warm waffle is really wonderful you can always infuse maple syrup with berries you have some nice pure maple syrup thread into a saucepan toss in some blueberries and strawberries some raspberries and just let them break down a little bit and then you have some really nice flavored maple syrup to use exactly as I would use my compote so we look back to the grill here you can see two pieces got a little darker than the back to this is just telling me that the grill and the fun so the pot spot spot that's closest to me is a little hotter than the back which is fine I'm just going to pay attention to these two slices and they're going to come off first while you're waiting for the last pieces to come off the grill get your remaining bread in the custard so it has a chance to absorb these still have not quite enough color so I'm going to keep those on and I will proceed on that hot spot on the grill and finish cooking off the remaining slices of bread that I have as far as planning I would say you know for a slice of french toast about like this three slices per person just to give you an idea of how much you need to make I on the other hand could probably eat about six slices what I would say the average person would eat about three because these are not very large my compote has come to a nice simmer fruit has begun to break down I'm at this point in time I'm going to turn the heat off like I said the white sugar reacted with the natural sugar and the fruit it produce its own syrup so I didn't have to add any liquid to that and that can just sit in the warm pan and stay nice and hot for service this point in time i'll pull deep again no sticking it did not resist the turn so i know these are ready to turn and i've got a nice amount of color yet to know your grill pans they're all different they all work differently some have incredible hot spots that you need to pay attention to and some are just perfect if you have one of those electric griddles a lot of people really enjoy using those absolutely fine whatever works for you at home if it's a new grill pan don't get frustrated practice with it assume that things are not going to be perfect right away just because it's cast iron it needs time certainly time to season but it also takes requires a little bit of practice so I have very nice color on both sides ready to come off the griddle again just like the pancakes for the waffles if you're making you know serving six people make them in batches hold them in a warm oven preheat your oven to about 200 degrees throw them on a cookie sheet and you can just cover them with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm so where everyone gets to eat a hot waffles hot pancakes hot french toast at the same time here I have a plate of beautiful french toast waiting for my ginger berry compote what could be better for brunch I am Michael Montgomery from The Culinary School of the Rockies hope you learned a little bit about some brunch staples ",

        "content": "we have a ton quite literally a ton there are 100 extra website videos that you haven't seen yet so we're taking our very favorite and putting them on YouTube for you this is our fruity french toast if you're looking for a cheeky bunch then this berry french toast is perfect for you this fantastic breakfast or brunch dish is infused with orange and vanilla and it will make a custard with our eggs milk and sugar will then fry off our french toast itself and serve it with some fresh berries those orange segments and some natural yogurt as well okay but start off with the orange which is going to call flavor the entire dish or need you to do is this into our bowl this is a nice version this is my volition not necessarily D version okay imagine all sorts of recipes our twist the orange is one of those you have a little twist is a little bit of vanilla essence okay so just a tiny drop of that and then we need to make like an egg custard so actually we tend have a slavery version in the UK eggy bread which you might know of this is a sweet version but what do need is three eggs one two three a splash of milk just to let that down so it's not too viscous and I said it was sweet and it's already got the vanilla of the orange in there but it also needs about a teaspoon of sugar and breakfast brunch goes this is quite a naughty one is more of a special training it yes it's certainly sweet and but then you can have pancakes you can have things like this as well you said to have all chocolate based cereals and things it's not you know it's not unusual not every day one but it's not every day one a special occasion if you've got someone to impress your passion weekend a great time for this and then all you need to do is use up some stale bread okay so once you give it a quick whisk take slices of bread okay that are already observing the last legs stale bread is better than fresh bread if it's Cajun dish if you can just dump that in there so it absorbs a fair amount of it another butter into our pan and as soon as that starts to foam then we can start to fry off our bread so since you're going to do is fry both sides and the egg will kind of set and go gold and crispy but it's infusing that orange of vanilla so loads of fantastic flavors now that butters foaming make sure you've got plenty the eggy mixture on there and then into the pan and we just want to start that to fry a minute or two on each side while we're waiting for that yep we can do the bit we're gonna serve we don't waste the rest of the orange have you ever Sigmund orange before no teach me I'm going to we're going to take the top off and then the bottom huh and then cut around and then we can actually take the segment's out so you want to cut it in segments without the kind of membrane a bit between it divides them okay so you end up with just very clean segments and all need to do is cut down into the segment's you can see those lines yeah and there we need to just cut down either side of it so in like that and then like that very gently because you are cutting George hand but only ever towards the center the orange what you're left with are these fantastic segments okay without any kind of bits to get stuck in your teeth any pith if you can do the rest of those add them to a bowl with some other berries then we've got blueberries and raspberries these actually came out the freezer so these were ones we had left over from another recipe now it's had a couple minutes on that side so we can flip it over and do exactly the same on the other what you're looking for is that nice kind of golden color with the egg starts to cook caramelize French toast the recipe I always buy for masses of people again because sorry it's so easy once you've got the mixture in you can make as much that's possible you go in with another slice and as soon as this one's done you start with another and you can have several pounds on the go and you're right it's kind of family friends weekend brunch kind of thing I think it was supposed to trick everybody I'm thinking I was a pro chef because or how simply is so simple I wasn't it was decorative of a few fuzzy berries I thought all the chef's sorted there you go yo simple food that impresses so all those segments are looking great give it a quick stir up and already we can serve at one portion while we wait for the others to cook to take our bread out you have any excess butter and pop it onto our plates I like a little bit of natural yogurt on this cuts through the sweetness keep it in the breakfast theme and then plenty of our fresh berries and you can never be too generous pile it up high rather than across is usually better and a sprig of mint because it might not be deserved it's definitely sweet brunch so there we go our berry french toast sorted hmm okay bit backwards bit tastes good for you cuz the fruit because there's SCS as well oh it's not because it's not that bad except for the butter on the pan nothing that it's just eggs milk and bread you got the fresh berries and the orange to cut through that richness you taste that vanilla ",

        "content": "hi guys welcome to my recipe book with me tareka you know so I look forward to Christmas morning all year round because that's the time that I can enjoy a really nice chilled out breakfast with my family and that's the time that I love making my french toast recipe so you know I don't know about you but I tend to overdose on cakes and cookies at Christmas time so which is why on Christmas morning I like to make a savory french toast not a sweet one just to combat all the sweetness that I overdose on it's really quick and easy and I'm going to show you how to make it you'll need some eggs to start with I've got two eggs here huge eckrich opening you know that's the thing you should always have it at room temperature it will cook nice and evenly same for the milk about half a cup of milk that aside now I'm just going to start flavoring it so I've got some fresh coriander I'm going to use a bit of cumin powder cumin powder is jeera powder and India I'm going to add about one tablespoon of dried chives but if you are using fresh chives use about two tablespoons yeah this will give a really nice and mild oniony flavor without leaving that your aftertaste I need to season this pretty generously with salt get a good few grindings of fresh black pepper okay that should be good on the pepper I don't want to overdo it either and now we're going to whisk this we're going to break up the egg and get everything mixed together really well but don't over whisk it you don't want an over whisk custard and that's it we're done with this now I'm going to get on with making the toasts so now I'm just going to heat up this band got some olive oil now since this is a nonstick pan we won't need much oil I just want to spread it around and while that pan is heating up I'm going to get the toasts ready so this is just regular bread that I'm using regular everyday bread but if you want to use any fancy bread you can do that too I'm just going to dip this in the custard so you want to use slightly stale bread about a day old or so not fresh bread because that will break up completely in the custard will just get mushy and disgusted that we've made a slightly old bread about a day old we'll just soaked it up enough and you want to pull it out before it breaks up and falls apart so now I'm just going to put this in the pan which is nicely heated so you wanna place it on medium-high heat and as soon as it starts to turn brown on one side that's when you just want to this is so beautifully brown it looks gorgeous and now you want to let it cook on the other side so now I'm just going to continue slicing up some more bread okay I'm just going to check it on the other side that skipped over yep it's nicely browned which means this first batch of french toast is done add a little bit more oil and just continue cooking so this is my favorite recipe for savory french toast I usually pair it up with some ketchup that's the way I like it but my crew tells me that they like it with some fresh mayonnaise so I've served it up today with some mayo as well so I hope you try this recipe just a little something to spice up your Christmas morning if you like this recipe like this video and share it with your friends that's what you're supposed to do over Christmas right share all the food that's cooked see you next time guys ",

        "content": "hello and welcome to cooking lessons for dad my name is Karen brayer and today we are going to make a delicious french toast the ingredients in this recipe are eggs milk of your choice you could use regular milk soy milk almond milk I have almond milk ground cinnamon vanilla salt and your choice of bread slices I chose a really healthy grain bread for this recipe but you can use any kind you like if you use a thicker bread it will take longer to cook a thinner bread cooks faster and also we need cooking spray and that's it so the first thing that we need to do is we need to whisk together our eggs milk cinnamon vanilla and salt at Exley almost all the ingredients so I like to crack my egg separately before I add it to the large bowl in case I get shells or something it's easier to get out of a small bowl alright so next I'm going to go ahead and wash my hands before I move on to the next step okay so next I'm going to go ahead and add three quarter cup of I have almond milk but you can use any milk then we need one teaspoon of ground cinnamon you can add more or less to taste 1 tsp of vanilla and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and I only have a quarter teaspoon spoon so I'm just going to use half all right so now we need to whisk the ingredients together and you could use a whisk or a fork and I'm going to go ahead and use a fork you want to just whisk it to all the ingredients are smooth and blended okay our eggs mixture is pretty well blended and smooth so next we need to spray or skillet or griddle with a cooking spray and I just have skill it next thing we need to do is heat the pan to medium-high and if you're using a griddle that's about 375 degrees so we're just going to wait till the pan gets hot enough and we're going to test it by dropping a drop of water on it to see if it dances when it does it's ready for our french toast while our pan is getting hot we're going to go ahead and put the bread in our egg mixture so stale bread is better but you just need to dip it on both sides if you're using a thick bread you might need to soak it longer okay you know the griddle is hot enough when you put a drop of water and it sizzles okay it's good so we're going to go ahead and put our french toast and you might want to bring the bowl close to the pan so you don't drip and you can have other french toast soaking while that one's cooking you can also have more than one pan going you can like I said use a griddle and cook a whole bunch out one time so we're going to cook it until about four minutes on each side until it's golden brown so we'll check it in a couple minutes and see how it's doing okay when I check how it's doing on the autumn let me go ahead and flip it it looks pretty golden looking good I think it's done i'm going to go ahead and try it you can cook it to your desired doneness okay and then we can add more and keep cooking them if you want to keep them warm in the oven you can put them in the oven at 200 degrees put them on a cookie sheet single layer and you can keep making them and keep the other one too warm while you're cooking them so this smells amazing it was very easy a few ingredients mix it together dip the bread cook it you can do it and it's fun to put different toppings on it I have a pineapple orange sauce that I made in another lesson I also have another lesson on fruity fruit sauce the crockpot pineapple sauce they're all delicious on french toast I like peanut butter almond butter you can tell me what you like to put on your french toast ok so the best part is trying it all right delicious mmm this is amazing you're going to love it try it this week right ",

Make sure the chopsticks scrape the bottom of the bowl to avoid creating unwanted foam. Add the sugar. And stir to dissolve. Then, add the milk and the vanilla extract. Combine all the ingredients evenly. You can also use soy milk instead of the regular milk. Place 2 and a half centimeter thick slices of baguette in a tray and pour the custard mixture over them. Make sure both sides are completely soaked with the custard mixture. Let the bread sit for 3 to 5 minutes. This is Kuromitsu, sugar syrup made from kurozato also known as black sugar. It is rich in flavor and often used in wagashi, traditional Japanese desserts. And now, with tongs, squeeze each baguette and then flip it over. The squeezing will help it absorb the custard mixture quickly. Then, let the bread sit for about 5 more minutes. Now, let\u2019s make the French Toast. Heat the pan on low heat and add the unsalted butter. When the butter is completely melted, place the baguette slices into the pan. A tip to presenting a beautifully browned surface is to toast the top side first. Cover and cook on low heat until the bottom is deliciously browned. Now, flip them over. Mmmmmm. This looks so delicious! As for the other side, cook on low heat without replacing the lid. When both sides are golden brown, arrange the French toast onto a plate. The strawberry looks great as a garnish but orange or kiwi fruit can also be used. Spoon the ice cream next to the french toast. Sprinkle on the kinako, roasted soybean flour. Finally, drizzle on the kuromitsu syrup. Jaaaan! We recommend soaking the bread with the custard mixture for no more than 10 minutes to give the inside a gooey texture. If soaked too long, the inside becomes soggy. The combination of the crispy outside and the gooey inside makes the French toast very delicious. Good luck in the kitchen! ",

        "content": "today on Nicko's kitchen such a tasty heartwarming dish that's easy to make we're making my french toast bake so this french toast bake is just so amazing so easy to do and perfect for when people are staying over and you want to make something really tasty and very easy for breakfast so just into a large bowl I'm going to be adding in some eggs and to the eggs I'm going to be adding it's brown sugar and the brown sugar really gives it a nice caramelization if you want to use white sugar you can go for that too of course I'm going to be adding in some vanilla extract and I'm also going to be adding in some mixed spice which is nutmeg cinnamon and a little bit of allspice you don't have to do this this is optional but it really gives it a nice spice flavor so just using a whisk we're going to give this a good mix around get everything combined there now that's how mixture done and for this next step it's best to pop this into a Pyrex jug or a container that you can pour so what we've got here is a large baking dish and I'm just placing down some white thick crust bread now you can use a brioche if you wanted to the brioche will be a little bit sweeter so you don't over sweet but if you want to use it that's fine any bread that you've got laying around make sure it's a day or two old it's not too soft and just place it down and this is why I said put the mixture into a jug we're going to just pour over some of the mixture you can see what we're going to do here we're going to be layering this up and pushing that bread down so just pour it straight over the top and then more bread over the top layer it up and continue that process and then lastly what we're going to do just over the top just sprinkle some more of that brown sugar and that will caramelize on that bread when we bake it in the oven and also just a few more dusts of that mixed spice over the top as well now let me tell you that is a real treat now before we pop it in the oven we're going to just pop it into the fridge for about an hour then we're doing that just to let everything congeal and set and all those flavors soak into the bread and just cool down before we put it into the oven you could do this the night before also and leave it in overnight if you wanted to have it for the next day but pop it in for at least an hour into the fridge and then we can bake this bad boy off place into a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown dust with icing sugar or confectionary sugar and serve now all we have to do is get stuck into this bad boy I love this dish I think the simplicity of it is fantastic and like I said it's perfect for when people are staying over you can make it the night before breakfast is ready to go all you have to do is pop it in the oven and you've got a nice breakfast to go with some coffee or tea or whatever you wish it is a little on the sweet side if you want to make a savory version go for it you can put some hand through there obviously don't put in the the sugar but instead of icing sugar or confectioners sugar on the top you can put over some cheese it's completely up to do up to you so you could do a savory version if you wanted to but in any case give this one a try it is so delicious you will not be disappointed I guarantee it you ",

        "content": "hello lovely youtubers it's Miranda Valentine editor of the lifestyle blog everything sounds better in French and today I'm going to show you how to make quick french toast this is a super simple version and you're just going to love it now french toast is so simple and the perfect way to kick off a breakfast or a brunch so it just takes a few minutes I've got all of our ingredients laid out here in a few minutes you are going to be a french toast making aficionado so here are our ingredients we have two slices of bread now the key to not having a soggy french toast is to using slightly stale bread white bread tends to work fast if you use like a challah or a sourdough or maybe like a day-old French bread that works really really well but if you want to get some extra whole grains in you can certainly use like a whole wheat bread like I have here today but if you can let it go a little bit sale kind of the better your product will be but it's not necessary we also have here a quarter of a cup of milk or you could use light cream or even cream if you want a really super creamy texture now we have one egg slightly beaten and 1 tablespoon of butter that's it and then these little guys over here just you know optional for later we have a little bit of maple syrup and some pretty pretty strawberries that we're going to top it with so to start we're gonna put our slightly beaten egg in here with our milk and with a fork we're just going to mix these together until they are combined and I'm doing this in like a shallow dish that's wide enough because I'm actually gonna dip my french toast my bread right in here now look at that beautiful light creamy color check out our skillet over here you want to use one that's large enough where both pieces of french toast preferably can fit in this is just one serving so if you can do it all at once to eat it when it's nice and hot you'll be really happy so it's not I'm too high because we don't want our butter to burn which is our next step so we're just going to pop the butter in here let this melt and while that's melting we are going to put in our first piece of bread into the mixture so just do a little bit of this kind of mix it around you want to make sure that it soaks all the way through to the sighs you don't want just dry bread in the middle and if you're using a whole-wheat bread that's really important it's much more dense than a white bread is you want to make sure that it's really getting all the way through then I recommend just holding it up so any excess can drip off let's check out how we're doing over here give this butter a nice turn in the pan stand to turn my heat up like a tiny bit more okay perfect now we're gonna let this go in here and it's going to cook for about two to three minutes until golden brown and then I'm going to flip it over to the other side and do the exact same thing okay so my french toast has cooked for about two to three minutes on each side let's turn off the heat check out how golden-brown delicious they are now a little hint is if you want them to have that really yummy buttery flavor and get nice and brown like this definitely cook with butter like we did instead of margarine now with French toast you could just do a little more butter if you wanted you could do maple syrup like I'm always a huge fan of and just drizzle that over beautiful and I also like to do a little bit of fruit you could do blueberries really any kind of berry or fruit your heart desires I think strawberries are just classic and so tasty and I think strawberries are the perfect accompaniment to this french toast thanks for watching make sure to subscribe and if there's something that you want to learn how to make send me an email at request at Mahalo calm and don't forget to check out our other great videos you ",

        "content": "we can only cook it up really simple really fast snap today I mean this is great this note you can have it if you got to be able sweet too if you can have it for breakfast in the mornings or otherwise just as a snap whenever you fancy it because the only takes 10 minutes to actually make the whole lot and and also it's so cheap to make I'm just going to run your food ingredients we're going to use first of all we've got the bread there now I've just got a couple of sticks of bread two or three days old doesn't have to be fresh bread you can use any bread you want really so I'm just going to slice these up Dively to make them look a bit pretty then we're going to soak the bread in milk so let it soak up all that milk then we dip it into some beaten egg fry up in the frying pan turn me over get it a nice golden brown color and then finally we dip it in some sugar and cinnamon powder that's been mixed together and it is finger licking good now just go cut the bread up and so you can just do it I'd say about an inch thick for each one really it doesn't matter too much alright so and again this one if you wanted to you can just cut it along there like that I mean you can make as much of this as you like you haven't got to make all this you can just make a small amount if you want so I've got those ready I'm just going to put those into a little sort of pain and I'm going to pour some milk on so they soak up all that milk so I'm just going to the bread just in the bottom there I'm just going to pour milk over the top of that lot so we just leave that a soak it up a little bit and I might just turn them over if we need to or add a bit more milk is it salt or get sucked up now just lift that for a few minutes so I'm just going to flip them over so we get it nicely coated on both sides let's be careful notes or break them up because they are when I get a bit soggy they get a bit soft so I'm just going to turn them over and try and soak up what we got there so I'll just turn those I'm fat and I'm just going to use a tiny little bit of milk just to go over the top so while something mate waiting for the bread to soak up the milk I just put that aside and we're going to get on with beating the egg a season the egg just a bit of salt really and then just going to beat the egg just trying mix it all together really just for a mere side do that before if you haven't got one of these there you go odo so now I've got the eight down and we've got the the bread in the milk we're ready and let's get on with the cooking so we're going to get on with the cooking in first of all I'm just going to pour in fair amount of oil so let's just get a few good glug the lane now you can use any oil for doing this but you want a fair amount in there because don't forget and thickness of the bread you want to kind of cook halfway around each side so you can flip it over going to turn the heat on i'm going to start it off roundabout sort of medium heat because you want it fairly hot so that when you put the egg bread in there it kind of forms a coating quite quickly you don't put it in on to lower temperature of eyes I think the bread class sucks up the oil and I'm just putting in the bread into the egg like that and we just keep doing that with all of those and I'm just going to pop them into the oil make sure it's hot enough first now we go a little bit longer yet get it a little bit hotter I'm going to give it a go now so straight from the egg straight into the right side again pop another one in there and I'll just carry on doing that with all the rest you might not get them all in the same pan you might have to do it in so three or four pound falls and again if you need a little bit more egg you can always just add another egg in I'll just let those cook away really just for a minute or two on one side and then I'm going to flip them over so I'm just going to quickly flip it over start get a nice golden brown color and again you can flip them one more time if you want me to us back together that's it got more flipped over make sure the heat high enough you don't eat too low so now I've got those cooking away I might fit from one more time but now what I'm going to do is make up the sugar and cinnamon sort out a dick now if I'm making a dick you can just use sort of any white sugar early then and again some cinnamon you want a fair amount at cinnamon and you almost want the color to be a sort of brownie color so I've got me bread that we sort of fried up in the pan with the egg on it so I egg bread if you like and it's got a lovely golden brown color right so let's pull those aside and we literally just pick one of those just dip it in right there give it a shake and you've really got it all ready to go now let's just try this hmm oh nice and moist in the middle where it sucked up all that milk firm on the outside hmm like cinnamon and sugar lovely lovely combination now it's absolutely gorgeous so I just dip those last ones off so I thought I just present them here on a plane for you seems you're the light help yourself to some finger-licking food push the plank back when you finish thanks for watching and enjoy ",

        "content": "hi my name is BC Hoffmann hi I'm Judith Jones and this is recipe wars and today on recipe wars we are doing french toast live I will be doing Mario Batali's sons recipe Leo and Ben oh yeah in the video they actually make the French toast what Mario is showing him it's about cool dishes if these guys learn to make so let's talk about a couple of breakfast things Ben I was gonna start with some french toast tell us better what is what is about this recipe well french toast was one of the first recipes that we learned how to make and is it instantly became a breakfast classic no beautiful liova knows cinnamon swirl french toast which should be fun and i see you got a lot of ingredients there but mine are pretty simple I have 3 eggs 1 cup of milk maple syrup butter vanilla extract cinnamon nutmeg and cinnamon bread you know what yours is simple but this is - whoo this is this is the recipe of love right here or the morning-after whichever one happens to be so what's really cool I'm doing Gordon Ramsay's recipe pan perdu with cameras beaches basically posh eggy bread and the secret behind us of course is using old bread have used all Reds and absorb all the nice egg mixture and it gets nice and crispy on the outside peaches hot pan sugar it is a really nice recipe yes that's right it's it's cut and dry yours I think it's gonna be a little too cinnamon I do like cinnamon nose I love cinnamon but that's out that's cinnamon toast I'm doing all right let's do it let's go so I'm gonna start off I've got peaches I've got the frozen ones but I've got some fresh ones so I'm gonna I'm gonna take the fresh peaches I'm gonna have them now I'm gonna take the pit out and while he's doing that I'm just gonna get my eggs and milk mixture ready so in goes the milk and goes the eggs as well so I'm gonna take a little bit of frozen ones and a little bit of fresh ones just to have a nice blend of the two and it's really nice so we're just gonna make nice slices so for each half I'd say you get about roughly 6 slices out of the peach and I've just added in my eggs and now I'm gonna add in my cinnamon my nutmeg and my vanilla extract now note he doesn't actually put any sugar or sweetener in there only at the end he adds maple syrup so we'll whisk that up this is something super easy and again you can totally impress the person that you're with I like to make a french toast sandwich and then fry it together look at you you must get all the girls BC oh you know it you haven't got me yet let's just wait and see what you're ready yeah it's like all right all right I'm gonna add in another butter in my saute pan and let all pine get nice and hot so our mixture is ready so now it's time to do some dipping so I'm gonna get my cinnamon bread here and we're gonna do probably two out of time let them soak for a few seconds and into the hot pan they will go I mean want to get them nice and toasted brown on both sides probably a couple minutes on each side so my pan is nice and hot I've got 3/4 cups of sugar while that's going I'm also gonna take my eggs with the three eggs and throw in my heavy cream got a quarter cup of my heavy cream a quarter cup of my milk coming out throw both those in and I also have going my a confectioner sugar get that whisk so I've got my sugar it's starting to caramelize in the pan just mix that around a little bit so I just flip mine over as well got a nice golden brown color so that should be a couple minutes more so the sugar goes real quick when you're caramelizing it so we're just going through our peaches in get it nice and roast it in there now we're going to just throw our butter in after about three tablespoons of butter in there so I've got my basil real quick I'm going to just give that a quick shift and odd and we should also mention that usually day-old bread works better a little bit stay the staler the better basically when it comes to French bread stale bread it actually absorbs the egg batter better while still keeping it nice and crispy on the outside so I've got my basil I'm just gonna throw that in again perfume and then I am done with that we're gonna throw that turn my heat off throw that right back in the bowl that the peaches were in and then I have my vanilla this is gonna go in with my custard and you're going to go straight across the middle with the knife so you open it up right there and then all that beautiful sediment looking stuff let's steal some that's the vanilla oh you want some don't you you just have to wait till you get it in your french toast and there you have it right there on the tip of my blade I've got what looks like dirt that's actually vanilla so we'll throw that in give that a quick go-around so my coulis is gonna be quick easy we're just gonna take our raspberries and then I've got a little bit of lemon juice we're just gonna take two lemons cut them in half let's just take our strainer mesh strainer we're just gonna squeeze that in put it right over top yeah four of them four halves that equals 2 lemons ladies and gentlemen basic math for you and I'm done as always I'm always finished before you be seen why do you think that happens make sure you finish first well I'm gonna plate it up lovely golden brown and obviously you know if you want them more Brown toast them for longer if you want the less I like them a little bit more Brown that's how I like mine so for the finishing touches I am just gonna pour on this maple syrup as much or as little as you want my cinnamon french toast is done so we got my raspberries my lemon juice and I'm just gonna give that a quick 1/2 with the blender make sure it's on low to start you aren't gonna need long with this I'm just gonna crank it crank that bad boy I'm ready to take that and strain it you're just gonna take it right there pour it in with your spatula you got just running along the bottom sing a song about making coulis it's cool to make coulis you wait cool unless you make coulis I'm gonna head you out that's all getting edited I know and if it doesn't well awesome I've got my pan nice and hot ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna throw my butter and I've got my bread I'm just gonna give it a quick one two on each side I've got my pan nice and hot and I'm ready throw my bread in okay so this takes all of no time at all maybe a minute altogether 30 seconds on each side we're ready to pretty much plate this back way up and we're gonna take our peaches and we're gonna just put that right on top so you're just gonna finish with a little coolie on the plate and then the creme de la creme a little powdered sugar right on top and there you have it ladies and gentleman French toast okay I am gonna let feed you with my french toast okay and I'll feed you with my French and see which one you think is better just a little piece please oh you're getting a big one carbs you know I only have a big one to give to him we just go after Julius oh wait mmm-hmm that's really good tough decision yeah let's go for that I'm going in on this one yeah I'm gonna try my new job Wow the peach and the basil really make it on yours not raspberry coulis mmm tastes just like peaches ah that's ads tough call that is a tough call um I really do like the flavor of that cinnamon and maple syrup because you can never go wrong with that really that's traditional mine's like the bigger taste this one is gonna woo your woman mm-hmm did it do the dead this one's gonna help keep her yeah so so the question is did I need to do the Willing or do I need to keep you I think you would well alright I think that being said Gordon Ramsay is the winner is the winner yeah a spritz do it right and I'm Mario Batali Addison's or it comes in a close second yeah

        "content": "hi everyone I'm marina welcome to my kitchen and a new episode of the holidays are coming today since I had some eggnog in my fridge that needed to get used and because it's breakfast time I think we're gonna make some eggnog french toast perfect for this time of year because eggnog is available and because we're hungry for breakfast so let's see what I'm gonna do this is like so simple and for those of you who don't know how to make french toast this will be a good primer for you and for those of you who have been making french toast for a thousand years then you know there's a nice refresher have you ever done it egg nog style we had we buy our egg nog and a half gallons from the the mom-and-pop store where that we buy our milk from which we get in the glass bottles and this eggnog is positively fantastic it's deep yellow color it's very thick and it literally tastes like you're drinking Chavan illa pudding it's just really delicious and it is a once-a-year treat I even like it and Rick usually makes the eggnog face and it's because he doesn't like this strong back hint of nutmeg this particular year there's very very little nutmeg in it and he really likes it so we're gonna use the cup and a half that I have left in the bottle and what you see here is a cup and a half of eggnog plus a cup a half a cup of whole milk that I had in the fridge so that's what we're gonna start with and I'm gonna go ahead and just pop that right here in my pie plate for some reason I always make french toast in a pie dish and I'm just gonna go ahead and pop three eggs in here and I'm probably gonna have extra french toast mix and that's fine I can keep this in my fridge for a day or so tomorrow morning when the girls get up for breakfast if they want some french toast I can just slice an egg off and not put shell in there that would be great slice them thin I see slicing peg off slice them bread off and and fry them up some french toast but I wouldn't keep it for more than a couple of days before I got rid of it because it will start to turn 3/5 now we have homemade bread we often have homemade bread the best part about having a bread that's homemade is that you can slice this as thick as you like and when we make french toast it's kind of nice to have it on the thick side I'm gonna do this I'm gonna use my coffee foamer get this mixed up in there of course you don't have to do this by just thinking let's do that all right the only other thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add a little vanilla after I rinse this off and vanilla is absolutely optional you don't have to use it if you don't choose to not a problem but why not gild the lily a little right we have this great thick flavorful eggnog and it has a lot of good vanilla flavor in it but we're gonna skip boost it a little bit and that coffee foam or did a beautiful job I have to say it really mixed up that egg mixture very smoothly all right now we're gonna move over to the stove and we'll make some french toast all right I'm just gonna melt some butter in my very large iron skillet and I have this set over medium heat and I'm gonna just drop a piece of bread in this egg mixture and I'm gonna make sure it gets saturated and this is a hands-on task folks if you've never made french toast before you're gonna have to get your hands in some raw egg and milk and and it's all good it's not gonna kill you you can wash your hands that's the best part about being human God made us washable okay now give it a good shake and slop it on in there do the same to a second piece I'm gonna be able to do two pieces at a time when I'm making french toast for the entire family I get out my flat griddle and we do several pieces at once I'm gonna give this a good shake and plop it right in there next to it now french toast isn't ready util french toast is ready so you don't want to rush it what I am gonna do is I'm gonna back the heat off just a little bit and I'm gonna check the bottom here see I need to turn this because my heat is not even because the center of the skillet is warmer than the outer edges and then what I'm gonna do is because I don't have a lid for this pan is I'm gonna take a clean pizza pan I'm just gonna set it right on top this is going to help the center of the custard and the bread cook more quickly and evenly and then we're gonna be able to flip this in just a few minutes so in a couple of minutes like literally two minutes we're gonna come back I'm gonna show you what it looks like we're gonna flip it and then we're gonna finish cooking it off these are just bread crumbs from the bread don't have a copy that's that's right the alkaline okay we're ready to flip and you can see how it got a little puffy there and that's because it has two plates and we're gonna go ahead and flip these perfect now you don't have to cover them anymore you can just wait for them to cook off it's gonna take another couple of minutes and we'll be back and we'll fix you a plate of eggs milk french toast there you have it these cook for just another couple of minutes I made sure they were nice and even on both sides and now you're ready thinking eggnog french toast and the only other thing I'm gonna do because I'm gonna make it snow because it's eggnog french toast you make it a Christmas time right so make it snow with a little powdered sugar you serve this up with some jam some jelly some um maple syrup or whatever it is you like to have on french toast and you enjoy this this time of year it's perfect another great idea for Christmas breakfast or anytime you can get your hands on eggnog of course I hope that you try this and I hope that you love it and until next time happy holidays ",

        "content": "*hair warning* looks like a choucroute. hey guys, salut! it's Alex. today i'm showing you how to make proper French Toast 3 Ways. Classic, Super Clean and Super Guilty! French Toast is an iconic French recipe but unlike most of them, it's on the easy side! first off, the batter! in a bowl, mix 2 eggs and 4 tablespoons of sugar. a pinch of cinnamon, a drop of vanilla extract and a touch of salt. mix that nicely. i mean, really nicely. 1 cup of whole milk. and that simply is our batter done! i believe with all that liquid, you can make at least a dozen French Toasts. but now, to the most important part : THE BREAD. or as we call it in France : ze bread! so classically, french toast has to be made with stale bread and that's why in France, we are calling it \"pain perdu\", as known as \"lost bread\" but you know what? i don't even understand the concept of stale bread. it might be me being too much french,  definitely possible! but i find it rude to let the bread stale on the counter. and also very sad! that poor little boy! come see daddy! come see daddy! good boy! make half an inch or 1 centimetre thick slices out of sandwich bread. soak them in the batter, flip them and again soak them really nicely. they must be significantly heavier! in my opinion, if you make thin slices, you will only get undercooked or overcooked french toast, there is no way that you will get the crispy outside and the fluffy inside. no way! it's exactly like french fries. put a frying pan or a skillet on a medium-low heat. if you cook them on a high heat, it's gonna be faster, of course. but they will be burnt outside and still raw inside. faster? anyone? coat it with a neutral oil like canola oil or peanut oil using kitchen paper. place the slices in and make sure there is full surface contact. usually, you don't need more than 10 minutes to cook those slices. flip them over a few times just to check if everything's good. a minute before the end, sprinkle a tiny amount of sugar on both sides. *LE STUDIO UPDATE* today's update is quite small but very important to me! do you see that? it's supposed to support something! without further ado, *alex singing with joy* this is a reward sent from Youtube itself to celebrate a 100K subscribers on my channel! i don't have much to say but YES!! wee! and second, thank you! okay, back to the video! and that's how you make great french toast. i mean, easy, reliable and most importantly, delicious! there is a thin crispy caramelised outside, but inside it's moist, soft and it feels like a bit of a custard. of course you can use toppings like strawberries and almonds. but if it's done properly, i like mine simple. now to make a super clean and vegan version! replace eggs with 1 banana, and use almond or soy milk and maple syrup instead of caster sugar. last, coat the skillet with coconut oil. you want to be super careful because the toast tends to stick to the pan, even on very low heat! i don't know why they stick to the pan. maybe it's because of the banana, maybe it's because of something else, maybe you know the answer! so if you do, leave it in the comments below. at the end, banana and coconut bring really interesting flavours. inside it's really soft but to be honest, the crust is not as good as the previous one. so it's less indulgent, that's for sure. but at the same time, as it's clean and more lean, it's more likely to fit your everyday diet. unlike the super rich version! this is how you make it. use brioche bread instead of sandwich bread. then replace milk with cream. i know, it's really bad! and use a knob of butter instead of a coating of oil. the result is, of course, super indulgent! really creamy inside, super golden outside! taste wise, that super rich version is simply magnificent! but as expected, it's a bit higher in terms of calories so maybe just keep that version for when you really need it. your hangover, she break up, then you get up and you snap your toe into the corner of your bed! that's where you need it! i hope you like those recipes and if you did, give it a like! thumbs up and share that over your social media using the hashtag, #SPREADITLIKEBUTTER so that i can find your creation and showcase your lovely creations! so as you saw, i don't use toppings that much but maybe it's simply because i did not find the perfect topping for me yet! if you have ideas of great toppings, share them in the comments right below! last, people click subscribe cos i make new videos on sundays and it's most of the time about getting the posh out of french food! like that time when i made a  tarte tatin with sunny side up egg, braised bell peppers, really caramelised. and also a flavourful, juicy cherry tomatoes! but also i make some very weird stuff like that time where i showed 11, yes 11! different twisted uses of rice paper wrappers. many stuff to watch! catch you next time, guys! bye bye! salut!

I have given it to some friends and they've\nall liked it better than the French toast they usually make!\" There's nothing quite like well made French\nToast. Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside\n- when the craving for French Toast hits, this recipe will definitely satisfy! To start with, measure a quarter of a cup\nof all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl. Now slowly whisk in one cup of milk. Then, whisk in three eggs, a \npinch of salt, half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon, along with one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and one tablespoon of white sugar. Whisk this mixture together until it's smooth. Now, heat a lightly-oiled griddle or heavy\nfrying pan over medium heat. One at a time, soak twelve slices of thick\nbread in the batter until it's saturated. and cook each piece of bread, until it's golden\nbrown on both sides. The key is to have the heat high enough to\nbrown the outside of the bread, but low enough not to burn it. Serve the toast immediately, with your choice\nof topping. Butter, maple syrup and fruit are the traditional\nfavorites, but get creative with your favourites! You can also experiment with different breads,\nas well. Whole or sprouted grain breads, or a really\ngood sourdough loaf - all make fantastic versions of French Toast. Strawberries are sliced on top of a stack\nof Fluffy French toast that's already dripping with maple syrup and butter. ",

cream half a cup of dark brown sugar for bananas which will peel and slice six eggs and we're going to use a three of them whole and then three yolks who need a teaspoon of vanilla extract half a cup of whole milk and then of course the bread so this is a challah bread or chela bread whatever you want to call it uh you could use brioche or if you don't have any of that stuff you could use also just some thick Texas toast as well and that's pretty much it I mean you can also get some just some whipped cream the top when you're done afterwards but that's optional of course and other than that that's it so let's get to it alright so the first thing I'm going to do is prepare the caramel sauce it's going to go on top of the french toast so I'm going to start with I have my pan I use a skillet I'm just going to use this saucepan here this little pot I have it on medium heat and I'm going to add one stick of the butter that we had it from earlier and I'm gonna let that melt okay so now that the butter seems to be nice and melted I'm gonna stir it around a little bit more you can go ahead and add the brown sugar so I have a half a cup of that brown sugar now you want to make sure you pack it nice and tight into cups so it fills up all those spaces and you get as much as you need I'm just going to go ahead and drop this in here like that and i'm also going to add just two tablespoons of plain old water just to help smooth it out a bit okay and now i'm going to whisk that all around until the brown sugar melts nicely into the butter okay so see now that's all nice and incorporated and it's kind of syrupy a bit I'm going to take it off the heat and set it aside and I'm going to cover it and just let it a hang out for a bit while I go make the custard for the french toast alright so for the custard what I have here is the three whole eggs and then I've added the three yolks and to that I'm going to go ahead and incorporate the half a cup of whole milk and the quarter cup of heavy cream I could not spill it as well as the teaspoon of vanilla extract now this pinellas to make your french toast have a nice flavor all right teaspoon of vanilla extract and then I'm just going to whisk this all together and this is going to be the base for the custard which we're going to soak our french toast in before we fry it up in a pan okay so now back over to the stove what I've done is I've put a nice pan to cook our bread here i have the tablespoon of our remaining butter melting on medium heat and now that we have our custard all mixed together their eggs and our milk and vanilla we're just going to take our our nice kind of thickly sliced Holabird or brioche or texas toast whichever you had its time and let it soak I'm only gonna do a couple pieces of time because I don't really have a whole lot of room and I don't want to overcrowd my pan but you're gonna want to get this nice and soaked up in the egg mixture turn it over I know I'm digging my hands all in it but you know if you want to use a fork whatever I just like to use my hands okay once it's all nice and soaked up in our egg mixture we're going to take it and just bring it over to our pan with our melted butter it looks like i have room for like another one more so so i'll probably just soak one more piece of bread we're going to do this until we have all our bread soaked and nice and on the pan and we're just going to fry them up i want to fry them up for a few minutes on each side to a nice and brown and cooked through and then we'll continue on with the preparation of the caramel with the bananas alright so these have been cooking for a couple minutes already and i'm just going to go ahead and flip them over and see if they're good yeah see that's what you want to see nice golden brown not burnt not raw any not any kind of raw egg or anything still nice golden brown so i'm just going to flip them over and let them cook for a few more minutes on the other side so it gets nice and going around the other side as well alright so while the remainder of the bread is cooking and get that the last of that going I'm going to go ahead and take my four bananas I've peeled them and I'm just going to slice them into slices not too thin not too thick probably right about here just so when I put them back into the caramel sauce they'll hold up and not just break down into mush but a continuous slice all these up just like that then I'm going to add them back into the this sauce we made earlier on a medium heat just to get them all nice and coated and we'll use that as a topping for our french toast all right so now we have a bread all cooked up nicely I took a sauce that we made earlier and put it back on the heat just on a low low to medium heat and what I'm going to do is I'm going to add our bananas that we sliced up back into here and let them cook until they're nice and tender and then we're just going to use that the top our french toast and then it would be done and I'll show you what it looks like when we're ready to eat okay just added the bananas and I'm just going to stir them around a bit get an oh nice incorporated in the caramel sauce that we made vacuum eyes some recipes you can add rum or rum extract and I haven't added any of that today I'm just skipped on that but it's still gonna taste just as good all right well there you have it guys there's the finished product i've got the toast all toast it up I had the bananas got all nice and corporated into the caramel sauce made and all I did was the stack of the toast I'd topped it with the banana sauce mixture add a little whipped cream that's optional obviously you can also add some powdered sugar or whatever you like but it should be great let's go ahead and try it out just gonna chop off little piece here see mmm that's good mmm sauce is buttery it's got the banana flavor to it toast is nice and tender it's great anyway guys so I hope you enjoyed this like and subscribe and comment down below if you try it out and let me know what you think I hope you do it's a good recipe i like it doesn't take that long and it's a lot cheaper than going out to ihop or something like that anyway uh so yeah guys until next time see you later ",

        "content": "hi I'm Lisa McRee with the skinny for everyday health if you've ever ordered french toast at a restaurant on a Sunday morning you might want to think again those fabulous French toast platters can have a thousand to twelve hundred calories moolah lard fr\u00e8re Jacques a'right ding-dang-dong but that doesn't mean you have to say au revoir to french toast forever now you can make french toast at home this Sunday it's super simple and super quick and has fewer than 200 calories of play so you can have an encore next Sunday without having to loosen your penta loans alright now regular french toast is made with full calorie bread obviously heavy cream and whole eggs tons of sugar and the real maple syrup but we're going to drastically cut calories by using a few skinny substitutions light bread has only 45 calories of sliced and instead of whole eggs we're going to use a half a cup of liquid egg whites I really like the ones better and the carton they're so easy to use and just a splash of fat-free half-and-half it has just about 10 calories turn my pan on now let's season the egg and cream mixture we're gonna use a little bit of brown sugar you don't want to use too much you're not actually using the brown sugar to sweeten the bread and we'll get to that later with the syrup but you want it to help the bread Brown and then we're gonna use some cinnamon a whole teaspoon in fact I know it seems like a lot of seasoning for just two pieces of bread but because you're taking away all that fat you want to add in a lot of flavor and cinnamons a great way to do it we're gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla because I I think it just has to be there and a pinch of salt not too much but it just helps bring out the natural sweetness of all the other ingredients and instead of full fat butter which would add a couple of hundred calories we're going to use fat-free butter cooking oil it's just flavored with butter not made with butter I'm gonna let that heat up for about 20 seconds while we whisk our ingredients and soak our bread now you want the bread to be really well coated but you don't want it to stay in it too long because it will fall apart on you and see how that cinnamon is going right into the bread it's really going to add some great flavor all right how's my pan doing I can feel the heat I don't want to drop the toast on before it's hot so I'm gonna give it a little test run oh look a little sizzle just ready to go carefully load those slices you don't want them to tear alright and we're going to let those cook for a few minutes to get nice and brown and crunchy on one side while we chop up some toppings we're lucky in California to have strawberries almost year-round if you don't have strawberries where you live just use frozen ones they'll be fine now my kids love strawberries so I always try to have them in the refrigerator as a snack and when I can add them to meals like on top of this dish it's great extra vitamins extra fiber all right check on this french toast and see how it's doing Oh perfect ah yay carefully flip these guys over oh and then what you're gonna do is immediately turn your heat down because you want the french toast to keep cooking so that that egg is cooked all the way through but you don't want the edges to burn you know my kids love bananas too but I'm a little careful with them a whole banana has 100 calories so if you're gonna add it to the French toast just to keep your calorie count in check just use like a quarter seems about right tick these again oh great now I want to show you how they're browning on both sides and the egg mixture weeping out a little bit as it cooks you may have to flip them a few times to get them thoroughly cooked through and keep doing it until they're done you don't want to eat raw egg you'll know when they're finished because they'll be firm in the center but not burned see just continue to flip until they get to that nice color that you're looking for you know I make these just on any given school day now because they're just so easy and they make everybody so happy pretty all right we're gonna put our toppings on strawberries oh gosh this smells so good my whole kitchen smells like better even I didn't use any and the sweetness and the cinnamon flavor perfect alright and just a couple of other things to make this really beautiful breakfast blueberries love them they had them fresh at the market this morning and I thought they'd be the perfect little addition isn't that gorgeous with the red white and blue awful patriotic for a breakfast alright now here's the real skinny secret about this breakfast sugar free maple syrup I know I'm using the person saying don't use anything artificial however this is a cheap that's really worth it real maple syrup has 200 calories in a quarter cup this stuff has 20 I know you do the math Oh perfect and if you want to really show off if your kids are having a sleepover how about dust a little bit a powdered sugar by the way I'm just using a tea strainer good little tip right you just want enough to dress it up but not so much that you jack up your blood sugar and that's it next time you feel like french toast instead of spending $10 or $12 and a thousand to twelve hundred calories on a restaurant version try this skinny version of french toast at home your scale will say merci beaucoup check out all of my skinny videos on this channel and post a comment let me know what you think you ",

Maybe good now but I think should mixed  a little thick and smooth I will add what I mixed stuff into the tray which has spaces for white bread Soak the bread actually It's more yellow than this video in this video looks white okay like this soak the bread heating a pan put the olive oil first so it won't burn I wonder if is better to baked a little more? add the butter so it smell good like savory I think this is good cooking I put the butter on both sides well its done\n2 nd of bread it just failed okay not failed but it cut I think maybe It was soaked a bit ? the right side is really good I  will try to eat first I will cut of pieces Oh ~ wow fluffy ! tastes good ! I made fluffy French toast ! If you think  less sweet, then may be better to put more sugar and maybe not Oligosaccharides if you care maybe better to use coconut sugar or something like that stuff so yeah !\nit was easy to make fluffy French toast recipe ! now I will make pudding with a mix bowl liquid filter out  with  sieve or strainer Like this Added into heat-resistant container\nAnd then heat it up in the microwave roughly in a microwave at 500w for 1~2 minutes. the mixture is well risen leave until the mixture  is cooked when the mixture is not hot then put in the refrigerator now cook  the caramel sauce Sugar 2 tablespoons, water 1 tablespoon this time won't mixed up Wait until boiling Sugar 2 tablespoons,   water 1 tablespoon Do not  touch until boiled patient is important when it's start boiling mix with pot put too much ? funny shaped on the top but look delicious \nsounds like sweet okay it had passed an hour maybe added a lot of caramel sauce so shaking pudding ! but looked yummy It is  yellow colored  than this video I think it should have heated much better . so it will be sweet all of this pudding thank you for watching! see you next time!

        "content": "not dude settle for a boring breakfast this weekend when you can have french toast and it's stuffed with bacon in it oh my gosh you love french toast John this is like famously phenomenal and making I don't mean to toot my own horn but I just did I to tune yeah here with his favorite french toast recipes we want to welcome a guy who apparently just rolled out of bed cooking for dads host and blogger Rob Barrett gotta thank goodness for the robe well you know it's a good thing it's you know this is the kind of thing you just want to wake up and you roll out of bed go downstairs and make on a Saturday and have it be really easy that's kind of the recipe that I like to do yeah it's something and simplify it but I hate french toast I don't like it you guys are gonna have a fight well so what I tried to do is find the way it's a way that i can make french toast that isn't all soggy because i'm a texture guy the soggy bread thing i get on board so oh I scoured the web and private maybe I should take over from here cuz I know how to make it not soggy uh-huh so here's what you do yeah rob is here right I just say what's going great so anyways here's some tips what you actually have to do is be really deliberate you actually have to get serious about it oh man so here we go be very afraid okay first of all start with good bread yeah you can use slice like the Thomas English muffin bread if you want but this is a cual skis the French slope it's like a French bread but it's in a loaf so it's really good so we're gonna cut off the heel here and we're gonna cut a half-inch piece you can measure if you want okay so you want to be pretty slut precise with these I think this is a nice way to use this up too because sometimes I have the problem were if i buy a loaf like that I don't use it out fast enough right on the weekend you just whip up a bunch of French toaster there you go exactly and then for stuff you almost have to do have to do an inch like this then okay we're gonna do for the stuff is take this knife like this uh-huh what's gonna cut a slit okay right in the middle and that's where all the good stuffing is it goes right now but American a Test Kitchen found out is that you if you dry your bread on an oven rack is 350 for 10 minutes flipping ones uh-huh it really comes out nice and not soggy yeah oh it's gonna be crispy er right so that's what we've done we put on our bread in the oven for 350 but that's five minutes you're flipping this what I'm saying you gotta take some steps and kind of do it right no I just I just cook it for about an hour and a half well then it wouldn't be Chris all right hey tip number two instead of milk we're gonna use half-and-half so they don't take it like to pour that in this bowl I like where you're going with that right it doesn't sleep in quite as fast and so it doesn't get spread soggy yeah then we're gonna use just egg yolks no egg whites all right hey egg yolk so it's the whites to kind of give it the via eggy smell and taste and so this way you get all the nice custody part without that smell okay it once blew full of vanilla okay and put a pinch of salt candy hands make light work and then three spoonfuls of the brown sugar 1 4 l's brown sugar right this is like the basic batter because I know you've got a few varieties all right this is your basic batter and this is how to make french toast that I asked you like okay now the next thing you'll do it ago just put it in a nine by nine pan and I by 13 pan pour that in there once that's all stirred up no it's all good and sturdy I know you've got some varieties got like apples and oranges balls because we're just gonna make the the one with the hopes that all stirred up okay we're just gonna make the one with the well so here so here's the basic basic 20 seconds wait really 20 seconds only right if we decide only that's our existing this song dooda dooda camptown races if you do too but that's one place out flip it over 20 seconds again yeah okay and then you're gonna put that in over medium heat for 23 minutes with a little butter that is the basis for that that's your basic basic french toast comes out looking like this but we want to stuff it up yes yes all right so first we're gonna do the eggs bacon so we've dried this out same as before this hasn't been in the oven that's right layouts right you just just pull it open and I put any other eggs and bacon yeah I've been a sausage and eggs before and it's really good but you know I think the bacon probably go even better cuz you got maple bacon right yeah right yeah all right do that one same thing 20 seconds this we're gonna do the apples oh those annoying just there's only two things in the world right yeah apples and oranges everything will be contained in this Tulsa so here's apples with a little orange juice squeeze it like this one penis put that in only have to cook them each side then 23 minutes now just give it a little bit of zest here you do that call to disaster all right yeah little zest just a tad for the taste little sugar then that gets stuffed into these nice that's actually you want to precise it thin these are honey crisp they're in they cost about seven dollars an apple but they're good still okay all right you're gonna try baby yeah we gotta try this right is it this is so we have the French toast recipes we got all these recipes along with others from rob to on our eight page of our website Twin Cities live.com oh my gosh it is Chris means like a little chewier so say does that Brad right right but it's not foggy not soggy it's a nice touch tree thing and here you have your you're sweet you're salty your protein your starch it's right nirvana breakfast thank you so much Rob job

        "content": "- Hi everyone. Today I'm gonna share with you my ultimate breakfast sandwich. This thing has a little bit of everything. It's got hash browns, eggs, bacon, cheese, all of that sandwiched between two slices of French toast. I'm gonna get started with the custard. We have six eggs here, keep in mind, that the recipe is for four servings, we're making one today. While you're beating this, you want to make sure that the yokes\nand the egg whites are well incorporated, otherwise it comes out uneven while you're cooking it. You could skip this portion and just make your ultimate egg sandwich with just two slices of bread, but that really doesn't constitute it\nbeing ultimate, right? Pour the eggs into the pan. I'm using a shallow dish,\nso it's a little bit easier to soak our bread. We'll add our cream and milk. A little bit of sugar. Our cinnamon. And, lastly, the vanilla. And take this and mix it all up. So that the cinnamon is all mixed in. It has a tendency to settle\nwhen it just sits there. Let's grab our bread and get going. For the bread you definitely want to have something that's going to retain its structure when\nyou soak it in the custard, so go for something that is hardy, it's crusty, not something soft. And the reason I'm telling you that is I made this for the first time, and, well of course I used like,\nthe softest white bread, right? I put it into the\ncustard, I pulled it out, and half of the bread was in the custard, and the other half was in my hand. So you definitely want to use something that will hold its shape. Press it down. Let it just sit there for a bit. And we'll flip it. Okay, we'll let these soak\nfor about a minute or two, you just want to make sure the custard seeps into the bread. Okay, let's get started\non the hash browns. We'll carefully add one in. We'll let that cook, and\nwe'll have the bacon cook. We're gonna let this go for\nabout three to five minutes. It looks like our bacon\nand hash browns are ready, so let's just transfer\nthat over to our board. Now we're gonna cook the French toast in the pan that the bacon cooked in. It has all that nice\nflavor in there already, so I don't want to waste it. We're gonna have that cook on medium until the underside gets nice and golden. Our French toast is ready, it's nice and golden brown, as it should be. So we'll move them out of the pan. Make room to cook our egg. And I'm using the same pan. This won't take too long,\nwhat we're looking for is something that's across between almost a soft-boiled egg, and\nstill runny at the center. And you can check your egg\njust by tapping the yolk, and that is still a little\nbit too runny for me, so I'm gonna let it cook\njust a tad bit longer. No breakfast sandwich is complete without some melted cheese on top. Okay everyone, we're almost done. We're going to go ahead\nand layer our sandwich. Get your hash brown, put it down. We'll put the egg on top. There's some bacon on there. If you're like me, you\nlike a lot of bacon. Doesn't that look good? You can see the egg,\nit's already beginning to drip out of there. Last part, we are going to dust\nsome powdered sugar on top. This just makes it extra\ndecadent, I love it. If you're my husband, you\nwill pour syrup all over this. That's just a little too crazy for me. Let's cut into this. And there we go. The yolk is almost like a soft-boiled, the way I exactly like it. Okay, now here's the fun part. You guys get to watch me bite into this giant-sized sandwich, and let's see if I can do it without getting food all down my shirt. I'm just gonna enjoy this. Okay, so it looks like\nthere's a lot going on in there, because there is, but you can see it's\nnot too terribly messy. I don't have too much food on me. Oh, there is a little spot there. But I always have food\non my when I'm cooking, so never mind that. I hope you enjoyed this recipe, and don't forget to subscribe and leave a comment and tell\nme what you think of it. I'll see you next time, bye. ",

        "original_title": "Make French Toast",
        "content": "hi everyone i am making another classic breakfast favorite today and it is the french toast Eulalie its rich delicious and simple to make so with no further ado let's get started everything that you see here was purchased from the 99 cents only store except for the ground cinnamon and the apple cider vinegar and let me show you what I've got I have here a loaf of Texas toast bread I like using this kind of bread when making french toast because it's nice and thick here's two slices here which I had already lightly toasted in my bread toaster it is recommended that you use either slightly stale or day-old bread but since I'm using fresh bread I took two slices out and I placed it into my bread toaster and just lightly toasted it set it on the lowest setting possible and just lightly toast your bread so that you can dry it out if you don't do that and you just use fresh bread and just dunk it into the custard later it'll just all fall apart so once you have lightly toasted it let it sit on the counter for at least 10 minutes until it has completely cold and I have some brown sugar here or if you want you can use regular sugar your choice I also have some salt three eggs some butter vanilla extract a maple syrup and some honey and these are to top my french toast later I also purchased a bunch of bananas for only ninety cents okay they're not very pretty but they can be super sweet inside and we'll need some milk as well I forgot to mention that if you can be using slightly stale or day-old bread then you don't need to toast your bread you can go ahead and skip that part x i'm going to make some homemade buttermilk and i have 1 cup of milk hair i'm going to add 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar we're just from this here and then we'll go ahead and give this a stir now if you don't want to use buttermilk in your french toast you can always use just rather milk or half and half we'll go ahead and let this sit for five minutes and welcome back to that I just cracked three eggs into a bowl and now I'm going to whisk them be sure to whisk them really well so I'll spend about a minute or two doing this the buttermilk has been sitting here for five minutes so let's go ahead and pour it in with the egg and whisk to combine the two we need 3 tablespoons of sugar and i am using 3 tablespoons of brown sugar today but like i said earlier you can use white sugar instead of you want or you can even combine the two whatever you want to do will work just fine so let me go ahead and add the brown sugar and we're going to let's get and of course if you don't like your french toast to be a sweet then go ahead and feel free to use less sugar that's fine too let's add a pinch of salt and just put it into the bowl add in a tablespoon of vanilla extract and add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon it smells so good soon as I smelled the cinnamon it reminded me of cinnamon buns now whisk everything until it's well combined I'm now going to transfer the egg mixture to a baking dish butter the griddle but if you don't have a stovetop griddle then you can just use a Ritter skillet that's fine too go ahead and butter the grill all right that should be good enough so let's go ahead turn the heat to medium and how you know when the pan is ready is when you start to see the bubbles form and it will subside while waiting for the pan to heat up I'm going to dunk my two slices of bread into the custard or egg mixture and just hold it down for like about 15 seconds okay let's go ahead and flip it on over and we'll hold the other side for about 10 seconds and you don't want to over saturate the bread because it will start to fall apart and let the excess egg mixture drip off the bread and place it onto the pan do the same thing with this one just hold it up and let the excess drip off immediately place it into the pan okay and as soon as you have placed the slices of bread onto the hands Amy of each turn your heat down to medium-low will cook both sides so for about six to seven minutes depending on your pan is going to vary and griddle heats and evilly so I kind of got to move my toast around after like every minute or two and you may have to do this evening if you have a pan that heats uneasily as well go ahead and move your toast around so get brown evenly then about six or seven minutes I believe they are ready to be flipped now let's go ahead and flip them over there we go that's gorgeous here's the other one they are perfect okay so that's what I did so every minute or two I just kind of rotated the bread around so that it can brown evenly so I'll just cook the french toast for about six to seven minutes on each side and once they are golden brown like this and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside it shouldn't be soggy at all it should be thoroughly cooked so six or seven minutes later we'll go ahead and plate these but remember to rotate them every minute or two so you get a nice even browning so while I'm waiting for my french toast to cook over here I went ahead and cut up one banana and that's why I'm on top my french toast with today alrighty these are done so i'll let me go ahead and turn off the heat and let's plate these babies put it on a plate right over here let's get everyone here are the french toast all done now you can top it with whatever you want maybe with a pat of butter and some maple syrup which is classic or maybe you like honey instead but today i'm going to top it with some powdered sugar bananas and maple syrup okay I just sprinkled some powdered sugar onto my french toast and right here and you can get this at the 99 cents only store as well now let's play some bananas on here mmm it smells delicious the smell of cinnamon the smell bananas I mean just like combination Ollie smelled it is absolutely divine okay it's time to pour some maple syrup drizzle for me so you can see that right there oh wow mm-hmm there we go you guys think about

        "content": "Hi everyone and welcome back to my channel. Today I\u2019m sharing with you a twist on classic\nFrench Toast, this is stuffed french toast. It\u2019s a custardy bread filed with cream cheese\nand strawberries, topped with sweet maple syrup. There are endless possibilities when making\nthis, you can stuff it with whatever you want, or whatever you have on hand. It\u2019s breakfast done right. So if you would like to learn how to make\nthis, then let\u2019s get started. The first thing we\u2019re doing is slicing some\nbread. I\u2019m using just a white loaf, but if you\nwanted something a little bit more interesting brioche is the way to go. It\u2019s a very enriched bread so it\u2019s perfect\nfor french toast. Try to use bread that is a few days old which\nhas gone a little dry and stale. It will soak up the milk and egg mixture much\nbetter than fresh bread, and you\u2019re usually left with delicious custardy french toast,\nrather than soggy pieces that just fall apart. Cut the slices from the middle of the loaf\nso they will be around the same size. They need to be about an inch thick or 2-3\ncm. You don\u2019t want the slices to be too thick\nthat the bread won\u2019t cook the whole way through, but not thin either that it can\u2019t\nsoak up much of the egg mixture. Lay the slices of bread out on the chopping\nboard while we prepare the filling for french toast. If you would like the recipe for this Stuffed\nFrench Toast it will be in the information box below this video, and also on my website,\njust click the link on the screen. For the French Toast filling, place some room\ntemperature cream cheese into small bowl. Make sure it\u2019s at room temperature as it\nwill mix a lot more easily and also spread a lot more evenly onto the bread. To sweeten up the cream cheese add a few tablespoons\nof icing sugar or powdered sugar to the bowl. I\u2019m using a wooden spoon to combine the\ningredients together, but a whisk will also work. Mix it together until everything is evenly\ncombined. This should only take a few minutes, the cream\ncheese will start to look very lumpy but it should start to smooth out nicely. Divide the cream cheese mixture between the\nfour slices of bread. Use a knife to spread the cream cheese mixture\nevenly across each slice of bread. We want quite a thick even layer, so make\nsure it has good coverage. For every person you are making the stuffed\nfrench toast for you need two slices of bread as they will be sandwiched together. This recipe will serve 2 people but it can\nbe easily doubled to serve more. A quick fact about french toast, it\u2019s not\nactually french, it wasn\u2019t created in France, nor was the person who created it french. The name just comes from a chef named Joseph\nFrench. It was created as a way to revive stale old\nbread that otherwise would have been wasted, and today it\u2019s turned into a popular breakfast\nfood. Along with the cream cheese I\u2019m stuffing\nthe french toast with strawberries. If these aren\u2019t in season where you live,\nyou can use any type of frozen berries, just defrost them before you use them and they\nwill work perfectly. I\u2019m slicing the strawberries into quite\nthin slices, you don\u2019t want thick slices, as this will be quite bulky and therefore\nstop the two slices of bread sticking together easily. Place the thinly sliced strawberries into\na single layer onto two of the slices of the bread. They can overlap a small amount like I\u2019m\ndoing here, just don\u2019t make more than one layer. The remaining two slices of bread won\u2019t\nneed any strawberries as they will be placed on top, creating a sandwich. Make sure to leave a small gap around the\nedge of the bread so it is just the cream cheese mixture . When the French Toast is\ncooked the cream cheese will melt and create a glue that will hold the two slices of bread\ntogether. Pick up the slices of bread without the strawberries\nand place it on top to create the sandwiches. Press down on the bread to make sure it has\nstuck together and the strawberries aren\u2019t going to just fall out. Set the bread to the side. In a clean bowl we\u2019re making the French\nToast mixture to dip the bread into. Crack in two good quality free range eggs. Measure out a cup of milk and pour into the\nbowl with eggs. Here is a good time to add any type of flavouring\nyou would like to the French Toast, one of my favourite things to add is a sprinkle of\ncinnamon. Or you can just leave it plane like I did\nhere. Use a fork to beat the ingredients together\nuntil they are well combined. This bowl is a little too small to dip the\nbread into so I\u2019m pouring the egg mixture into a shallow dish that is large enough to\nfit the bread. It\u2019s easier to pour it into a dish as the\nbread can sit flat and soak up the mixture. Place in one of the sandwiches and leave for\na minute or so to soak up some of the liquid. While waiting for the bread place a medium\nsized fry pan over medium heat and add a small amount of butter to the pan to melt. Turn the bread over carefully, not letting\nthe slices of bread fall apart and leave for a further minute to soak up on the opposite\nside. Remove the bread from the dish and place it\ninto the hot fry pan. Cook the french toast for about 4 minutes,\nchecking the bottom occasionally that it\u2019s not burning. It will be ready to to flip when the bottom\nhas crisped up and is golden brown. To flip the french toast use a spatula. Since there was a gap left around the edge\nfrom the strawberries the French Toast should be properly stuck together. Cook for a further 4 minutes or until nicely\ngolden brown. Remove the French Toast from the fry pan and\nplace on a chopping board to slice. Repeat with the remaining French Toast. Cut the toast in half and place onto a plate. Sprinkle with icing sugar or powdered sugar,\ndrizzle with maple syrup and enjoy. This is a fun and interesting way to make\nClassic french toast a little more interesting. There are endless possibilities of what you\ncould stuff the toast with. Banana and Chocolate is an amazing mix.

        "content": "look at this beautiful bread this is challah bread and it makes a really excellent french toast and see its kind of shiny it actually has more eggs in it than a regular bread would and I'm going to show you how to make this french toast let's get started now it's best to use bread that the couple days old that's starting to dry out and I bought this bread fresh and so what I'm going to do is slice it in three-quarter inch slices and I'm actually going to bake it for 10 minutes just to dry it out which when it's drier it will absorb the egg mixture better so I'm just going to make sure that it does that okay this holla actually has some raisins in it golden raisins and regular raisins that's just fine so I'm going to show you how I do that but if you want you can skip that step or just let your challah bread dry out on its own I'm putting the slice bread on a dry cookie sheet baking sheet and I've preheated the oven to 350 degrees and i'm going to bake it for 10 minutes and halfway through at the five-minute mark i'm going to turn the bread over into a large bowl i'm going to put three eggs and this is a small version of this recipe by the way you can double this so three eggs three quarters of a cup of milk I'm using almond milk a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract and then in this dish I have a half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon a pinch of nutmeg and a quarter teaspoon of salt and I'm going to wish it really well but if you want you can put this into your blender and blend it into tears for you if you don't have a whip pretty good and now I'm going to put it into a shallow dish where the bread will be dipped next in some kind of a shallow dish pour some of the egg mixture you don't need to put it all and then we're going to put in a few pieces of the challah bread and let them soak for about a minute or two on each side and meanwhile over here I'm going to heat up over medium heat without a tablespoon one maybe about a tablespoon of butter you can always add more so put it on medium heat and let that melt and I won't keep this on for the whole minute that I will be flipping the bread after a minute or two you can flip the bread over if you did the oven method to dry it out you don't have to do it while it's warm you can let it cool down a little bit so you could do this ahead of time and i'll do another minute or two on this side while the butter is melting alright the butter is melted and now i'm going to hit the spread over i actually got involved with something else and they're probably soaked for a little longer than it should so now they're going to cook in a pan for two to three minutes per side so after two minutes shotgun to see if they're cooked yeah and if they're not then go ahead and add a little more time when it's gone on the first side look it over this is a lot of butter by the way now that I look at it I probably would use less butter and then cook it for another two or three minutes before I go on just a quick piece of advice if you're making this holla french toast for a crowd and you're just cooking a few at a time you want to keep them warm you can put them on a platter of some type that's oven safe and put it in a warm oven not a hot oven and that will keep the french toast warm while you're cooking the rough when it's done serve it up on a plate I like this just with regular maple syrup not the fake stuff the real stuff but you can use fruit you can use strawberries you can sprinkle it with some powdered sugar whatever you want so that's how you make challah bread french toast ",

        "content": "Hello everyone welcome to my virgin kitchen\nI am in my in laws house which is very strange indeed thats all im going to say its abit\nweird and theres a lovely picture of our wedding a little montage to the side of me. Your not\non your own though I am here. Yeah Mrs Barry is here I havent broken in yeah we are just\ndoing our voice overs cos the house is quite noisy. Today this is a red velvet French toast\nabsolutely gorgeous its got a lovely vanilla bean cream cheese filling and its red so thats\nromantic isnt it. Erh we are doing some valentines recipes we just did the hidden heart cupcakes\nthe other day and heres another one for you to be inspired by and complete your valentines\nday. If you want to know how to do it all the recipe ingredients method all that bits\nand bobs are on myvirginkitchen.com and this is how we did it. Of course you could make\nthis French toast which Mrs Barry refers to as eggy bread which is quite the British term\nfor it right you could make this without the gorgeous cream cheese filing which turns that\nflavour up to 11 you are gonna love it. In a mixing bowl with some cream cheese in there\njust simply add in some sugar and a little bit of vanilla extract just give it a tini\nbit of vanilla spank there and it really does taste it right at the end. Give it a good\nold beat together make sure that sugar is fully dissolved in there and for the time\nbeing just sit it in the fridge it will just firm it up. Next we are going to make our\nrandomly very red ergh coating for the bread so in to a bowl combine together two eggs\nso crack them in there I did crack a little bit of shell in there I should definitely\nuse some of my gadgets one of these days. Then pour in your buttermilk add a little\nbit of sugar then drop in some more vanilla proper vanilla vibe going through this recipe\nand then some cocoa powder. Now beat that together its going to be a bit powdery at\nfirst we really want to whisk it up as well as you can just to make sure all of that cocoa\npowder is dissolved through you dont want it being all clumpy alright its really really\nimportant. And I know what your thinking you are looking at that thinking thats quite brown\nhow are we going to make that rouge my friends. We are going to add some food colouring you\nare going to need quite a bit but it is up to you could do the shade of red 50 shades\nof red no uh that you want to do ok so add as much food colouring I used actually a whole\nlittle tiny gel tube to get the right vibrant colour in there and with that done its ready\nfor cooking. So first I wanted to try it in a frying pan where you dunk your bread in\nand I didnt lubricate the pan I got it warm I thought oh we are just going to flash fry\nthis and see if it works dont do that ok because it leaves a bit of a bready residue in your\npan. So what you do want to do is get your frying pan and a little bit of spray oil or\nbutter if your feeling a little bit cheeky. Just melt that in there then shove in your\ndumped bread and maybe about two and half minutes on medium heat is all it needs just\nto initially char it and flip it over repeat both sides. Now its completely optional if\nyou do completely char it up um you can just cover it with icing sugar anyways you know\nmost eggy bread is quite charred anyway. But as you see when I rested it down it did make\nquite a difference in deed. So all that\ufffds left to do now s grab our chilled cream cheese\nfilling from the fridge and wedge it between two slices of bread you can just have it like\nthat as it is it will be gorgeous but no we finish it off with some chocolate sauce another\ndollop of cream cheese on top and of course the token sprinkling of icing sugar all over.\nAnd then we are sliced into triangles it looks absolutely gorgeous to as it was like a valentines\nday treat I did give Mrs Barry the treat of eating it and I think you enjoyed it right\nI did it was delicious hopefully the face on the camera right now shows that I did have\na nibble too. Absolutely gorgeous I tell you I mean you can really taste the cocoa powder\nthe smell when you cook it and there is that vanilla vibe going through it um maybe serve\nit with some fruit if you want to zing it up a tini bit more but trust me it\ufffds a nice\nlittle valentines day treat. So that\ufffds it folks nice easy recipe dont forget to check\nout Mrs Barrys hidden cupcake recipe with hearts in there and theres loads more valentines\nday inspiration over on myvirginkitchen.com so dont forget to subscribe for regularly\nvideos follow us on social media for behind the scenes bits and bobs and we will see you\nagain next time.

        "content": "hey youtube let's make some french toast the ingredients for french toast are: a couple of eggs, some leftover bread, a cup of milk, well, half a cup of milk and when I say cup I mean a coffee cup is fine, cinnamon, butter, if you're doing the deluxe version, throw a teaspoon of vanilla extract, if you got it great use it if you don't have it, don't worry about it ... first step is to beat the eggs and milk together. milk.  If you've got a pretty whisk, use a pretty whisk. If you don't have a pretty whisk, use a fork.  When no one's looking, sprinkle in a little bit of salt!  Yeah, it's a sweet dish but salt helps your tongue taste.  It opens up your tongue for receiving flavors so if you have a little bit of salt in your dishes it makes them tasty!  You shouldn't taste salt, you should taste flavors! Optional vanilla extract. Non-optional cinnamon A spoonful!  Half a spoonful? Once you've got your cinnamony delicious custard mixed together, pour it in a flat bowl.  If I'm cooking eggs, I'm using my Teflon pan. The secret to using teflon: heat it up first.  Get it good and hot and then add your butter. I like to put my custard in a in a pie pan just because the bread is flat and it makes it easier to soak the bread in the custard. If you're dealing with a flat bowl instead of the mixing bowl that you had a minute ago, it will go better. All right! Right into the frying pan. These are like sponges. Squeeze it a little. A gentle touch and you can get the bread to soak up the custard. OK, right into the pan. And fry your french toast. Look at what's happening. Look at these giant bubbles all along the edges here. There's a lot of moisture in the egg and in the milk. It's going to create these giant bubbles. Watch these bubbles as the french toast cooks the bubbles will diminish and that's how we know it's time to flip!  Still have pretty big bubbles. Have a look. Still pretty flabby.  No browning yet. Teflon got a nice slide! A little brown under there! I'm gonna turn the heat down but with the bubbles... These are still big... Here! Tiny bubbles! Time to flip! Nice tiny bubbles! Here's the secret pro-tip: sprinkle with sugar as they're almost done and flip.  You'll get a nice brown with that sugar.  It will give you a little bit of a caramelly crust.  Go in with the granulated sugar again. We're mere seconds from done here. Nice. Nice. Just want to caramelize that sugar I sprinkled on. At this point, we're just caramelizing the sugar on the outside and we're trying to make sure we get the inside to cook just enough. The moisture in the egg and the milk will steam and puff theese just the slightest bit. If you watch closely, you'll see they're getting a little bit thicker. Imperative not to burn at this point! We've come a long way! We're doing great so far. I've got a nice thickness. You can see the difference between the thickness of the french toast and the thickness of the edge of the slice. Here get a nice little puff. Double-check that. Nice brown there!  You've got a nice puff on this one. Don't want to get too dark. Let's get that out.  The pan is smoking hot. Don't burn it. Getting a little brown but we're not burnt yet... I taking it!  All that's left now is a little maple syrup and you're ready to go.

        "content": "Stephanie Manley: Hi! This is Stephanie Manley and you know me from\nCopykat.com. But today I'm working my way through my old\nHome Economics book from junior high school to where I can teach you how to cook just\nhow I was taught how to cook. And today we're making French Toast, and it's\nvery very easy to make. And everyone, or practically everyone has\nsome left over bread and an egg and some milk. And guess what! That's all you need to make a nice breakfast,\nor lunch, doesn't matter. Okay, so I'm using a griddle here. Now, if you don't have one you can use a skillet,\nthat's going to work just as well. But I'm using my griddle, because I love being\nable to make so many pieces at once. This is really really easy to do, you need\na few ingredients, not too many. You need bread, we're going to use a quarter\ncup of milk. Now, ideally you should try to measure liquid\ningredients in a liquid measuring cup because they're more accurate this way. If you don't have one, that's okay, but if\nyou do, grab that one. We're going to use one egg. Now, I'm using a large egg, if you only have\nsmall eggs, you might want to use a couple, but just one egg. We need just a little bit of salt because\nthat helps everything taste a little bit better. We're going to use sugar because this recipe\nwas developed a long time ago when we used to stick sugar in everything. No, actually sugar is pretty good in here. And, just a sprinkle of cinnamon if you like,\nthat's going to add some great flavor. So, let me tell you what we're going to do. We're simply going to take our egg, we're\ngoing to crack it in our bowl and we're just going to beat it up. Then, we're going to add in our milk and we're\ngoing to continue to beat this all together. And you want to beat it until it's all nice\nand creamy and yellow. And at this point, we're going to add one\ntablespoon of sugar, this makes it taste really good. And we're going to add just a little bit of\nsalt. If you have a measuring thing, you might want\nto use about a quarter of teaspoon of salt, you don't need hardly any at all. And then we need just a sprinkle of cinnamon. And if you want to measure it, about a quarter\nof a teaspoon of cinnamon should be plenty. All right, and we're just going to continue\nto whisk this in here together. Now, before I cook anything on the griddle,\nI'm just going to put down a little bit of butter. If you have non-stick spray, that'll also\nwork. And we're just going to put our butter on\nthe griddle, so our bread won't stick. Then all you need to do is take your bread\nand dip it in, then dip it in, you don't need for it to soak in or anything like that. And you're just going to put it on the griddle,\njust like that. Okay, and you're just going to let these cook\nfor about two, two and a half minutes on each side, they'll get nice and golden brown. Now, if it's cooking faster than that, turn\ndown your heat because it's up too high. If you're using just a regular electric stove\nor a gas stove, I would put it on between low and medium, so it doesn't cook too fast,\nnobody likes burnt French toast. So after about another minute or so, we're\ngoing to flip these over and let them cook on the other side. So we flipped over our French toast and it's\ncooked now on the second side for a couple of minutes. And now I'm just going to go ahead and take\nthese off. And here you go, you have a great big stack\nof French toast, and wasn't that easy to make! So please give this video a big thumbs up. And if you're learning how to cook, maybe\na comment down below and tell me what you'd like to cook and I will help you learn how\nto cook that recipe. Thanks for watching! ",

        "content": "to make these delicious french toast roll-ups you're going to need some eggs some fresh strawberries some chip chocolate peanut butter some white bread and some cinnamon sugar so the first thing you're going to do is take a few of your fresh strawberries and slice them up very thin because if you don't do it since then the bread is going to fall apart Nia then you're just going to crack three eggs into a bowl design it out a little bit I took a half of a shot glass and filled it with water and poured it in and then I just whisked it all together then you just take some bread however much you want to do and start cutting off the crusts of it into a perfect square then you take the jib chocolate peanut butter and start spreading Matt a little bit over each piece then you just start adding a couple pieces of the strawberries don't have too many or the bread will fall apart when you try to roll it up very gently and carefully start trying to roll up the piece of bread and if it starts falling apart you can just kind of pinch it back together then just get an empty plate and sprinkle cinnamon sugar all over it carefully roll the bread and the egg yolk and then move it to the cinnamon sugar and rollin put the stove on medium carefully place on in the frying pan and let them cook for just a couple minutes when they're done you can just take them out of the pan and put them on a plate for them to cool and then if you choose you can add just a little bit of whipped cream on top so here's the finished product I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video if you'd like to see more cooking videos from me then like this video and please subscribe to my channel ",

        "content": "Mmm. Who doesn\u2019t like a nice big plate of\nFrench toast? Nice firm bread soaked in eggs with milk, maybe garnished with a little bit\nof fresh fruit, some cinnamon and slathered over the top with maple syrup. Have you ever\nwondered where this dish came from? What genius mind created it and who throughout history\nsavored this delectable dish? Well that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to look at today in 18th\nCentury Cooking with Jas. Townsend and Son. We\u2019re wrapping up our second series of 18th\nCentury Cooking with Jas. Townsend and Son. Most recently we\u2019ve been looking at 18th\ncentury breads and we thought it would be appropriate to conclude this series with a\nlittle sweet treat made with bread. The earliest recipe for French toast can be\nfound in the Apicius. It\u2019s a 4th and 5th century collection of Roman recipes. The dish\nis simply titled A Sweet Treat and the translation reads thus, \u201cBreak a slice of fine white\nbread, crust removed, into rather large pieces, soak in milk and beat in eggs, fry in oil,\ncover in honey, and serve.\u201d Bread was known as a staff of life. It was\na dietary pillar, but what does one do when one\u2019s bread goes stale? In an old English\ncookbook from about 1430, we find a recipe for bread that\u2019s sliced, dipped in eggs,\nfried in butter and then sprinkled with a little bit of sugar. The name of this recipe\nwas Payn perdu, a French word that means lost bread or wasted bread, suggesting that this\nrecipe was meant to use up stale bread. Karen Hess who transcribed Martha Washington\u2019s\nBooke of Cookery has this to say in a recipe after Payn Perdu. It says, \u201cThe English\nearly took to Payn Perdu and made it their own. It was rarely omitted from a cookbook,\nusually listed under made dishes. Made dishes are any dish that amuses the cook or shows\noff her skill.\u201d Let\u2019s make French toast or Payn Perdu in\na true 18th century fashion. We\u2019re going to start off with a nice enriched\nbread. The no knead French bread like we made in our last episode would be perfect. If you\nwant to use a more modern bread, you can use a challah bread or a brioche, any firm bread\nwill do. We\u2019ve cut the crust off this and we\u2019ve\nlet it set out overnight, so we\u2019re starting off with a nice stale bread. I\u2019m going to\nstart off here with about 8 egg yolks and to that I\u2019m going to add about a cup of\ncream and I\u2019m also going to add some wine, some sac here. We\u2019re going to use about\na quarter of a cup. Now I\u2019m going to add about two tablespoons of sugar and finally\nI\u2019m going to scrape in a little bit of nutmeg and we\u2019ll whisk this all together. Now let\u2019s take our individual bread pieces\nand put them in the batter. I\u2019m going to let these set for maybe 15\nminutes or up to an hour to get this a real good chance to soak in. It really depends\non how stale your bread is. While these toasts are steeping, I\u2019m going to go ahead and\nstart on our sauce, because we want to have the sauce ready to put on it as soon as they\u2019re\ncooked. We\u2019re going to start off with about four\ntablespoons of butter and then once that\u2019s melted, let\u2019s add in about two tablespoons\nof sac, and after the sac we\u2019re going to add about a tablespoon of sugar. Now you want to whisk this all together, then\nyou want it to get nice and warm, but we\u2019re really not cooking it, we\u2019re just really\nmixing it together, so what I\u2019m going to do is set this aside where it\u2019ll stay nice\nand warm waiting for us to put it on. I\u2019ve got the butter going in the pan, let\u2019s\nput in our toasts. If your bread\u2019s really stale, sometimes it can be very fragile so you might have to be careful as you put it in the pan. These look done. Let\u2019s get them out of here. Here\u2019s our Payn Perdu, an early version\nof French toast. Let\u2019s give it a try. Mmm. That is excellent. This topping\u2019s a\nlittle different from what you and I might expect or what we\u2019re used to. Very nice.\nRight out of the 18th century cookbooks. Maple syrup as a topping is a perfect North American\nvariation on that same theme. They\u2019re substitute for sugar, maple syrup. Excellent.\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this episode of 18th Century Cooking with Jas. Townsend and Son.\nBe sure to watch for more episodes in the near future.

This topping\u2019s a\nlittle bit different than what you and I mi(cough)\u2026 Here I get it stuck in my throat and I can\u2019t\ntalk. {Beep} Have you ever wondered where this comes from?\nI have.

        "original_title": "Make French Toast",
        "content": "Hi, I\u2019m Chef Tony Matassa. Today we are preparing an epic french toast\nbreakfast sandwich on our Lynx Asado Griddle. Now for the french toast, I like to pick up\na couple loaves of country white bread, and make thick slices of toast, about 2 inches\nthick. I place the slices in the oven at 300 degrees\nfor a few minutes so that they can crisp up a bit. For the french toast batter, start by combining\ncorn starch with some confectioners sugar and sift it into a mixing bowl. Here I have 6 egg yolks and 4 whole eggs,\ngive this a good whisk and add in a couple teaspoons of vanilla extract. Once combined, pour this mixture into a mixing\nbowl, and whisk the ingredients to combine. Now to sweeten up the batter, I like to use\nhoney because it gives nice flavor to the french toast, and helps to emulsify the batter. Finish this off with some melted butter that\nhas cooled, followed by some half and half. It's time to give the slices of toast a dunk\nin the batter, make sure to coat both sides well, you'll be glad you did! Go ahead and heat up your griddle to medium-\nhigh heat and throw some butter on there, because butter and french toast is always\na great combo! After a minute or two, the first side should\nhave some good color on it, you can go ahead and flip to the other side. These are looking great, I'll go ahead and\nremove them to a pan and grill up the rest of the sandwich ingredients\u2026 and where would\nthis french toast sandwich be without some thick cut bacon? No worries, there will be some eggs and cheese\ntoo, but I like to get a good coating of bacon fat on the griddle before the eggs. I always love cooking up bacon on a griddle\nlike this, because I just can't fit all the bacon I want in one pan! Once the bacon is good and crispy, it's time\nto scramble some eggs for this sandwich. Luckily eggs cook quick, because I am pretty\nready to dive into this french toast sandwich! It's time to build this monster! Start out by setting down a slice of french\ntoast.. followed by some scrambled eggs.. a slice of colby jack cheese.. now for the\nbacon, nothing says breakfast like the combination of syrup and bacon.. but why stop there? Why not infuse bacon into the syrup itself?? This is really easy to make, I cooked down\na half lb. Of bacon, chop it into bits, and heated up\na cup of maple syrup with the bacon bits for a few minutes, then just cool and let it infuse\novernight. After a drizzle of bacon syrup, go ahead and\nadd the top layer of french toast.. and you'll want to and top the whole thing with bacon\nsyrup, because.. why not?

You prep at the night before and slip them\non to the griddle the next morning, perfect for a weekend brunch or holiday breakfast. Let's make the filling first. Place half of an 8-ounce package of soft and\ncream cheese in a medium bowl, add 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Then beat the filling until it's smooth. Next, cut four 1-1/2-inch thick slices of\nChallah, Italian or French bread. Use day old bread if you have it as it'll\nsoak up an optimal amount of custard for the best French toast. Cut a pocket in each bread slice. And then fill the pocket with the cream cheese\nmixture. Arrange the slices in a 3/4 rectangular baking\ndish. Set it aside. Crack 4 eggs into a medium bowl. Then add 1 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of honey\nor sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Whisk this until it's well-blended. Now pour the mixture over the bread slices\ncovering the tops of the bread. Cover the baking dish and chill for 2 to 24\nhours. You'll want to turn the bread slices once\nor twice during the chilling time. Just before serving, please set griddle over\nmedium heat and grease it lightly. Cook the bread slices until they're golden\nbrown. It takes about 2 to 3 minutes for each side. Flip them and cook the other side. For a finishing touch, dust the stuffed French\ntoast with a little confectionary sugar and serve it with maple syrup. ",

        "content": "hi welcome to hot chocolate heads I'm medica and today I'm going to show you how to make french toast doughnuts these are not doughnuts that are made into french toast it's our french toast that tastes like doughnuts because ever so often you get this strong craving for like a good sugar doughnut and often times okay like especially like at midnight when you get those cravings you can't go out and buy doughnuts because you won't get the best ones so today I'm going to show you how to make a super simple version to satisfy that craving this recipe is actually nigella lawson's recipes I'm really excited about making it because it's so so good so let's get started so you want to start by slicing two slices of bread in half you can do this either horizontally or vertically or diagonally have four you'd like now this serves one person so you only need two slices of bread but if you double the recipe you can serve two people so once you've sliced your bread into four halves you're going to take a shallow dish and into that dish you're going to crack one whole egg and my yolk was surprisingly orange which is kind of strange but you know that's what you get and you're going to add one tablespoon of whole milk or half milk or whatever kind of milk you like could also use heavy cream and of course you're going to add in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and this really gives the french toast that doughnut flavor that you want and then you just want to beat all these ingredients together until they are slightly frothy and well combined then in the skillet or a saucepan you're going to melt about half a tablespoon of butter you can use salted or unsalted I like to use salted just because it adds a nice hint of salt to the french toast and then you're going to dip the halves of the bread into the egg mixture you can do this using your fingers or you can use a fork and just make sure that that bread really absorbs the egg mixture you just want to make sure that the bread kind doesn't disintegrate in the egg mixture because then it's going to be nearly impossible to transfer which you're going to do right now so just transfer the house to the pan with the melted butter and cook and I like to do this about two at a time just because my skin this small but if you have a bigger one you can do more at a time just cook them for about 30 seconds on each side and then flip them over and what you're looking for is that beautiful golden color that you know and love in a french toast but that you also know and love in a donut and now for the best part you're going to transfer the halves of the french toast one at a time into a shallow dish or plate covered in powdered sugar you can also use superfine or caster sugar but I feel like if you use granulated sugar which was the only kind of sugar I head aside from powdered sugar you'll get that gritty flavor and I don't like a gritty flavor when I you don't answer when I eat french toast so I think that powdered sugar actually replicates a sugar donut really really well just the only thing is that powder trigger has a tendency to melt really quickly so you might have to double dip it or you might have to eat it right immediately after you've dipped it I know essentially you have donuts plain but I love to serve these with some fresh strawberries or fruit and enjoy them for breakfast so you can serve these any way you want to with some chocolate syrup with some maple syrup although I don't know why you'd add more sugar because it's already showed up I just like to serve them with some fresh strawberries so now I'm going to give them a taste that certainly satisfies my doughnut craving I must say so it does taste like it's kind of in the middle of a french toast and a donut it has lots of vanilla extract and I believe that it's the vanilla extract that really makes it taste like a doughnut but you don't have to wait for all that time to let the dough rise you can just make these like instantly they take five minutes to make and they're so delicious I really hope you give this a try and guess what it's almost donut day national donut day or whatever so if you are interested in making a really cool-looking donut you can check out some videos from other tastemade members they show you how to make some awesome doughnuts so I hope you check those out too but if you want an instant version make this don't forget to rate comment and subscribe and I will see you next time goodbye ",

on skewers it's going to be super fun to eat and this recipe is actually a recipe I learned from my mom because on the weekends when I was a kid she would make french toast pretty regularly and I remember just sitting on the counter watching her make it and that's how I learned how to make this she never told me anything I just learned by watching so for this recipe you will need some bread and I prefer using a thickly sliced bread just because I think it tastes better and it's more fun to eat and then I also have some powdered sugar 3 eggs some fresh blueberries i also have fresh strawberries a little bit of vanilla extract a splash of milk about a tablespoon of coconut oil a little bit of cinnamon i have some skewers here so we have a place to put our french toast when we're finished and then some pure maple syrup alright so i'm going to start off by making the wet mixture for the bread to be dipped into so i'm going to take my three eggs and just plop them in the bowl like that and i like to give them a little whisk before I add anything else in just so the yolks are broken then I'm adding in a splash of milk and this is almond milk my mom would make this recipe with regular milk so you can use whatever milk you want because it really doesn't make that much of a difference I just like almond milk so that goes in give that another little mix now I like using a whisk when I'm making eggs like this because I find that they just come out fluffier and nicer but you can also use a fork I just think a whisk is a little bit better so there's a dip for ya so now I'm just gonna add in a little baby splash of vanilla extract then I'm going to give this another mix and now I personally like quite a bit of cinnamon because I'm a huge fan of cinnamon but you can just leave this up to your personal preference I'm going to put all of this cinnamon in them cuz i really like it so that's just a hefty pinch right there and then it just mix it all up and this smells really really good it actually makes me think of childhood weekends this smell because my mom made this all the time okay everything is all mixed together so I'm just going to go back here and heat up a pan with a little bit of the coconut oil and you can also use butter for this if you don't have coconut oil I just prefer using this because when it melts it infuses into the bread and you get a little bit of that coconut flavor which i think is really nice the coconut oil has melted so now I'm just going to dip these pieces of bread into the egg mixture and you want to make sure that they're fully coated but you don't want them to be so soaking wet that they just get really soggy because then you're just going to end up with mushy french toast and you want it to be crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside so I'm just going to put that down and I'm just gonna keep doing the same thing so this is a recipe that can't be afraid to get your hands dirty with so just kind of have to go for it there we go a little sizzle sound that I love I'm gonna let these guys cook and I like to flip just once you don't want to keep flipping things over you really just want them to be able to cook thoroughly on one side flip it and it's good to go so it usually takes about a couple minutes on each side our french toast is ready to go so now I'm just going to take these slices and I like to find ones that are somewhat even so when I slice them up into pieces they kind of stay consistent all across the board so I'm just takin a good knife it helps if you have a nice sharp knife for this because otherwise your bread is just gonna get smushed and that's not fun is it no it's not so you just pretty much want like little cubes like this just whoops oops just bite sized pieces that are easy for people to eat and I think this is actually a really great party food I made this for a big brunch that I was having it was for a friend's birthday and I needed to make a lot of food for a lot of people very quickly so i decided that i wanted to do french toast but i needed an easier way to serve them so putting them on the skewers allows people to just grab skewers and you get the fruit the french toast you don't have to worry about cutlery or anything people can just eat them straight off the skewers or you can just pick them off with your hands dip them in some maple syrup it's super easy and it's a great thing for kids too so this is a nice way to present french toast that works out for everyone including the person hosting I have my mountain of french toast now this is actually really exciting just having a mound of french toast but basically what we're going to do is we're going to take a skewer like this and just layer on french toast strawberries and blueberries it's pretty simple and it's fun to just make sure that you don't stab yourself with a skewer so you can really put this on in any order that you want I usually like doing a few blueberries like this and then I'll come in with let's do another piece of french toast I'm just winging it here and then I'll come in with a strawberry section and if you're really in a hurry you don't have to worry about cutting up your fruit at all you could stick whole strawberries on here and it would totally work so i think i'm doing the three pieces of fruit and then a piece of french toast method today you can also use different fruits for this so i would recommend going with whatever is in season right now since it's summertime berries are amazing but you could also use bananas you could use pineapple really any fruit tastes good with french toast so i feel like you can't go wrong but this looks really awesome and I'm really happy because it ended up being nice and even here at the bottom but basically I'm just going to keep doing that and just creating a bunch of little skewers putting these varies on these skewers makes me think of my friends because my friends are the best and the worst in the kitchen because they're the best because they're just awesome friends but when they get near a kitchen they start picking at everything that I'm making and I'll just walk by and suddenly food will be missing but I feel like I used to do that as a kid so maybe now I'm getting payback but I think it's pretty funny that my friends will do that when I'm cooking they come over and they'll just start snacking on my ingredients and I'm like wait I i'm pretty sure i had a lot more strawberries than that and now they're all gone our french toast skewers are almost good to go because I like to serve these with a little bit of maple syrup and I normally have the maple syrup on the side just in a little container like this and that allows people to put on as much or as little as they want and it also prevents the skewers from getting soggy so that's just a little tip for you guys because if you do pour it over the top everything just kind of turns into soup and it's not fun so then the very last thing this is actually my favorite part I like to sprinkle a little bit of powdered sugar this over the top like this because it's like it's snowing and it just makes it look really pretty and it adds a little bit of sweetness as well just like that now I've powdered sugar all over me oh just the epitome of the epitome of grace right here that's me well guys that's going to be it for today I'm pretty excited about my french toast q errs because I think they're super yummy and they're a great thing that you can share with friends and family if

Now we re going to add a couple of eggs and give it a robust\nwhisk. Now were going to add a little butter and a bit of oil to a nonstick pan and get\nthat under medium heat, guys. Let the butter melt and now we are going to dunk our white\nbread in the egg mixture and place it in the pan. The longer you dunk, the more mixture\ngets soaked in. Personally I don t like it too soaked. You can use any type of bread\nyou like, it s your kitchen do what you want. So, all we are doing here in waiting for one\nside to brown up, flip and brown up the other side. Then you can top it anyway you want.\nFruit, powdered sugar, maple syrup and butter. I always like French toast with sausage. The\nlink to the recipe is in the description box below. OK, that s about it, Please share this\nvideo guys, and if you want to keep cooking with me please subscribe. You all have a fantastic\nday, Chef Kendra is out. Peace. ",

        "content": "Hey Cookaholics Chef Kendra Here and today\nI'm teaming up with Rosie from I Heart Recipes. We thought we'd drop some cool stuff you can\nserve for Easter Brunch. Heck Yeah, she is hooking up some amazing\nOrange Rolls. So make sure you all go check Rosie's channel. I'll toss up the link at the end of this video\nand it'll also be in the ABOUT SECTION below. I'm offering up some stuffed French toast. So, let's do what we do, head into the kitchen\nand make this happen. OK, we have our stuff waiting for us. I'm slicing some brioche into some nice thick\npieces. If you can't find brioche just use some quality\nFrench bread. However brioche is much better for this dish. This is fresh baked. I'm using a small knife to cut straight down\ninto the bread on the top and I'm going to do the same thing on the bottom creating a\nnice place for our filling to live. Just like so. Speaking of filling we're sliding some cream\ncheese into our bowl and we're going to add some powdered sugar and some vanilla. We're going to roughly mix this together with\na folk, then use our electric mixer to finish the job because we don't want a powdered sugar\nbath, now do we? The smart thing is to use a pastry bag or\nbaggie to pipe the filling in. I'm stuffing these boys with this butter knife. Don't judge me. We're whisking eggs, salt and milk together\nin this bowl for our French bread batter. We have a towel under our bowl for stability. Now we're going to get a pan under medium\nlow heat. Add a little butter and some oil. This is similar to a grill cheese as in you\ndon't want to cook it so fast the inside doesn't get hot and melty. Is melty a word? It is now. We're going to dip our brioche stuffed goodness\ninto our French toast batter and make magic. If you like a really soaked piece of French\ntoast dip it for a longer, if not a quick dip is cool. It's your kitchen do what you want. We've slide in our pan and we're just going\nto cook until it's reached it's golden brown perfection, flip this boy and repeat on the\nother side. We're going to remove it from the pan and\nfancy it up a bit for serving. I'm slicing some strawberries here but really\nyou can have a toppings bar, powdered sugar, maple syrup, honey, blueberries, raspberries,\ncompotes or jams. Be creative, guys. I'm going with, as you can see whipped cream,\npowdered sugar and sliced strawberry. I cut this guy in half so you can see the\ntasting filling poking out. I have a homemade powder sugar video and a\nvideo on how to make homemade whipped cream you can click the links to look at those. Make sure you check out Rosie's Channel, I\nheart recipes. Share my videos and if you haven't already,\nSubscribe. Chef Kendra is out. Peace. ",

        "content": "Hi, I\u2019m Chef Tony Matassa. Today we are preparing an epic french toast\nbreakfast sandwich on our Lynx Asado Griddle. Now for the french toast, I like to pick up\na couple loaves of country white bread, and make thick slices of toast, about 2 inches\nthick. I place the slices in the oven at 300 degrees\nfor a few minutes so that they can crisp up a bit. For the french toast batter, start by combining\ncorn starch with some confectioners sugar and sift it into a mixing bowl. Here I have 6 egg yolks and 4 whole eggs,\ngive this a good whisk and add in a couple teaspoons of vanilla extract. Once combined, pour this mixture into a mixing\nbowl, and whisk the ingredients to combine. Now to sweeten up the batter, I like to use\nhoney because it gives nice flavor to the french toast, and helps to emulsify the batter. Finish this off with some melted butter that\nhas cooled, followed by some half and half. It's time to give the slices of toast a dunk\nin the batter, make sure to coat both sides well, you'll be glad you did! Go ahead and heat up your griddle to medium-\nhigh heat and throw some butter on there, because butter and french toast is always\na great combo! After a minute or two, the first side should\nhave some good color on it, you can go ahead and flip to the other side. These are looking great, I'll go ahead and\nremove them to a pan and grill up the rest of the sandwich ingredients\u2026 and where would\nthis french toast sandwich be without some thick cut bacon? No worries, there will be some eggs and cheese\ntoo, but I like to get a good coating of bacon fat on the griddle before the eggs. I always love cooking up bacon on a griddle\nlike this, because I just can't fit all the bacon I want in one pan! Once the bacon is good and crispy, it's time\nto scramble some eggs for this sandwich. Luckily eggs cook quick, because I am pretty\nready to dive into this french toast sandwich! It's time to build this monster! Start out by setting down a slice of french\ntoast.. followed by some scrambled eggs.. a slice of colby jack cheese.. now for the\nbacon, nothing says breakfast like the combination of syrup and bacon.. but why stop there? Why not infuse bacon into the syrup itself?? This is really easy to make, I cooked down\na half lb. Of bacon, chop it into bits, and heated up\na cup of maple syrup with the bacon bits for a few minutes, then just cool and let it infuse\novernight. After a drizzle of bacon syrup, go ahead and\nadd the top layer of french toast.. and you'll want to and top the whole thing with bacon\nsyrup, because.. why not? Oh, and don't forget the final garnish of\nbutter and powdered sugar! Now I could stare at this all day, but I'm\npretty hungry so let's dig in! Phenomenal flavor combo.. bacon.. french toast..\nbacon maple syrup.. forget about it! Thank you for watching, I hope you enjoyed\nit and I hope if you have any questions on the Lynx Asado grill, you\u2019ll give us a call\nor check us out online today. I\u2019m Chef Tony Matassa, and remember.. at\nBBQGuys.com, we SMOKE the competition! ",
