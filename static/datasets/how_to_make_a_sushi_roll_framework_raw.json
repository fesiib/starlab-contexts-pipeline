        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "in this video I'm going to show you how to roll sushi when it comes to rolling sushi there are two schools of thought there is a squared school of thought and the circular school of thought now both are great it doesn't really matter I mean just whatever you prefer to roll is what you should do I like to mix and match because then I do one roll in one way another rolled all the way it adds a bit of diversity on the plate you know I mean you can make beautiful colorful rolls and you could also have them different shapes which makes it quite interesting to look at instead of just having the same plain shape once you decide to go circular or squared the next option is half sheet or full sheet now a full sheet is easier because most people when they try to make a sushi roll they over stuff the roll and then you won't be able to close it now by using a full sheet you can use pretty much as much filling as you want and you'll be more or less guaranteed you should always be able to close it the half a sheet nori sushi roll is what is normally made in most sushi restaurants you simply take a whole sheet of nori and you just fold it in half and then just split and you just use half a sheet of nori I suggest so just this now the reason why this is used in most sushi restaurants is because you're using way less nori let's start with and that saving costs it's quite efficient to roll it you it's pretty fast and what produces a nice square roll okay so now how to do it what I'm doing here is I'm sweating out 150 grams of cooked sushi rice or five ounces of cooked sushi rice over half a sheet of nori now you simply spread it out nice and softly don't overdo it just that's fine it doesn't have to be perfect you just want to get a nice spread over it later when you roll the roll it spreads out the rice more evenly and compress you just add your avocado and well it just doesn't matter the filling so I'm adding here so avocados and salmon and you just simply lift up the back turn it over the filling keeping with your other fingers here the contents in the roll and then turning it over and pushing it in like so then you just turn it over like so and now you firm it up with a bamboo rolling mat now I like to do is turn on one side then firm it up again and turn it back to the original position and firm it up one more time you want to fully cover the sheet of nori and now you want to flip it over you want to place it on top of your bamboo rolling mat with a plastic bag over it now you bring it towards the end here like so you do a little bit of space and you add your filling in this case just some crab sticks and look at the cucumber this is just a show and now you begin the rolling just bring up the back of the mat so you roll it forwards holding in the filling with your fingers and then you press in this way towards yourself applying pressure on the back and filling it up like a square this gives us the square shape by holding the sushi mat in the square shape now you detach push it forward over to the next phase and then just firm up that square face now you do the same to make sure the roll is completely done and that's it and now just apply pressure from the sides and then pressure on the bottle now you do this with both hands and using the index finger to press down and that creates a square draw now rolling it you can roll it either away from yourself or towards yourself I don't really care as long as just roll it now most sushi chefs and restaurants they roll it away from them keeping the incompetence of the roll in with their fingers and rolling over with the thumb okay now I when I started out I used to like rolling it towards me and controlling the content with my thumbs and rolling it up forward this way I could have visual contact with the food as you're rolling it and you could see whatever was going on correct it now the other way you can't you have to curve over and look down underneath and it's not as practical I would say for beginners you probably want to start rolling towards yourself just to get some confidence and when you can flip it over and turn it around and do it get away from yourself now I would say the best method is with a plastic bag around like so it does get a little bit strange sometimes but if you just leave a little gap in a corner so don't completely seal it that allows some air to flow in and out and then you can get the compression or if you could somehow vacuum steal this so you just completely have no air inside so the rolling mat is just tight okay so this is the best method and if your rice still sticks to the plastic what you want to do is just run this under a tub of cold water and even though there is no water on the plastic that you can see there are microscopic particles between the plastic and whatever you place on it so when the rice comes in contact with it it actually doesn't stick to it the key to making sushi and not having the right stick to your hands or anything around you is to have just a little bit of water just before you touch the rice to it so either way cutting it rolling it or touching it with your hands even just to grab some rice you want to always have them slightly damp not wet but just you know a little moist all right the basics of how to roll a simple Maki roll is you just take your rice you spread it out but you leave a little gap about three quarters of an inch long which would be about 1.5 centimeters okay so just simply spread it out and leave an imaginary line here where no rice comes over now you place your filling in this case a little sliver of tuna in the middle of said rice and then you simply bring it over now you can do this you can draw this either by hand or with the help of a rolling mat now in the case of the rolling mat just simply place it over bring the back end of the nori towards the end of the rolling mat and you leave the empty side away from you now you roll it over and you close it so the seaweed paper me to see you paper there's no rice okay and then you simply roll it over okay and there you go and this is how you make a simple squared mac book I think you just find the style of sushi rolling which suits you and just have fun doing it ",

        "content": "[Music] welcome to TV Tuesdays my name is Franz from beyond the p.m. today I'm really excited to show you how to make some sushi rolls now I'm not even gonna use rough fish so you but anything you have in your fridge in a sushi roll that's the brilliance of it you don't even need to buy really anything specific except for two things this thing which cost about 99 cents and it's a little stretchy and it's a miracle sushi roller and you need seaweed so seaweed is very good for you and often a whole bunch of links as to why and all that good stuff um in the post but this is what it looks like and it is one ingredient on the package so should be anything more it's just dried seaweed that's it so it's really really showing the human side not so shiny on the other side so we're gonna push on each side down and I usually don't need the whole sheet but you know if you're just learning and practicing you can use the whole sheet but I'll just I always get rid of an inch and a half of mine that just rips so it's pretty easy to use alright and then you can use this for other stuff later okay so there you go I got my sushi sheet no it's really cool about sushi is that you don't have to use nasty white sushi rice I actually like sushi rice but we're talking about like nutritional content not great but you can use anything you want you could use quinoa if you wanted I'm using a spread of brown rice you could use wild rice users anything the only thing you need to do a little differently is that needs to be a little sticky and so how I make my rice quinoa whatever mixture sticky is I add a little bit extra water during the cooking time and cook it a little longer that makes it nice and sticky so there you have it so I've got my little piece of paper because this is sticky little trick you wet your hands when you put stuff down and you just leave enough of an opening on one side like an inch that's not covered by rice so that it can seal so now when you start to stick you just put your hands in the water okay you just lay it flat like that okay so it filled it up I left myself like a little nice one inch and a half gap there at the end nice even layer now we get to fill it with whatever I want so I have some of the some I have a mixture left over from the cashew squash salad so there will be a link there for this avocado yogurt because I'm not using mayonnaise today and I added some asabi in that so you'll have a link to that put a little layer at the bottom you don't have to use any of this you can use some of this so you can do whatever you want okay and then I just julienned some veggies I'm using colorada because I had some I needed to use up and it's super healthy for you I've got some greens or some carrots sorry for a little color and crunch a little cucumber I always like to add some zesty green onion and then maybe we'll put in some avocado yumminess and then I actually have some sprouts too this is not something you normally see in sushi but that doesn't matter because like I said that's what's so great about sushi you put whatever you want in it if you have apples and avocados in your fridge you can do that you can do anything you like alright so here's the trick here's the rolling part and this is why this little bamboo mat is so important first off you're sticking your fingers kind of like in the in the stuffing you want to contain it inside as you go over and you're gonna continue I had stuffed mine quite a bit so I don't have a ton of overhanging but this is the trick nice tight pull now if you can see that in the video but I'm pulling it around making it nice and tight sometimes I like to have a little water just on the seam there so that it seals up nice and tight especially if I don't have a ton of overhang again it's just a nice nice pole and when you do that you'll see that there's some elasticity there and there and then you grow there's a sushi roll nice and tight I did pull a little too tight so you can see there's a little tear there but that's not a big deal in that case you could always use things like this to seal it up you know this stuff is super sticky a little how to fix your mistakes everyone needs to know that and this stuff just it's like a like a second skin and of course if you don't pull too tight then you won't have to do this but there's my fix done pretty easy and happens really quick and like I said the best part is that you just you can do whatever ingredient you want the ends are always a little ugly so I always put those flat down so you can't see them it's my little hive and that's it it just slice and serve so there you have it super super easy sushi rolls you can fill with just about anything so leave me a comment below and tell me what you're gonna put in your sushi roll next time and if you're not already a subscriber you can subscribe to our e-mail updates by going to beyond the pail dotnet and we look forward to seeing you and we'll see you next Tuesday [Music] she [Laughter] ",

        "content": "hey guys my name is Brian skinny from secrets of sushi comm and in this video I'm going to show you guys how to make in the hopper roll this roll actually comes as a special request from my good friend Melissa slaughter who's one of the founders of the hopper magazine this recipe was specifically created to celebrate their one-year anniversary so congratulations happy mag if you guys haven't had a chance to check out one of their magazines yet click on the link in the description box below the hopper roll recipe is my spin on a traditional Hawaiian dish called musubi the first thing we want to do for this recipe is to pair our vegetables so I have a red bell pepper here and what I want to do in order to prepare this for the sushi roll is to remove the stem and to cut the sides off of the bell pepper next I want to lay the freshly cut portion of the red bell pepper face down and I'm gonna cut the bell pepper into slices after that bell pepper has been cut into strips I'm gonna set on a plate next to me and next I'm gonna cut an avocado with the avocado I want to set it to where the long portion is perpendicular to the bottom of the cutting board and I'm gonna take my knife and slice down until I reach the pit once I've hit the pit I'm gonna pick the avocado up I'm gonna point my knife straight up and down I'm gonna very carefully and slowly slide the avocado up the knife but not allowing the tip of the knife to go into the avocado itself next while holding my knife perfectly still I'm gonna rotate my avocado down the knife until it reaches the bottom this is a good way to make sure that you're starting cut lines up with your ending cut I'm going to grab on to the two halves and twist them in opposite directions and then pull them apart next I'm going to set the half of the avocado with the pit still attached onto my cutting board I'm going to very carefully hold on to just enough of the avocado so it doesn't rock back and forth and I'm gonna take my knife and firmly chop it into the pit of the avocado the next time I pick the avocado up again and twist my knife in the opposite direction that I twist the half of the avocado this easily removes the pit next I'm going to take my fingers and without touching the edge of the knife I'm going to place them on the flat part of the blade and then pull straight out to remove the pit from my knife next I'm gonna hand peel my avocado once the avocado has been peeled I'm gonna set the flat portion of the kado facedown on the cutting board and I'm gonna use a knife to slice the avocado into very thin slices now the key to slicing avocado very thinly is that most people initially want to take their knife and chop straight down in the avocado but you'll notice that the avocado slice sticks to the side of your knife however if you set the tip of your knife onto the cutting board and draw straight back you have a cut a slice tends to stay in place this is the best technique that I've found to be able to quickly and accurately slice avocado into very thin slices once your avocado has been cut you can slide the avocado into your hand and make sure that pieces are running left to right and then using both hands you can use your thumbs to push the avocado away from you the stagger the pieces out I find that when you fan the avocado slices like this it makes it a lot easier to grab individual slices of avocado when you're assembling your roll now that all of our ingredients have been cut we're ready to cut our funnest ingredient which is pineapple the first thing we want to do is to remove the top a leafy part of the pineapple next we're going to move the bottom portion of the pineapple and now that the pineapple is flipped on its side we get to remove the outside skin of the pineapple now there's two schools of thought on removing the skin the first one is that you cut very deeply so let's you make sure that you remove all the islets and the second school of thought is you can actually make more shallow thin cuts and then you remove the individual eyes later I personally prefer the second school of thought because it preserves more of the actual pineapple itself and isn't quite waste as much go ahead and remove the entire skin of your pineapple okay now we remove all the skin from the pineapple you can notice that a lot of these islets are actually going in a diagonal pattern across the pineapple so what you can view is use a paring knife or a serrated steak knife and actually cut a v-shape into the pineapple to remove the eyelet this part can be pretty tricky so make sure that you go slow once you're very careful not to cut your hand all right now remove all the eyes from our pineapple we have this fun spiral design going throughout a pineapple and the last thing we need to do is to cut this hard core off the pineapple so what I'm gonna do is actually just cut a square around the actual core the pineapple itself now we can set a pineapple on a plate and put it aside and the last thing that we need to prepare is our spam that's right musubi is made out of spam open your can of spam up and then flip it over and we want to cut our spam into very thin slices now spam is already cooked but I want to marinate the spam and then grill it so what I've done is I've put a quarter of a cup of soy sauce a quarter of a cup of oyster sauce and half a cup of sugar into this cup red container and mix that all together until the sugar dissolved and this is what I'm gonna marinate the slices of spam in for about five minutes or so before i grill it okay now that we have all of our ingredients cut and grilled I only get to talk about making hapa rice so hapa rice is supposed to be half brown rice half white rice but brown rice requires twice as much water to cook as sushi rice does so what I had to do was prepare my sushi rice separately for my brown rice after my sushi rice had been seasoned and has cooled down to room temperature and my brown rice had finished cooking and also cooled down to room temperature what I've done is added one cup of sushi rice and half a cup of brown rice so the sushi rice is seasoned with rice wine vinegar salt and sugar but the brown rice is not seasoned with anything at all I chose to go with twice as much sushi rice as brown rice because I want to make sure that we maintain that sticky consistency of the rice when we start applying it onto the seat so I'm gonna do is use a spatula to combine the two parts of rice to make our hapa rice all right and now we're ready to assemble our hapa roll the first thing you want to do is to grab your bamboo Maki seal which is wrapped in cellophane and you want to make sure the bamboo pieces have the darker flatter side spaced up and are running left and right or parallel to the bottom of your cutting board next you want to take a single piece of nori or seaweed and you want to make sure that the rough textured side is face-up and a glassy slightest face down you want to put that up towards the bottom of your Maki suit with about one inch of space still left at the bottom next you want to take one hand and dip it into your bowl of water and transfer that water onto the hand by rubbing them together the goal here is to make sure your hands are glossy but not dripping with water next you want to take a handful of rice and we're gonna spread it from the center of our nodi out to all four sides it's important that we not use a strong downward pressing motion because that would smash the rice so instead what we're gonna do is use a gentle rolling motion it's important that the rice goes to all four edges of the seaweed in fact it's actually better that their rice goes over the edge then not quite all the way to the edge when you're done your layer of rice should be between three and four grains deep next I'm going to grab the two corners furthest away from me to gently pick up these sushi rice and the seaweed and flip it over next we want to do is to grab a single piece of our grilled musubi or our grilled spam and we're gonna make a couple of slices we want to set our slices in the middle of our seaweed and we want to try to make sure the interior ingredients are as consistent as possible from end to end next you want to add two slices of red bell pepper on the side of the spam furthest away from us next you want to add a few slices of avocado I always recommend placing the avocado on the side of the ingredients that's closest to you and remember the consistency in sushi is the key the reason why I tell my students to place the avocado on the side closest to them it's so that when we go to roll all the ingredients together that the soft avocado has covered first and that the firm pieces of red bell pepper can hold the ingredients in place while we go through the brilliant process to make your sushi we're going to place our two thumbs underneath towards the center of our Maki sieve and we're gonna place our remaining four fingers on the pieces of red bell pepper to hold our ingredients in place next we're gonna curl our thumbs up and over the ingredients all the way until the bottom edge of the Syrian rice are now touching the exposed part of the seaweed it's at this part of the sushi rolling process so we're going to apply the most pressure but instead of pressing down we're actually gonna press it back towards us so we're gonna use the bottom edge of our bamboo Maki soup as sort of a guide and we're gonna scrape that against the exposed part of the nori and we're gonna squeeze back towards us so after we press it back towards us we can lift up the bamboo rolling mat and using one hand I'm gonna pull the band Ouimet away from me and while using the other hand I'm gonna apply just enough downward pressure to make sure that the bamboo mat never leaves the surface of the rice now you can kind of use your fingers to roll the bamboo mat forward and finish the rolling process now the last thing you want to do is to drape the bottom part of the bamboo rolling mat over the top of our sushi and we're gonna take four fingers on one hand and press them down so your fingers are pressing image the two layers of the bamboo rolling mat using one hand to hold the bottom of the mat I'm going to slowly but forcefully roll the bamboo mat back towards me so the objective here is to make sure that we are squeezing out any excess air on the inside of our roll and making sure that all the ingredients are nice and compact so that when we cut the roll it doesn't fall apart now that we have our roll assembled it's time to slice it make sure you have a sharp knife preferably not a serrated edge and I recommend using a Japanese Yanagi bell you can drape a damp rag over the back of the knife and gently wipe the knife off to make sure there's nothing stuck to your knife and also to apply a thin layer of water on your knife so it doesn't stick to the rice nearly as much we want to set our Yanagi be' into the middle of our roll and want to use long back-and-forth sawing motions to cut through our rope once our rules been cut we can stack the two halves next to each other and then we're going to start again on you down the center again and just do long back-and-forth sawing motions repeat that for both halves and now you have eight slice pieces get your hands wet once again and I want you to carefully separate your pieces and set them back into a straight line again now as you can see because we've combined a brown rice with white sushi rice the rice is kind of fraying off of the roll and this is because the brown ranch wasn't seasoned with anything so it has less starch to stick to everything else to fix that we're gonna take our bamboo Maki soup and we're gonna drape the flat darker bamboo pieces over the top of the roll and gently squeeze the roll back together making sure the top of the Maki sue is rounded while the bottom stays flat now we can play our role and I like to stagger my eight pieces into a single line once our role is plated we can cut a few slices of thin grilled pineapple and carefully set a single piece of pineapple onto each piece of sushi thank you guys so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial special shout out to half a magazine for their one-year-anniversary if you guys liked this

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "learn how to make dragon rolls now the first thing you'll need for this is unagi otherwise known as eel and it's really hard to find in the United States so you'll probably have to get some frozen packages like we just show and honestly you might have to microwave it for a minute or two to get it thought but once you do get it out of the package and on your cutting board you want to slice it and the sections like we're showing here at a slight angle and you'll see our Japan housewife is showing that angle right there you want to go ahead and just slice it just like so all the way across and for those of you who have grown up the Western world I'll let you know that some of my students when I was a bad ways to take field trips to go to the river to catch eel I have out of the river and that is certainly not for the squeamish like myself but nonetheless I really do enjoy to eating it on top of my sushi so you can see here we do have to be a little bit careful because when it's not fresh like you can get have to heat it up a little bit it gets a little flaky and if you're not gentle you'll you'll end up just tearing it all apart like some dishes always attend together so there you go you see our housewife is being very careful to be sure to get those cuts the same width and keep them nice and clean and one thing here too that really helps to talk is a nice sharp knife or using a very special knife here that is extremely sharp that's why she's being extra careful and also that's why we're getting such clean cuts even though it may not always look like that so there we are almost at the end there you go that's what you want it to look like right there that's what we're going for so once you have your field cut the next thing we're going to put inside of our sushi is of course cucumber here and we're going to show you how to cut it properly basically it's already cut to the length of the seaweed that we're using from the basement you roll you'll see that knife just glides right through the cucumber and those are the sides of the cuts were looking for right there so our housewives can be kind enough to show us one there we go that's what we're looking for right there and we'll also need crab sticks two will be enough for this one and my favorite the avocado go ahead and slice it this way get those a nice even size cuts to go ahead and put inside our sushi just like so and the avocado cuts up really 3090 use typically what you see this one's comfortable really and the other thing you want to do when you cut your avocado is to go ahead and put lemon on top of it like so fine squeeze lemon juice on top of it that keeps it from turning brown inside of your sushi so when you cut it like so and put the lemon juice on top you're all set to go now the other thing we're we have here is shrimp tempura please see our other video on how to make that we explained how to make that very thoroughly that's what's going to go inside of it as well and here we've already pulled the tails off of the shrimp tempura so it's all ready to go inside so there's no extra steps here that that we need to show and you'll see we're filling out the sushi as best we can to make sure that there's no open spots for someone who gets a piece that's missing any of the ingredients and we'll go ahead here we're just lining up the avocado like so right along there there we go now the next step is roll it up you'll see we're pulling it up and over and we're using our special the specialty rolls like the dragon roll use a smaller rice base and definitely watch another video do that and one of the challenges always to get a rollup nice you can see sometimes it's a little more difficult than it looks to be sure to get all back inside the oval but our Japanese housewife did an excellent job today and there we go that's what we're looking for so you can unwrap it and be sure to get rolled all the way over now the next step is to go ahead and take that eel that we just cut off and lay it across the top like so and there really isn't much of a trick to it you just want to be sure to get a nice even coating of that eel across the top of the sushi there you go and just keep lining it up like so one after another making sure it's even and covering like so radio now once we get to that point the next step is to put a piece of saran wrap over the top and next grab our bamboo Maki thing to go ahead and squeeze the sushi one more time and make sure that the eel is really we don't want to smash it but we want to make sure the whole thing becomes one piece and then we pulled it off here's a little trick we do for these roles we don't do it for all of them as we're going to go ahead and we're going to add sauce now a lot of restaurants do it after you know they make it very aesthetic looking and that's fine for some reason with our dragon rolls we like to go ahead and put on the eel sauce now it's very sweet sauce for those who don't know what it is and then we want to put the saran wrap on again this really helps keep the sauce in the Yale and we we just like run our dragons the more the crazy-crazy course we do and all the guests or house really like that so here the Japan housewife is wiping the knife after each time on a clean rag that has been soaked in the rice vinegar and water mixture that we use to keep our hands uh unsticky that really helps us cut through the saran wrap in the roll like you're seeing here it gives you nice clean cuts it gives you really nice sushi to display after the fact so there you go you see we're just cutting right down the line like so just we get that last little piece to right there and after that we've taken off the saran wrap and we put our rolls out to this away like so and there you go that's the dragon roll and these turned out great we hope you enjoy making it at your house as much as we did enjoy making them at ours thanks for watching we appreciate

        "content": "welcome back to another cooking video I'm chef Devaux and today I'm going to teach you how to make a beautiful sushi roll just like this that has a normal-looking face and then a colorful face it's a piece of sushi engineering unlike anything else out there and I hope you guys enjoy it so let's get cooking let's go alright so we start off by making some pink sushi rice and for that you're going to need to put some frozen raspberries that'll be thought through a sieve now if you have a juicing machine you can also use a juicing machine just to get the raspberry juice not that you can ask more here and basically what I'm just doing is I'm just pressing the thawed raspberries through a sieve and the juice just pours out the bottom now I have to use frozen raspberries because fresh raspberries are too sweet so the frozen want to have a little bit of sourness to it which really complements the sushi rice I'm just going to scrape the bottom off here and now I'm just going to add this to some sushi rice so here's a nice bowl add some cooked and seasoned sushi rice if you don't know how to make cooked and seasoned sushi rice click on the link on top level your screen to go to my website to check it out and learn my recipe I'm just going to add a little bit of this raspberry juice over it and then I'm just going to mix it through now you add a little bit and you add a little bit more later but it's very difficult to take out so just go slowly with it otherwise you get a goopy mess now the technique here is to separate the rice not mash it up you want to make sure the grains of rice still intact so be very careful and just separate the sushi rice and the color will get in between the sushi rice grains so just like this ok so that's that nearly done and now I'm just going to transfer it over to a nice people okay perfect so that's the pink sushi rice done and now I'm going to make the green sushi rice I'm going to take another nice fresh bowl and add some wasabi masago now you can get what size you massaged go online or at a Japanese store but but you're more likely to get it online it comes frozen and you can keep in the freezer for ages and then unfreeze whatever you need and it's a delicious taste now if you can't get your hands on some wasabi Masako what you can use is some coriander which is very delicious taste but it's a very strong case so otherwise you can use some other thing in the screen or maybe just go with a different color you know we just add something else to your rice that's a completely odd color and makes it interesting it doesn't have to be this okay so here I'm just separating it and just nearly done perfect okay I'm just going to transfer this over to another Bowl oh so there we go okay it looks a little bit radio after doesn't okay anyway now I'm just going to take some very thin high-quality nor you need to have high-quality thinner because otherwise it's going to be excessive taste of nori in the sushi roll so ham is going to cut a quarter off it so I have a smaller sheet or you don't need that much and then I'm going to add some my pink sushi rice and you want to cover about half the sheet there okay so just spread it out nice and softly and fluff it out don't press it down don't squish it down you really want to have still nice Airy intact sushi cranes that you really want to taste a separate difference between the sushi rice wings okay so just leave a side on each side about a fingers width and I take the green sushi rice and you spread it out exactly the same way as a pink but on the other half of the sheet okay so just again fluff it out don't press it down too much okay now I'm going to add some cucumber as a placeholder for the salmon later so I'm just going to turn around and then start rolling now you you can roll with a bamboo rolling mat if you're new to it I would recommend it if not you can give this go freehand rolling is is much more difficult but it's doable okay so there we go once you roll it just put it to one side there we go now I'm going to take another sheet and again cut a quarter off it and then just remove it there we go and now I'm going to add some cooked and seasoned white sushi rice about 100 to 120 grams so that's just about 4 ounces or just a little bit less and you spread it out again nice and softly but this time you leave about 2.5 centimeters on one side on it so that's about an inch on one side and then you put your cucumber in the middle the reason for this is I want this to look like a normal Maki roll and on the other side I want to be like spiral so hey I'm just rolling it again use a bamboo 8 if you can't roll freehand and now I'm going to cut it okay I'm going to cut the other one first because had more time to rest and we want to do is wet your knife so the rice is not stick to it as much and then I'm just going to cut it in half okay perfect now I'm going to put the house together and take off the side there which is a little bit excess and it's look bad I'm going to throw those away or eat them and now I'm going to cut this into ten pieces of sushi that's more than usual because I want the sushi roll not to be too fat so I wanted to look realistic because I'm going to put two halves together so here's our it look like and I'm just going to spread them out okay now cut the other white sushi roll in the same way we only need six of them okay so here we go I've got just a few of the sushi roll pieces and I'm just going to cut them in half like this and remove the cucumber core because that's where the salmon is going to go later so just go ahead and cut them in half just like this perfect I remove the cause okay and put them back make sure you don't damage these sushiro pieces because it will ruin the effect again otherwise so you really want to have perfect semi circles without the Keuka okay and just going to show you how to the degree one for good measure here we go okay perfect now what you want to do is just wipe down your board a little bit okay and now you take a nice piece of sushi grade salmon if you don't know sushi grade salmon is check out the link the top left corner screen to see a video in more information and just cut a slice off now this is a bit thick slice I'm just going to recut this again and you want to have it about 1.5 centimeters by 1.5 centimeters by the length of the sushi roll so that's about 3/5 of an inch by 315 inch and the length of the sushi roll I just wipe the board down again and now if you place half a sheet of nori on the board and I'm going to start by laying a pink semicircle down followed by a white semicircle and then another pink semicircle followed by one more white semicircle okay perfect now I'm just going to place my salmon on top of that I'm just going to cut it to size so there's none hanging out of the sides  it you use the other peaceful nursery shroom and now just going to place a green semicircle on top of the pink semicircle just like this and the other beans let me stick on top of the other pink semicircle and then the whites again on top of the whites there we go perfect I'm just going to clean up the poor just a little bit here move this side get clean there anyway now I'm gonna start rolling now you can use a bamboo rolling mat again and I would recommend if you haven't rolled before I'm just going to do it freehand here okay so just make sure it doesn't fall out the sides and then here what you're going to have to do is add a little bit of sushi rice to act like glue because we've got two layers of nori and the moisture come really get through to adhere the nori so it just needs a little bit of help so there we go just going to cut a little bit excess off and perfect okay now I'm just going to leave this here for a second while I clean the board and now I'm going to cut it now you need a very sharp knife and you have to through the white section and then I'm not sure if you can see in the video but I now have to cut through the green section which I can just make out through the noise just slice to it perfect and now you have a perfect half and half look at that beautiful okay now I'm just going to cut again but this time I'm going to cut through the white section which I can just make out and then again we have another perfect half map okay now the last one's a little bit tricky Biggers this only there's not much sushi to hold on to and you could really easily mush it you need an extremely sharp knife like this one and that just about makes it perfect now if you once a knife of I've got here then check out the link by clicking on top left corner screen so extremely sharp knife and it works great kind of sushi bit expensive though okay so just lay them facing up and this perfect way to surprise your guests because when they come and they flip it over they'll just be amazed at your sushi baking skills because it's something that you don't even see in restaurants nobody I've never seen this before ever voila alright so there we go this is the end of the video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did give it a go at home and don't get hit the thumbs up down there now last couple weeks I've been asking your questions to get to know you guys a little bit more and understanding my subscribers and they beat a bit generic so this week I'm just going to ask a random question nothing to do with sushi nothing to do with the channel nothing to do with YouTube just what's the most exciting experience you've ever had in your life now I guess I should go first so I'd say the third most exciting experience I've ever done in my life is skydiving I can tell you the throttle second because this to public is thousands keep watching but anyway so skydiving I remember looking back I expected when I jumped out of the plane to just fall down to earth and then I don't know I didn't expect to yeah so I just expected to fall down to earth which in hindsight was pretty stupid because as soon as you jump out of the plane you start tumbling and those first couple moments I was just in sheer panic I thought I was actually going to die but when I started to level outside calm down so good and then you're just dropping down to earth and you see the horizon on the side and you see the courage of the earth and you just see how massive the planet is compared to you and it's really quite experienced I recommend to anyone and after dropping for a while you just you just wanted to test the parachute out you know making sure those few ropes and a little sheet will actually stop you and yeah that was my skydiving experience in a nutshell so let me know your most exciting experience in a comment section below and I'll be sure to give it a read at least and hopefully if I can then respond to it okay so that's it I hope you guys enjoyed this video check out my other videos by clicking on the right right now and subscribe to my channel if

        "content": "hey everybody I'm going to show you my experience with my first time making a sushi roll so we're gonna go over the steps and I'm going to show you most of my materials this is a sushi rolling mat that I bought at a local market and the first thing that we're going to want to do is to wrap it in saran wrap so that the sushi nori and our other ingredients don't stick it's gonna make it a lot easier to clean up and it's gonna make it much easier to actually go through the whole process so I'm cutting the other end of the saran wrap and we're going to fold it over so that it sticks to itself and then tuck in our edges and I've seen people use a large ziplock bag I did try that at a later attempt and it didn't work so well for me but it might work for you so definitely don't discount it and now that we're finished wrapping our mat we're just going to go ahead and set that aside okay so some of the other ingredients that we're going to be using are a cutting board and knife we're also going to be using our sushi rice and I'll have the website I used at the bottom some water we're also going to be using mayonnaise mixed with wasabi for a little bit of a kick we have some imitation crab meat and our sushi nori which I bought at the same market as the mat and we're also going to be using some cream cheese okay so we're gonna get started by grabbing our sushi mat and our nori and we're gonna be placing our nori on our sushi rolling mat shiny side down sort of setting that up here and shiny side down the next thing that we're going to do is moist in our hands because we don't want the rice to stick to our hands and start to put the rice on to the sushi knowing we're gonna be leaving about an inch of open space at one end now again this is my first time doing it so I did put a lot of rice on in your attempt you could probably cut the amount of rice down by about half you really don't need this much it still tastes really good but it does make it more difficult to roll and your your end result is going to be very thick so the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to be putting on our ingredients and we're gonna start with the wasabi mayonnaise and the reason that I added this was to make sure that it feels kind of moist when you're eating it didn't want just a dry rice roll we're gonna add our cream cheese followed by imitation crabmeat and just break it up with your fingers so that it won't bulk up the roll too much and top it off with some cucumber we're gonna use the mat to lift over the edge and compress the roll and we're gonna moisten the other edge the open edge so that it sticks and push the rest of it over and there's our completed roll so the next thing that we have to do is slice and I like these ceramic knives they're very easy to clean and they cut very very well actually got them at Harbor Freight so that was a cool find so wipe your knife off or rinse your knife between each cut that will make sure that each cut is clean and that you don't Mar your bowl too much or tear your sushi nori and one more slice and the end of the roll goes to the chef and some other variations that you can do include raw tuna and just make sure that you're buying from someone who you know is selling good quality fish because if you're eating it raw you don't want anything that could make you sick any other kind of fillings we used avocados and just play around with it it's actually a lot of fun to experiment so one more slice and then I'm going to show you guys my final result all right thanks so much for watching guys I appreciate it bye bye ",

        "content": "I love sushi I love it so much and after years I've eaten it I decided to teach myself how to make it and now I want to teach you so please enjoy these video tutorials on how to make and here we have the American Dream roll the starter showed the crunchy shrimp tempura along with spicy crab cream cheese and Hass avocado on top start off with the shrimp tempura I buy mine store-bought in the freezer section and heat them up the toaster oven for about 10 or 15 minutes and then you have the creamy Hass avocados to go on top you want to make sure you get a nice ripe one for this and then the cream cheese I use to Philadelphia 30 reduced fat cream cheese and then of course the spicy crab start this roll off I use 2/3 of a sheet of nori now for all my shrimp tempura rolls I use 2/3 of a sheet of nori and it was wet hands take a palm full of such prepared rice and gently press that out to the edge of the seaweed just want to make sure you don't have too much rice on there next we're gonna slice up the cream cheese to add into the roll I always add the cream cheese first this just reduces the amount of mess that you're gonna have if you place it on the bottom and other ingredients on top when you go to roll it up so I just pinch it out make sure it goes to the length of the roll then I add the shrimp tempura now these have been sitting around for a little bit so they're not too hot that's where they melt the cream cheese when you put them in there next I'm gonna add the spicy crab and you're really looking for a nice uniform amount and then the spicy crab is three or four ingredients it depends on your taste mayonnaise sauce sriracha hot sauce and the imitation crab sticks and you see once you take them out of plastic wrap and you peel em they almost become like little strains of spaghetti and you cut them in half Drano make sure you get that excess water out and then I add the mayonnaise and this is for a couple rolls about four rolls five rolls depending on how much you put on there and add the Sorachi hot sauce to taste if you like it hotter add a little bit more so actually hot sauce and then what you're looking for is just a nice consistent amount throughout the entire length of the role that really aids in the presentation and when you go and do that first roll hold it down with your fingers so you get a nice seal and pressing those ingredients that really help the presentation value when you go to cut it so all your filling stays in those rolls give it one more press down next we're going to scoop out the flesh of the avocado using a spoon like I said you want a nice ripe avocado for this so you can form it up to the roll and then just make very thin slices to go on top I want you had that sliced up layer the slices on top of the roll this doesn't have to be perfect cuz once you go ahead and put the cellophane wrap and you press it down that I'll take away some of the blemishes you see here this is the messy part and it takes a little while it is a little bit of work but it's worth the time and effort when you see the end result and taste it so once you press that cellophane wrap and the avocados down using the sushi mat you'll see how the avocado really forms to the rolls using a wet serrated knife I cut the roll in half cut those in half and those in half again anytime you're cutting a roll you want to make sure you clean your knife in between cuts especially with cream cheese and avocado because it really has a tendency to stick to the knife and then the plated I use a rectangle white plate saran wrap should come out in one nice fail swoop and then I add a sweet eel sauce on top you can buy this prepared or you can cook it yourself it's pretty simple and then here you have the American dream roll I hope you enjoyed this video tutorial on how to make American style sushi rolls please rate and comment and enjoy the sushi ",

        "content": "so good morning good morning what are we gonna demonstrate today today we're just gonna do a little quick sushi sushi rolls reverse yes sushi rolls yes and those are and those are gonna be what vegetable sushi rolls yes because this is the way you taught me and I like this recipe i I love this recipe I think it works I think it's very tasty I mean everybody had open house loved it I mean they ate it right up super easy to make kids love it too yes did you see it did you see them snarking it down the other day Jesse there yeah so what's the deal with the sushi rolls we can put anything in it really right but today we're just gonna demonstrate the technique and a basic vegetable reverse sushi roll yep and that means that the rice is from the outside now I took your advice and I cut all my my nori into sheets right yep yeah they come when they sell them they usually come in and squares yeah that right all right we cut them in the middle yeah that's all we need yeah let's let's cut the the cucumber in the size of the nori so the strips are exactly the size of the room all right like yeah this is that quick go like this I'll just take a little bit of this off although I don't this does not bother me the green on this cute kind of cucumber doesn't bother me I kind of like the color yeah it doesn't bother me either usually I just do stripes when I yeah yeah when I'm putting it my salad or whatever I agree I agree okay let's see if I can do this from one end to the other nice and we really recommend getting one of these peelers that does be what I call it Julianne yes it's just someone makes it so much he's doing it you know yes unless you're like a master chef slicer Dicer yeah it's gonna be way easier beautifully julienned vegetables and we have our nori and we have the cream cheese we have free cheese which we are not going to overdo because I think that was what our problem was last time we did it yeah we had because we're using half of she here they don't they don't take a lot of material in them no but you want to be able to taste the flavor there is no doubt you know that you want to be able to give it give it a good flavor now what gives your theory on the shiny side and they're not shiny side I don't think there's a difference but I usually do the rice on the rougher side just because it's safer yeah and it sticks better yeah that's that's my that's not a bad theory I'm sure that there is some mystical story behind which side you use if you a real sushi master I know I'm gonna just get some water all right now this water is essential not to not have you know lumpy right hands right and this is some sushi rice that I've had for a little while so it's very sticky can you see it yep it's very sticky it's not the same one we made but ya know it's sticky but it's just fine for what we're gonna use it for today and we're gonna put a link there to the video on how to make this sushi rice and it's super easy and you know it comes out perfect every time yeah so I mean honestly in fact my daughter by the way I used to make over like regular rice or like curried rice and she now insists on this rice for some reason she really likes it do you think it's the seasoning of a vinegar and a seasoning I think's on the sugar and the salt and it's just it yeah I just taste good seasoned rice vinegar so we basically created a nice layer a bright enough I know I'm not as good as at it as you are it's that's good to know everything seems to work at the end so now this is the this is how we're gonna get the rice on the outside of the sushi roll flip it over turn it over okay and what we're gonna do is we're going to put our ingredients in here so we have a little bit of cream cheese and it doesn't you can if you want to use flavored cream cheese go for it I mean who far be it from me but honestly from for this recipe you've got so much flavoring in the nori you've got your Rice's flavors you've got your veggies I don't really think you flavor your cream cheese I don't think so either I think the cream cheese by itself has a lot of flavor you know what I did yesterday I put some cream cheese on pizza because I wanted to have it I wanted to see how it tastes on pizza and you know what it tasted wonderful it wasn't really yep actually I think of it's something I'm gonna add cheaper yep very interesting it was kind of melty and it tasted it really energies as well oh yeah yeah yeah I just put it like a few gulps of cream cheese and it basically just turned out nice so this is how we put the veggies on top of the cream cheese and you don't overstuff it just you know go latina well remember you're rolling up so you're getting that thickness by the time you roll this a couple of times you will so first things first you roll it over okay and then you roll it through out we did the first roll and then we rolled it throughout and this is how it came out and now all you need to do is what my sesame seed on it but the sesame seed right look at how professional this so you're funny looks awesome alright somebody's gonna have some so we've just got our sesame seed kind of on the whole thing there yay okay cutting time yep sharp knife sharp knife let's see if I have one maybe I do Oh look in the drawer all right this is not cheese why do have first sure and half the way I do it I usually wiggle it a little so it doesn't some more we go there we go I mean it's not it's not a knife isn't sharp is it as a sharp as it should be right you are correct we should have should have reached for the other knife anyway this is the concept and look look how nice they look like here a little bit so this is a really easy way to make sushi rolls head home and everybody seems to go crazy about them right right all right so what do you do after this or right now actually you give it a thumbs up thumbs up and subscribe and watch us in the next video yes all right let's eat ",

        "content": "we are with Chris Capel here at uma to mah Korea and today we're going to be learning about hand rolls so first of all what exactly is a hand roll that's what he is it's essentially sushi in a different shape you know it's still wrapped in nori it's still seasoned rice and fish and it's really it's really all the same ingredients that are in it it just gives you a little more accessibility and the option to sort of carry it and walk with it and and eat it on the go right and so for people who are a little scared of like making sushi at home or approaching sushi kind of in a DIY fashion is it okay absolutely I mean the key is understanding making rice and seasoning rice and getting that sort of portion of it right but this sort of eliminates a lot of the technical skill needed to make it in the sense that you know you can sort of train almost anybody to roll something into a cone really I mean almost any but not anybody but a whole state and you're gonna try to trade me so let's see if you can drain anyone talk about the fish because I think that's a piece of people go oh I can't buy raw fish yeah yeah what do you need to have sushi grade fish and what do people need to look for what you need is a relationship with your fishmonger and then the other thing is sort of understanding what the signs are to look for the keys aren't press the fish if it springs back it means it's usually in pretty good shape the odd check the eyes the eye should be clear you know once they start turning cloudy it means they've been dead and out of the water for a long time um gills source are trained Brown so if you lift up that little flap behind their eyes and lift it hills up they should be bright red a little discoloration might be okay but you really looking for something fresh and red it's means it's vibrant and alive and and that's those are the key points and so where do we begin if we're making at samake how do we like what we need what we get started with okay so that I mean the beginning traditionally is this which is the Hungary which is where the rice gets seasoned so the rice comes out of the cooker it gets put in here it gets sort of it gets fans down alright so you bring the temperature down to about 130 degrees or so because if you mix it when it's very hot it starts becoming very glutinous so cooling the rice down before you season it and then using a mixture of sugar and vinegar evenly mixing these things into it it's very very key you want to get the flavor profile out of it that acidity and that salt and the sugar really brings out the fish and the flavors so we have our race that you've already kindly made we two seasons yes alright so the first step is to take the paddle pick out the amount the amount of rice you're looking for that's a lot of rice that's a kind of rice we're not being stingy here absolutely and the rice is delicious so it's sort of like you you want to you want the rice you will start off with the summe tuna which is one of the signature chef rolls but this isn't a sunny ginger sauce so it's our take on the spicy tuna sort of roll so we have this obviously is like acidic and and hot smokin spicy and then we have the sweetness and the crunch from the apple what do you want to cover maybe are you getting in here this is the one that I have to do now it sounds that way it's just it came to you the key the key is you so you want to tuck your finger in yeah okay so hold it together and give it a cone-shaped roll do you like make sure that it sticks well you know that's all point is you keep it in your hands so that's it if you want to do you have your race you have your sushi pencil topping that's it yeah and one of the beauties of this is you have all these options so for choose your protein choose your sauce choose your vegetables multiple vegetables choose your toppings you think but I'm gonna say if I can make okay so we started there's a--there's important actually yeah so the shiny side should be on the outside okay so the inside help sort of the rice and hold the other things that you stick into it yeah looks so much prettier yes it's about it's about eating with your eyes first right so we're taking how do you know when you have the right amount it's about what you want and then do you press it down mm-hmm so sort of flatten it out as best you can so I'm gonna go okay overload it too much so it's for us we do about an ounce and a half little fish itself so it's usually where it's time to be about 4 to 5 slices so you sort of been there already maybe you want to stick one more down here so you get a little bite of it as a bottom too sad Justin said just rice because rice bottom okay oh my go and I'm kind of lying I don't go ahead and so again just a little bit like you don't want to overdo it yeah it's about balance okay apples seems like a good idea so now this is like the moment of truth so again you want to tuck that bottom right corner any other and hold yeah hold it in and pull I'm gonna pull this corner as far over as you can yeah and then when you hold here do you would keep your fingers here so you keep the stuff inside it so like tuck and roll okay like so you're on fire that's amazing all right mine doesn't look quite as pretty as yours but it's a wonderful tomato but it was easier than I thought it would be that makes me happy to hear and it's something a it's delicious B it's easy so you can be falling great for friends great for kids easy enough for if you don't wanna do yourself just come here well thank you so much for teaching us how to properly make a hand roll or its lucky as what was not really said really appreciate it my pleasure we're happy to have you ",

        "content": "today we're going to learn how to make Philadelphia rolls these are really cool so the first thing you're going to need we use smoked salmon some restaurants use raw salmon really it's all over the map but the smoked salmon in my opinion is excellent meat rolls so we took one of the pieces of the smoked salmon and really a little bit goes a long way and we went ahead and you see here when cut into strips now the next thing is used Philadelphia Cream Cheese of course you want to cut a piece off like so and then cut that piece into a couple little stripes because a little bit does go along there you go assume now so you can see them now that's that's what you're going for right there now the next ingredient is of course cucumber and we go ahead and we're going to show you how to cut it here sharp knife goes a long way you can simply put on the cucumber and drag it right through like so really sharp knife makes this really easy to do and we want to get consistent cuts here so just be sure to keep an eye out for that way you're cutting it up and we'll show you right now then we have three equally sized ones right there and right here this is about the size you're looking for to go inside of your roll now we use a specialty rice base rule for this one or all the specialty rolls use it if you're not sure how to do that click on the link and we show you how to do it in depth right there so we're taking the smoked salmon or legging across to make sure all different pieces and sushi get the same amount and we go ahead we're putting the cucumber right there as well and then we're taking the cream cheese and this roll is really cool I gotta say this is this is one of my favorites and it surprised me how much I liked it actually so now we're taking this and we're rolling it over and what the specialty sushi is watch out when you're filling them up because the temptation to load it fill up all the goodies on the inside is really high but then what happens is you can't roll it over all the way because it is smaller than your traditional rolls so just be careful when you're filling up your your sushi there we go we've gone ahead and rolled it over completely as you can see now we put on the cutting board the final touches here are to go ahead and add some tests I've tested some toasted sesame seeds and get a nice even coat all the way around it like so our housewives doing an excellent job making sure there you go [Music] now the next step is to cut it and you'll notice we're wiping our knife on a wet clean rag and that rag has been soaked in a rice vinegar and water mixture and what that does is when you wipe the knife on it it coats the knife that keeps the stickiness off of it and for those you've watched our rice videos you know that the water and rice vinegar mixture is what keeps the rice from sticking from your hands and when we wipe the knife on it it does the same thing for the knife so there you go you can see or cutting right through it and you want to make sure of course to get nice evenly sized pieces for when you serve it on the plate it looks nice and pretty like we all knows sushi should there we go cutting it right down to the end like so and the next step is to put it on your sushi beta or whatever plate you choose to display it on putting out right there please turned out really nice you can see here and we hope they were too much fun to make in your home as they were in ours so thank you for watching we appreciate likes and comments and please remember ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "see today we're going to learn how to make caterpillar rolls for all your vacatio lovers out there first thing we need is to crab sticks this is for the roll that we're making underneath the avocado and then in the roll as well there's going to be avocados in as well as on top of it so really the base of the caterpillar roll is a mini California roll and that's what we're making first so here with the crab sticks and then with the avocados slice like so and you can slice horizontally if you want for the avocado that goes inside of it but either way remember to put lemon juice on it because you certainly don't want your avocado to turn to brown before you serve the avocado so next we're going to take the cucumber that we already have cut to length and then we're going to cut it into strips so here we're just pulling the knife right down the side like so with especially with a sharp knife cucumbers are very very easy to cut in this fashion so you shouldn't have a problem with that at all and we're going to show you a piece real quick we're going to separate it out and as you can see those are the strip's you're looking for and in particular one that looks like this so once you have the ingredients if we're for the specialty rules we have a mini rice base that you see there and if you don't know how to make that please see the other video with the link up there we explain how to do that it's really simple but please see our how to video now what we're doing here is we're putting together basically our mini California roll to start with you can see we have the crab sticks the cucumber and the avocado and the next thing we do is we're going to go ahead and roll that up and with these mini rolls really you're lucky to get about one and a quarter roll out of it and as you can see here we got one and with the bigger role is usually you can roll it over two or three times with these many rolls you really got to keep it kind of tight and as you can see there that's about and we may have made it close to one and a half time by the firm gripping motion to make sure that everything is coming together on the inside not smashing it but turning into one piece mind you and there we go that's what it's gonna look like and we're gonna take it off our bamboo mat like so and the next thing we need to do is to slice up the other half of that avocado now for this one you do need to cut it in this fashion you can't cut it horizontally for what goes on top and as you can see here the key is consistently sized slices otherwise you get kind of a bumpy caterpillar roll and I know caterpillars are kind of bumpy in nature but usually in sushi you don't want it to look quite like that and once again the lemon juice is essential here especially because the avocado on top is going to be exposed a lot more than the avocado on the inside now we take the avocado pieces that we cut and what we're going to do is we're going to put it on top like so and as you can see some of acardo's are softer than others some are firmer it just depends on exactly where it is in the ripening stage this was just ripe enough to use and right now you can see we're kind of a hard time with it just sitting down on the sushi like we wanted to look like in the end product but don't worry we're going to show you how to do that just a second right now what's key is just to make sure that all of the avocado pieces kind of overlap and that they're all look the same in as far as like the placement so imagine a center line down the sushi and you're balancing all the pieces of the avocado on that center line so they all line up as best you can and probably right about there is enough you want to be sure to cut it from front to the end and the next thing we're going to do is we're going to take a piece of saran wrap and cover the sushi roll like so and kind of make sure it comes down on the edges and then what's the critical step is we take the bamboo mat and we actually squeeze just like so and we want to squeeze firmly enough to make the avocado will be one with the sushi roll underneath not enough to smash the avocado but enough to become one and what's gonna be critical when we cut the sushi up is you want to take a rag and dip it in the right and the water and rice vinegar mix that you had when you made the rice face that we explained in the other video we're gonna use this rag to wipe it make sure it's a clean rag certainly want a clean rag and what we're gonna do is we're gonna use it to wipe the knife between each of the cuts on our roll like so the reason for that is because it makes for nice clean cuts going through the saran wrap and the roll if you don't do that it makes it very very difficult to cut these and you end up getting mess on your hands so right there we're cutting about the width of the avocado pieces on top of the sushi roll we're wetting the knife and cutting right down through it like so and the saran wrap makes this really easy to do and really possible and that's about how many cuts we're going to do now the next step is to pull the saran wrap off like so as you can see the avocado stays like it should and what we do is we take off the pieces and we put it on our display we use a sushi Gator you're welcome to use or whatever you care to at home there we go just like so and there we have it caterpillar rolls and we hope you have as much fun making at home as we did these sure were delicious thanks for watching we appreciate like ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "welcome to cooking from the cave i'm chef pete jersey i can today we're going to be doing a sushi episode I'm going to show you three different roles spicy tuna vegetarian Maki roll and philadelphia roll so let's get started first roll we're going to do is the vegetable Maki roll this is the one where the seaweed is going to be on the outside few words about seaweed you're looking for the nori sheets you want to make sure when you're doing the sushi the rough side think of our for rough equals rice so we're going to make sure that smooth side is down we also want to have a bowl of salt water nearby not too salty but just enough and we're going to want to keep our hands moist throughout this entire process what I'll do is I'll dip a silicone brush in here and I'm just going to lightly brush my seaweed and I might go in between connet see we did annoy me but either one is either word is the same thing so keep that in mind while you're watching this and just keep those fingers what we're going to grab the sushi and the sushi should feel like we're making almost a snowball so it's going to be sticky and we're going to lay this out keep in mind your hands are going to go in and out of that water constantly throughout this process where latest down flat any excess moisture from your fingers that goes beyond the rice itself is going to just enhance and make rolling the sushi that much easier I'm going to do probably about two thirds of this nori roll soup seaweed and I'm going to cover with the rice so I'm only going to go about two-thirds up doesn't have to be perfect but get that side close to you filled and work your way up wash my hands in that water and then from here we're going to lay a thin layer of carrots then we're going to do a layer of cucumbers I'm going to try and keep this nice and tight so that when we look at it can have that nice beautiful I of the vegetables on the inside the next is the avocado I think the easiest thing with the avocados is to use that spoon trick that we show in a couple of our episodes maybe when we're making the guacamole and stuff I'm going to use a knife as well relay the avocado out and I'm looking for thinner pieces so this one's a little too thick so let's cut that guy down in half and from here it's really whatever else you want to put in that vegetable roll you know I'd see if you can put peppers in there as well some red onions I'm going to put some pickled ginger that I've pickled using some vinegar a little bit of sugar a little bit of water it's going to give a nice sweet enhancement to this role but at this point let's roll this guy up to two ways of doing this you can do it free form or you can use a map I prefer to use the sushi map but i will show you both ways in case you don't have one of these and i'll show you how to use this later on with doing some of our fish or shashimi once what we're going to do is we're going to get those fingers nice and wet and we're going to pull this role towards us now this again is the one without the map if you want to try making sushi maybe you don't want to go through all the hassle one locating one of these although they're readily available and we're just going to keep pulling that nori or seaweed towards us giving us a nice tight roll we're just going to keep pulling it keep rolling it keep pulling it and then what I do at the end is I'll just lay it out flat you know what it looks like oh that's beautiful so that's what we're looking at for our role now before I cut this I'm going to go ahead and put this in the refrigerator because I'm going to make some more seafood sushi or sashimi sushi and then we'll cut it all at the same time those alright so the next thing we're to do is the Philadelphia rule is going to have a cream cheese salmon and what we're going to roll it so it's on the outside so the rice going to be outside the first thing we're going to do again start with our know where I'm going to do this one on the mat the sushi rolling that i'm going to get my hands nice and wet in that water and we're going to press this down this writes down over the entire sheet of nori nori is covered in rice we're going to flip it over and get those fingers nice and wet I'm going to show you a trick with doing the cream cheese here I have one already rolled out but the way I do this is after I slice my brick of cream cheese into a wedge I'm going to sit there almost like it's played on i'm just going to roll it in my hands so I can get it almost the entire length is actually a little bit too thin but once it's going to be the length of my Nora push it to the front we're then going to load up our cucumbers and we can begin to slice our salmon for this again with the sushi it's all about the freshness so I'm on my refrigerator grab my piece of salmon when I ordered from the butcher or the fishmonger your seafood purveyor ask for sushi grade or sashimi grade fish next thing you're going to do is you're going to want to cut you're also going to want to make sure that you're going to get as much fat and this as possible believe it or not so we're going to cut this on the bias so it's going to be at an angle towards our board I'm right-handed so i actually have to flip the whole thing over so i get a good angle here and we want to cut it into nice thin pieces again as much fat as you possibly can and if you can you know find a sushi knife or sashimi knife just make sure your knife is as sharp as possible so you can get those nice very thin slices of salmon I've done this a few times before so it might be doing this a little faster than you you can at home but just take your time make sure you get nice even thin slices let's go on there and now we can be getting to roll it start at one end work our way over I always start without the mat and I'm going to make a nice tight seal there then I'm going to bring the mat over and with the mat I'm going to use the palm or the fat side of my hand here and I'm going to use that I'm going to hold on the mat with my left hand and I'm going to push everything towards me so I'm moving this hand towards my belly as I'm holding this mat in place looks good so far roll it again again grab that map with my left hand pull that sushi towards me again good to go we're going to continue to do this i chi a little bit and I'll move that sushi up a little bit closer to me I get a better grip on it we're going to roll it a little bit further and every time we do that we're going to pull the mat towards our belly what that will leave us with is a nice rice covered roll again I'm pulling it nice and hard left hand away there you go now the spicy tuna roll my favorite because I've loved eatin my food we're going to do this one a little bit different still going to be an inside-out rule so your rice is going to be on the outside yes it's going to have some heat to it but I'm going to do a nice big thick roll so i can show you the difference between that philadelphia roll and then the spicy tuna see you can kind of decide hey how do i want to make these roles i'm going to show you three different ways today from that vegetarian all the way to this one we're going to start it off just like we did with that philadelphia roll so the rice is going to be on the rough side so i'm going to start with the wet my hands and then layering on the rice alright so for this spicy tuna roll we're going to go thick around the rice and we're going to leave the top third open so that means I'm not going to cover with any rice kind of going back to that vegetarian roll we did same concept but flip it over now we're going to go ahead and fill the inside with what our spicy tuna feeling is going to be we're going to start off with some Japanese mayonnaise Japanese meetings just typical mayonnaise with a little bit sugar mixed in I'm going to add a little bit of prepared spicy mustard to this mixture in the bowl and then some oil some hot chili oil probably about a half a teaspoon we're and mix all that up and we first have to get our tuna cut chopped up just to show you what our spicy mayo looks like and I also add sriracha sauce for this I have about a teaspoon of it so it's nice and spicy if you don't like it that hot maybe don't make this role but this is definitely the way to go mincing up the tuna you're going to buy a sashimi grade tuna it's going to run you probably right around thirty dollars a pound don't freak out about that know that this is the best that you can get some people prefer the bloodline which is this red here gives a little bit more of an iron flavor I personally do not so I'm going to cut around that or I'm going to cut from the other side don't handle your fish too much but just cut it again into the same concept that I showed you with that salmon we want the little white lines in there that's the fat and this is going to be a min stroll so I'm going to go ahead and chop this up I'm going to try and cut it blue you're not as few of times as possible so after cutting it in one direction come back cut it in the next and yeah it's going to fall apart on you but that's why we're mincing it I'm going to do this until we get to a fine chop alright so let's add our chopped turn it to the spicy mayo mix we're going to make it a lot of rules tonight so I'll get my fish back in the refrigerator our next step is to mince up the scallions or green onions I'm going to go really really thin on this and really really fun you guys are going to get tossed in with the tuna as well stir this up rolling the spicy tuna roll i just want to point out make sure that you start with that space where that we didn't put any rice don't fill their fill on top of it so i'm going to go right above that line how do you want to put this in the sushi rice 22 right of the bowl we're going to put this roll it over almost like we're talking it in and now we can start to roll our sushi remember that rice is going to be really sticky so we can we want to move fast with this don't give it a lot of pressure we don't want the filling that moves out a little bit is going to happen there's nothing you can do about that from there give it one more nice tight finish it will put this guy right in the refrigerator I'll show you a little bit how to cut it and now I'm going to show you how to properly slice the sushi for the ones that have the nori on the outside you may want to do something on the bias get yourself a slicing knife or a carving knife if you will and I'm going to cut these on the bias so what they'll do is they'll present themselves beautifully on the plate you get a little bit of the care at some of the avocados and the cucumber in there and depending how many guests you have or how you know how you're serving this is this going to be for you know you the entire dinner or just just an appetizer you may want to cut you know maybe figure 4 to 6 pieces of sushi per person and I'm going to show you a different way now to cut these as well so I did one on the bias all right and then we're going to do you know a double 10 or a one and a half so it's has beautiful presentation on the plate for you like so also on this platter of sushi I got my philadelphia roll my spicy tuna roll I got some homemade wasabi use the wasabi powder make sure when you're shopping for wasabi you're looking for the pure wasabi powder otherwise a lot of times people just throw a horseradish in there and they'll dye it green so it looks like it's wasabi make your own if possible also our pickled gingers on there some vegetables next we're all I'm going to cut it too spicy tuna make sure you cut the one with the nori on the outside first it makes it for an easier cut later on but also the most important thing as regards to how you want to cutter or why you're cutting make sure you have a very sharp knife that's why I'd like to use the flexible slicer or carving knife again actually for this one you can do it one of two ways you can go straight down you can do it on the bias I like to let the knife do the work for me so I'm going to start it make sure I hear that it gets down to that nori and then from there I'm going to push the night forward drag the knife back and I have these beautiful putting them with the wrong rolls I'm gonna have these beautiful spicy tuna rolls all set for us and our dinner our three roles are done now what do we drink with this a co-worker of mine suggested hate skip the sake although that would be great go with this beer it says Sophie from a local brewery at goose island in Chicago here said it would go perfect with this so I'm going to dig into the beer dig into the sushi I can't wait thanks for joining us from cooking from the cave I'm chef Peter Zack will see a real soon ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "welcome back to the video now today I'm going to teach you how to make some sushi a futomaki sushi roll with a little thin sheet of daikon on the outside now what is the photo backing sushi roll well it's a slightly larger sushi roll but it's cut a bit thinner and the daikon sheet I'm going to teach you how to make it in this video but I've also made another video in the past where I teach how to make it a little bit easier with a simpler method you can check that out by clicking in the top right corner your screen well I'll leave a link in the description so you can check out after the video let's get straight to it let's go let's start by making some prep for the recipe for that I'm going to take a daikon radish and just cut it into a block and then I'm going to cut it into a thin sheet this technique is called capsular Mookie and I've made a video showing how to make this a very easy method and the links in the description this is also another great method where you just roll it on the cutting board and zig zag the knife up and down steadily as you push the radish into it once you've got a long enough sheet like this then you just want to cut it and fold it and reserve it for later we'll use that a bit now you take some asparagus and just cut the bottom half off and you just pop these into a cooking pot with some water and salt at 90 degrees Celsius and you just want to cook them for 45 seconds to 60 seconds really quickly just blanch them and out okay now moving on you're going to want to prepare your character for that you're gonna take a peeled carrot and just cut the sides off and then cut one working surface on one side and slice it into thin slices about one millimeter thick and there we go okay now to cut these you can either stack them on top of each other and then cut them or just the easier method is just lay them out flat like this on a cutting board and then just slowly and methodically cut them into thin strips so you have long sticks and care once you've got that done then just reserve this on the side for later okay great and now moving on to radish you're gonna take your radish and slice it into thin slices one millimeter thick as well and then you want to slice it again into one millimeter thick sticks there we go as many as you can and again just reserve these on the side later moving onto avvocato take an avocado slice in half around the pit like that then peel it and you want to cut this into wedges starting at one side angling the knife round and like that reserve this on the side and now moving on to the fish for that take a 200 gram loin of shimmy great salmon and now you're gonna want to slice it like this in half and once you've done that you're going to want to cut it into logs lengthwise like so each log will be about 25 grams and they'll look just about like this now reserve them on the side for later now moving on to your nori you're going to want to cut it in half and good seaweed nori paper should be crispy and easy to cut like this okay once you've done that place your rolling mat on a board and place it on top then where your hand in some water and vinegar take your hundred grams of cooked and seasoned sushi rice check out my recipe for sushi rice and the link in the description below now spread it onto your nori sheet leaving a little gap at the top just like this now take a little bit of wasabi and spread it across with your finger add two pieces of salmon two pieces of asparagus a little bit of carrot then some radish then some tobiko flying fish roe and one avocado slice then roll it forward and close it before the Wrights ends and then push forward to seal it okay once you've formed your footer Maki sushi roll you're going to want to wrap it in your daikon sheet so take your take on sheet and just place it on the cutting board and then place your roll on top and then roll it round until you've rolled once completely and then you're going to want to cut it at about 20 percent more and then continue rolling that once you've done that then you want to cut off the end like this and cut into for sushi roll bits dispose of the end pieces and then for presentation place one of them flat on the board like this and then lean the rest of the rolls against it like so beautiful presentation of your marvel futomaki sushi oh okay so there we go now you know how to make beautiful but delicious food Oh Maki sushi roll wrapped in daikon now this sushi roll was called the marbled diaphragmatic sushi roll because I asked my fans you guys what I should call it on Instagram and a bunch of you replied and I chose this name out of many many many suggestions now it was suggested by Tao marry me round okay I'm really sorry for butchering the last name but thank you for suggesting the winning name and the prize is absolutely nothing moving on if you want to suggest a sushi name in the future or you want to see some behind the scenes or

straight to the bottom no problem and here we're going to show you an example of how the slice should look and see we made a couple here but that's what you want now next we have an avocado that's been cut in half as well and the same thing you want to slice it lengthwise actually you could go a horizontal as well it really doesn't matter but for our purposes we're going to do it this way and you'll see with a nice sharp knife you can slice right through the avocado just like we did the cucumber and one thing we're going to show you it's a little trick as most of you know avocados tend to turn brown what we do after we slice ours is we add just a little bit of lemon juice to it make sure it keeps its color while it's inside of the sushi now the other ingredient you'll need is the crab sticks and what we do to make it a special California roll is that we slice up the crab sticks into really fine pieces and we're gonna mix it with mayonnaise as will display in just a second I've probably sounds like I'm repeating myself but there really is nothing like a sharp knife when you're making sushi it really really makes all the difference to make sure cuts really clean and nice and makes for making it just a lot more pleasurable experience and here for the crab we use the tataki method that you've probably seen in our spicy tuna roll method as well and really just taking the knife and cutting it as finely as you can it's real important please be sure to be careful when that I have certainly sliced my finger several times while doing this and our model is making it look a lot easier than now yours truly finds it to be so just go back forth over your pile of chopped crap stick to really get it into those fine pieces so it mixes up really well with the mayonnaise that we're going to show in just a moment and back and forth and back and forth and just keep doing that to get the consistency that you like we've made it a bunch of times for our model really knows exactly the consistency we like and it's pretty consistent with what you'll find in the recipes I'm sorry the recipe is I mean the sushi order in the restaurants and you know but each time we have some friends like bigger chunks we like the smaller chunks but hey it's each to their own so that's what you wanted to look like and to mix the mayonnaise you know there's a couple schools of thought we like Japanese mayonnaise when we use it just to dip vegetables in and things like that for us and for what we thought be good for demonstration purposes we use the regular mayonnaise you can find in the store but hey th to the room but essentially this too is whatever consistency you like before the two crab sakes we tend to use one heaping regular spoonful to mix in with it and with this too just like anything else you run and mix it really thoroughly to be sure to get the even consistency all across the board and so we know we keep mixing and that's what you wanted to look like now is the fun part and if you don't know how to make the base to do the Maki sushi or the roll sushi please see our other video we explained how to get it to this point really thoroughly so you can be sure not to make any mistakes and have it exactly how you want it but here we're putting the crab mix just a little bit off-center closer to the model and you'll we explain that the Maki sushi video why you want to do that it helps when you roll it so we take that crab and mayo mixture we just made we apply it evenly all the way across next we're going to do is we're going to take the cucumber slice and notice that the cucumber slice the same length as the makizushi and then we're gonna take those cucumber slices and lay them across like so that way every piece of sushi gets the cucumber crab and avocado mix now when we roll it you want to do it like so look I said it was off-center and you want to put a firm grip on there not enough to really smash everything inside of it but enough to make it definitely come together and form together in one piece and we roll it over again those are nice firm squeezing motions that we just saw again and then we keep doing that once again and this time it took us three times to do it and our models squeezing again nice firm grip and there we go that's what it looks like after it comes out of the roller now here what we want to add as well is the sesame seeds and you'll notice we put our hand there to keep them from flying all over the table even though it's kind of unavoidable we roll it over a little bit add some more to the other side and kind of rub it in just a touch and now the other side the same thing we added just enough to coat it a little bit and now when we cut this is really important because you really need a really really sharp knife now I know there's people who wonder well what's the difference making the rice on the stovetop or in the rice cooker you'll see here we're using rice today that we made on the stovetop and it tastes great don't get me wrong it really does the taste isn't so much of a difference but what really matters is when you cut your sushi you'll see here that it doesn't quite stick together exactly how you'd like now there's nothing wrong with the end product just it's not nearly as clean and pretty as it would be if we use rice cooker rice but that being said the taste is fantastic and you can still make great sushi with it don't get me wrong and here's our final product our special California rolls and take my word for it they tasted awesome for watching ",

        "content": "hello my friends today I'm going to be teaching you guys how to make sushi now this isn't exactly the traditional way or even the right way to make sushi but this is what I do every time and I find every time it turns out very well and it tastes very good and for all of you at home who just want to learn how to make sushi a very simple way and not have to go to a sushi bar or a store and pick up very little sushi for a lot of money that doesn't even fill you up this is how to make sushi yourself and as much as you want for not as much as they're charging a store believe me so let's go to the kitchen and see what's cooking okay so here we are in the kitchen and I have all the ingredients laid out as such and the first thing you're going to need of course is rice and a rice cooker but if you don't have a rice cooker you can always just boil water and make some rice in there but nothing beats having a rice cooker I have three myself and I find the smallest one of the law to actually works the best it was only twenty bucks so if you don't have one and you plan on making sushi a lot you should definitely go out and just buy a rice cooker because they're very good and what I've done to this rice is to put a little bit of rice vinegar in it and what this does is it just gives it that little bit of a tangy taste that the sushi has they also have here a powdered rice vinegar and what that does is the same thing but it doesn't make the rice as sticky as the liquid version I do like to use the liquid version however because it does make the rice stick a little bit better to the sheet of seaweed and how you get a way from the knife sticking when the rice becomes too sticky is all you have to do is to get a little cup and you just dip the knife in that and maybe put a little bit of oil in the cup and that will make the knife much easier to go through Bryce when you're trying to cut it and all the ingredients now the ingredients I have laid out tonight you can use all sorts of different ingredients but what I'm going to use today is green onions and also what we have is a pickled radish notice you're going to have some trouble finding unless you go to a world market someplace that sells japanese asian things and also the meat i have here is just some salmon you could get at walmart or any sort of place like that and the reason i'm using this it's just because it's cheaper than buying a whole fish and cutting it out and for purposes of today it worked perfectly and you can also even use imitation crab which is even cheaper so let's get started the first thing you want to do is to cut all the ingredients I don't like to use the head of the great onion just because it gives it too much of an onion taste but some people might like that but I only like to use the soft i think i'm going to show you is the pickled radish which is probably one of the hardest thing to cut just because it has a shape that's not conducive for cutting but it in the end doesn't end up being too much of a problem now of course now we need to spread the rice on the to a seaweed and the rice becomes the most intricate part of this process just because it put too much then the role probably isn't going to close and if you don't put enough then your rice will be overpowered by the amount of ingredients you have and once you're finished with this it's going a little little something like a bit and you want to keep a little bit of an open space on one of the edges right here because that's where your ingredients are going to end up going and what we're going to do now is just to put the ingredients on there now go over here and get the salmon the one throw your ingredients are on there you might want to use a little more than this you can use really any kind of vegetables you want the vegetables complement sushi very well so once you put all these on here all you gotta do is roll it up very slowly so that it is even kind of like rolling a sleeping bag if you've ever done that just keep packing the edges in and because of the liquid vinegar I've used it is very sticky silk it does end up stain very well which actually becomes a problem in our next step which is to cut the sushi roll if you want to serve the sushi at a party or anything like that then you're going to cut it so it can be sort of hors d'oeuvre by putting this oil on to this night that makes it much easier to cut through all of this rice and if you don't do that it definitely tends to stick on there and of course if you're just doing this at home and you just want some sushi to eat then you don't have to worry about cutting this or nearly any of the aesthetic appeal but as we are right now it's all in the presentation so this is what your sushi ends up looking like and I hope now you have a better grasp on how to make very good sushi in a very simple way ",

        "content": "welcome back to another how to make sushi video tutorial today I'm going to show you how to make the salmon paradise sushi roll basically it's a salmon sushi roll with cucumber and carrot inside wrapped in spinach and topped with a beautiful sort of exposition on top that just makes it stand out from the rest now it's a little bit of work to make but boy is it beautiful and tasty so I hope you enjoy this recipe let's get straight to it let's go okay first things first you're gonna need some long leaf spinach just like this you're gonna want to have nice flat big leaves with a little stem to hold on to you're gonna want to take these and place them into boiling water so just pull up to them with a stem and just put them in there they don't need to cook long 20 seconds maximum reading boy once slipping with it you catch it back there and once it's done you're gonna want to place it into ice-cold water so they can cool down and stop the cooking process leave that to rest for a bit and once that's done you're gonna want to take a tea towel and just dry them out to spread them out evenly across the teeth out just like this and then just fold it up and put that away for later okay moving on carrots you're gonna want to take a big carrot and it's time to just peel this thing very simple those are we need instructions and once that's done just cut the top off and cut a little block off and you're gonna want to cut this into thin strips so here cut a working surface and then slice it into thin slices just like this and then you're gonna want to juvey on this so that just means cut it in strips that you're gonna chop it just like this okay once you've done that you're gonna do the same with a cucumber and for the cucumber I'm just gonna peel it in a different way I'm gonna use cut cold capsular Mookie in Japanese which is a turning cut okay I'm just peeling the skin off using the turning cut there we go and now I'm gonna cut the entire thing into a very very thin sheet so yeah I'm just rolling it across the surface while I slowly move the knife up and down to do this I've done this is a different video you can check it out I'll link in description now here I'm just gonna fold it up and I'm gonna slice it into thin slices again just like the character pull very simple to do there we go now moving on Sal give us a shimmy great Salman you're gonna want to cut it against the grain so I long like this you're gonna want to cut it into a slice about 1.5 centimeters stick a nice take portion and here on your slices again in half goes to two white and there we go got nice low this is 1.5 centimeters on one boy I said that's about three quarters of an inch and here I'm taking half a sheet of nori I'm gonna place 90 grams of cooked food seasoned sushi rice nice and evenly across it recipe in description this video I'm gonna place a little bit of fresh wasabi juice over like this with my finger thank you salmon on it and then add my sliced cucumber here with a little bit of sliced carrot on top of that now keep it nice and tight close to the salad and then you're going to want to roll it just curve it over and close it before the end of the nori and then you want to unwrap and roll forwards and then close it for you and then just rock roll around one more time and just press on it there we go and that's your sushi roll done now you're going to want to spread out your spinach into a nice sheet to cover your sushi roll so please take your sushi roll and just map out more or less way you're going to need to put the spinach and for that you're going to take the stems off the spinach and you're going to use the leafy pot and spread it out as much as you can and then you just want to place them over it like this and just layer them one over the other until you cover the area that you think we need okay now you take your roll and just roll it round in your spinach very simple just make sure the press insert stays nice and pressed onto your sushi I should stick on to if there's a space should be still slightly down even though you drive it now I'm just going to cut off the end so it it's nice and beautiful so here I'm just going to slice this side off and do the same to the other side now to cut your sushi roll you're going to cut it into half first so take you a very sharp knife and slice in half and then slice that into quarters and the quarters and eighths then between each cut I'm cleaning the knife to make sure that it gets nice and clean cuts here we go that's a beautiful sushi roll wrapped in finish and you're gonna want to take an avocado and slice it into three thin slices and then make a little triangle cut and place these little triangles on top of your sushi roll just like this and fan them out so they look beautiful now add a little drop of kelpy mayonnaise and you're gonna take some viola edible flowers and just pick two petals just like this there we go and you're gonna want to cut these in half more than that and you're gonna take these and place them right next to your mayonnaise just like this and then place the other one right next another beautiful now you're gonna take a little Salman room space out right next to the mayonnaise and then take a little piece of chive and cut it about two centimeters and paste that right next to the house and then add a couple of little sprinkles of toasted sesame seeds and there you go do that to the rest of sushi rolls and you've got just a very beautiful presentation of spinach coming to Salman sushi so there we go now you know how to make the salmon paradise sushi roll I hope you enjoyed it I hope you give it a try at home now if you do give it a try at home you're gonna need a couple things in the description of this video I've left a couple extra links to my sushi rice recipe or another video about in showing you how to do the castle movie cut turn and cut of the cucumber in more detail and also some other

        "content": "in this video I'm going to show you how to make the avocado and mango sushi roll this is a delicious sushi roll where you have crispy salmon glazed in mango juice and slices of paprika then covered with avocado and mango slices in sequence to make just an astonishingly beautiful sushi roll to fry the salmon add a little bit of coconut oil this is a great oil to cook with it's much more healthy than standard oils like olive oil or vegetable oil this is extremely good for you spread the coconut oil around a little bit alright so just add some offcuts of Salman doesn't need to be great power and what you're looking for is to crisp it up make nice crispy salmon that's great just turn over now just break up the common opinion there we go now you add about half cup of mango juice now this is freshly juiced mango and a little bit of honey there we go and just you want to get all the vapors out and slowly the mangoes juice and honey will stop sticking and coat your salmon in a beautiful glaze just keep stirring it around to make sure the sources stick to the bottom of the pan when it starts to lump together that's a really nice sticky layer of sauce and all the concentrated mango flavor is now coating the salmon that's what you really want begin by spreading out five ounces or 150 grams of cooked sushi rice over half a sheet of nori now you want to just spread it out nice and softly and just get a nice even coverage over the sheet with rice get a nice even coverage about teaspoon should do now you want to flip over the rice mat with the nori and place it on a bamboo sushi rolling mat with a plastic bag on it now place a little bit of red peppers a couple slices and then the prepared crispy mango glazed salmon which you just cooked earlier now you've placed the filling of the sushi roll onto it what you do is you bring over the top of the mat and you curl it in and you hold it in with your fingers while you just enclose now here the nori meets the nori and then you simply just move it over and there you go you seal the roll just apply some pressure and then just roll it forward again and apply some more pressure and voila a sushi bar okay now for the topping place thin slices of avocado and mango on top now these were both cut with a cheese knife you can slice it with a knife also but it's so much more easier with cheese knife now just place them on top avocados and mango avocado the mango and etc now I'm placing to avocado and one of mango because the avocado slices were quite small so it just doesn't seem right otherwise we want to get overlap about halfway down the roll this way later you'll be able to cut it off and it'll be a very neat avocado mango pattern okay so once you finish the overlay pattern what you want to do is place some cling film over it and compress the avocado and mango pattern onto it and I'll take the cling film off and what we're going to do for aesthetics is cut the mango and avocado so it has an even straight line they might need to hold some down and then you simply just separate okay there we go and now you have a straight edge line all the way across with avocado and mango okay do the same for the other side that makes the row just that much more beautiful there we go and now you put the cling film back on repress it on for the cutting now to cut it as always just I like to cut the end pieces off and this way you have nice rolls of sushi and you just start at one side and finish the other side this is the simple way for me mostly chefs what they like to do is they have the roll then they put the half next to each other and then make quarters and then eighths but I don't like to that like take time to individually cut every piece and this way that cut the perfection and there is no destruction okay there we go so now you just carefully clear it off this is to throw away and these are the beautiful rolls there we go that's how you make the avocado and mango sushi last week's voting with what sushi roll I would make this week ended up in a tie with three for how to make the avocado mango sushi roll and and three for how to roll sushi so I decided I'm going to make the avocado mango roll this week and the how to roll sushi video of next week and as a result there is no voting this week now if you guys want to vote the next time make a more decisive vote instead of even ",

        "content": "thanks for joining us that Japan food channel today we're gonna learn how to make creamy crunch rolls and these are really cool they just look awesome on the plate and they taste great which is always nice as well so the first thing we do is we have our salad mix there and it's crab salad made with real crab so it probably looks a little bit different than you're used to you can make with crab sticks as well if you feel so inclined we use real crap sometimes to spoil ourselves and we also have avocado then we put across here like so and the avocado sometimes sticks together that's okay it happens and another thing as well as we also use cream cheese and that's why we call it the creamy you know the creamy comes from the name out of this because of a creamy crab salad the avocado and the cream cheese and it just tastes awesome so what we're gonna do is go ahead and roll up and over like so squeeze firmly and this one's a little tricky because there's a lot of kind of you know creamy stuff in there so let me squeeze too hard a lot of it can just shake out the sides you don't want that to happen but you want to squeeze firm enough so it becomes one unit roll it up over and around like so and there you go that's what you wanted to look like at this point and the next thing you want to do is you want to get those little tempura bits that we teach how to make and you go ahead and you just spread them across the top like so you know there's really no way to make it perfect but just a nice line across the top and if some falls to the side here and there don't worry about it that's okay now the next thing we do is we get a piece of saran wrap if we put it on top push down and use our bamboo mat to kind of squeeze it once again make sure it's nice and firm and come together on the inside and plus those tempura bits stay on the top and then we get our knife we wipe it on the wet rag that has rice vinegar on it and we start by slicing in the middle and then working our ways to the side like so in between every cut you want to go ahead and wipe it on the rag because that's real important to make sure things don't stick to your knife just take it slice it and keep working your way to the outside like so and once you get there the next step is to go ahead and put it on her serving plate and you garnish it with little wasabi and pickled ginger and on top of it you put a little bit of unagi sauce that is nice and sweet and this is it they look great they taste wonderful this is a must make at home thank you for watching we appreciate like some comments please remember to subscribe ",

        "content": "now the first thing you needed is a piece of sushi grade fatty tuna and when you go to the meat market be sure to ask for sushi grade seafood that's really important if you don't get that you can really risk making yourself or someone else sick so be sure to double-check with the butcher behind the counter if it is sushi great now our lovely model here is slicing it nice and thin right from the start using our sashimi Hojo and sashimi means basically raw fish and Hojo is the Japanese word for knife that really does make all the difference in the world having a nice sharp knife to work with especially when you're working with excellent cuts of fish like we have today so we slice horizontally or I'm sorry Klee and now we're going back over and trying to get really really small tiny pieces we're going for not quite ground with the hamburger consistency here because there's you know for those of you fans out there from spicy tuna rolls like myself you know we get the really small pieces of fish mixed up with the spicy tuna sauce so that's what we're doing right now is is getting our sashimi grade or sushi grade piece of fish to those little chunks to mix it with the spicy tuna sauce now the Japanese technique here is called tataki and that's what you're witnessing right now I guess chopped is a pretty close translation in English for that it certainly is a little bit different technique but very similar nonetheless and for those of you really interested in Japanese culture and things like that you'll notice that on the hotel our knife if you will there are some engravings on the side and this knife is from Seki and that's where they originally made all of the ninja swords and right now that's a major hub for Japanese cutley as well me and my family visited there that's where they make some very fine surgical knives as well and actually feather brand who makes shaving themes for men his base are as well some excellent knives anything with a blade that comes out of that city is just ridiculously sharp and that's the knife that we're using today as well and I can't stress enough they're having a nice sharp knife working with these kinds of meats really makes all the difference in the world and picture's worth a thousand words so my has been demonstrating the tataki method here certainly be careful with your fingers you don't want to cut yourself and just going back and forth over the meat like so to get it to the almost hamburger consistency is what we're aiming for and I think we're getting pretty close you know just going back and forth back and forth over the meat is really what you need to do so there we are really bunching it together and there we go probably one more pass possibly to to get us there and there we go you see took a couple minutes but that's the consistency you want now that we know that we're at that point one mix in our spicy tuna sauce if you don't know how to make this sauce please see how their video we explained exactly how to mix it together for you guys out there now it gets a little trick you'll notice my is kind of slicing the meat with the spoon to mix in the spicy tuna sauce when you get the meat in this consistency it's not exactly the easiest to mix in sauces with but you just kind of rub it together and mix it around it it does take couple minutes but definitely you want to be gentle with your meat at this point even though we've just chopped it up really really small pieces but you know you don't want to mash it anymore so just be gentle with it mixed around it might take a couple minutes but you can certainly get it to where you want it to be and there's no hard and fast rules on your ratios here it's whatever flavor you want that's how much of the spicy tuna sauce you mix it whatever you think meet your spiciness taste now we also have the avocado slices that we're gonna include well so here we have an avocado that we've already sliced in half and here you can just see with the sharp knife going through the avocado like butter it really is a pleasure to cut with those sharp knives so we were making consistent thin slices from the avocado if you want to slice horizontally instead of vertically that's fine too it really is just personal preference at that point and after we sliced our avocado we want to be sure to add a little bit of lemon on top we don't want our avocados turning brown in the middle of our sushi roll even though it tastes fine it really does get to be rather unappetizing now we're gonna put it on our Maki sushi base if you don't know how to make the base here with the rice in the seaweed please see our Maki sushi video we explain how to do that in depth and really walk you through that process so what we're doing is we're adding the spicy tuna mixture it's hard to tell from the camera angle but it is slightly closer to the chef or our model if you will and you want to extend it all the way to the edges that's really important you don't want to have the orphan sushi pieces on the end that don't have any fish in them so definitely extend it a little bit past the nori or seaweed if you will and that's really really important so after we do that we want to get our avocado slices and they do have the habit of sticking together on the plate what we found after making the videos that really helps is to add some lemon juice between the slices and also on the plate below that helps them slide right off the plate so you'll see how my is adding the avocado slices are slightly lit an angle you don't need to go perfectly horizontal and that's where you want it that's what you want to look like before we go ahead and roll the pieces together now you've grabbed the bamboo mat lift it over enough for it to touch the other side of the sushi and with a firm gripping motion that's how we really get the sushi to come together now you don't want to smash it together you do want to be firm but I definitely don't want to just mash all the gradients in the middle together it really is a fine line that comes over time a little bit of practice and I'm sure you can get it down so we flipped it over again with the firm gripping motion once again and the saran wrap sometimes sticks together but it's not a problem at all and there we go the last round squeeze it a little bit more you'll see some of the spicy tuna coming out the sides if you squeeze it so hard that all of it pops out you definitely know you're gripping too hard but if it does come out just a little bit like so that's perfectly normal and that's what you wanted to look like right there so the next step is to add a little bit of the sesame seeds on the side roasted sesame seeds that is and you'll notice we put it on top enough to coat lightly and Pat it in just to touch now next we put on a cutting board and this is really where the sharp knife pays off incredible dividends you'll notice Sarah it's slicing right through and for those of you who do watch some of our videos I want to point out here that we use the rice cooker for the rice that we used on the spicy roll tuna here and you'll notice that it doesn't clump up as bad when you cut through you'll notice it you get nice clean slices the flavor of the stove type rice comes out the same but with the rice cooker you can see that's where you really get these neat cuts that you can really tell when you're cutting your sushi rolls in particular so here we are you know how thick you want your rolls and things like that is really just up to personal preference it's whatever you like I think we're cutting them a little bit thinner here but that's because we have a family and we all like to have a lot of pieces a lot of different flavored sushi so when you cut it that's what it'll look like and the next step is to put it on the plate for display we use the sushi Gaeta if you want to put on regular plate from your kitchen that's perfectly fine usually it's served with its own wasabi and ginger as we have as well but you take out the pieces for display and there you go there's your spicy tuna roll and we hope they turn out as wonderful in your kitchen as they did arms these tasted fabulous so thanks for watching we appreciate lisen comments and please remember ",

        "original_title": "HOMEMADE SUSHI ROLLS + SUSHI SAUCE RECIPE",
        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "everyone so this video is my recipe on sushi I have a massive sushi addict and if you follow me on instagram you will already know that I'll have my Instagram details down below and you will realize how much I eat sushi if you go through my photos so this recipe is used very often by me usually I buy my sushi out but if it's like late and I have a sushi craving I definitely make my own and I always have sushi ingredients in the house so first thing is that I'm not a sushi professional I don't know if this recipe is exactly correct it's just sort of how I do it and how I think to taste good ok so as for ingredients the first thing that you're going to meet is some rice you can really use any sort of rice that you want but I like to do sushi rice unfortunately I run out of sushi rice oh this is um but something rice or something like that but any rice will do it's the mirror that helps it stick and rice tastes the same to me so I don't really mind the second thing you're going to need that is crucial is seaweed you need this to wrap up your sushi roll of course and I just like this one because I find that it tastes the least fishy and I just like roll fish sushi I prefer you know that the vegetarian sushis and everything so I actually don't like the taste of fish so that's actually really nice and I love that one I definitely recommend it thing you're going to meet is Meir and it actually helps to stick your rice together which you'll see in a minute and I love this one this is the QP one it's the one with that little I'm not sure if you can see it but it's got that little guy on it like that little baby guy that sounds really weird but yeah it's the one that is like proper proper for sushi and everything and I love the taste of this it's delicious it just has like a thousand million calories and every single little spoonful but that's okay the next ingredient is whatever feelings that you want to put inside your sushi roll so for me I want to make avocado sushi so I have ever color half of this when tall it's my lunch so that's why that's missing but I'm probably going to be using I don't think I'll be using too much probably only this because I'm really going to be making one sushi roll so yeah just any feelings that you like then later on when we're making the sauce what we're going to need is your mayor again so you don't need two bottles just one but that's for the sauce and then also the kicker men sweet soy sauce really any soy sauce I just prefer this sweet one you can use normal soy sauce that's perfectly fine I just really really like this sweet one called the sauce and I find that it tastes a bit better but of course if you don't like that use whatever soy sauce you do like and then also it was savvy so any wasabi you want this is just one that I'm trying out I don't love this one but it's alright I'm a big fan of wasabi because I like horseradish and horseradish is what makes up wasabi but I actually don't really like this one it still works I'm not eating it by itself so it's been mixed in with things so yeah it's just any wasabi that you have or that you can purchase at your supermarket the other utensil that you're definitely going to meet is this little handy roller thing and this helps to roll up your sushi rolls so you definitely need one of these I think like I probably couldn't do without one but you can try and pretty sure you can purchase these from any supermarket or like an Asian grocery store that's where I get all my Asian foods from and then just chop sticks to your sushi with afterwards so I'm pretty sure that's everything and I'm going to get on to the recipe now so firstly you're going to want to take your rice and I've added mayonnaise to this so that just helps it kind of stick to the seaweed and then I'm going to take my little Rolly thing I'm not sure if that's exactly what it's called but I'm sure it's not called a roller thing and it's kind of dirty because I just made one I wanted to make sure that I would would still be able to make one because I have this in ages and then you're going to want to take your piece of seaweed and you'll notice that there's a smooth side and a rough textured side so we want to place a textured side up and that just kind of helps to stick it all together when rolling and then we're going to place some rice onto the sushi um seaweed and then just spread this evenly so now we're going to be taking our filling and since I'm using avocado I'm just going to be slicing up the pieces that I'm going to be using but you can use anything you want like chicken meat like everything really whatever you like on your sushi roll so then I'm just going to be placing it sort of off-center placing all the fillings off-center and just making a line like this and then I'm going to be doing a line next to it of mayonnaise probably not good for me but delicious and then what you've got to do is just start rolling so I recommend you kind of it's hard to explain so it might just be easier to watch so you just kind of push it in and then roll it again and push it in and make sure it's sticking and then roll it again to the end and then just roll it and help it stick and then you have got your sushi roll so then you're just going to want to cut it up okay so now I suggest taking a sharp knife and that's because the seaweed can be a little tricky to cut and then I'm going to be cutting this probably into five so trying to aim for even pieces so now that we have finished our sushi rolls the a we are going to be moving on to this sauce so you're going to need a bowl your sweet soy sauce your mayonnaise as well as you'll wasabi that's what it's called okay sorry I'm going to start off with the mayonnaise and add a little bit of that and then you're going to want it to be majority sauce so add probably two parts of what you just put that and then time to add your wasabi so this is actually depending on how hot you like your sources I prefer mine to be pretty spicy so I'm going to put a fair amount in okay so then you're just going to want to mix it together okay so now that the sauce has been all mixed together I'm going to take my little sushi balls and I already have ginger in this one and then you can take these off once you get to your table wherever you're running and you can use this plate to help your sushi on so like put it on here and then dip your sauces or whatever whatever you want to do but I definitely love this sauce and recommend trying it if you're a really big sushi fan and it kind of saves you from separately putting on all the components like wasabi mayonnaise and soy sauce because it's only one so this is the finished result of homemade sushi these kind of look really really funny but you can be a lot neater with them these are kind of a fail but you get the gist of it my recipe and then just the sauce and ginger and then all you need are your chopsticks and you are ready to eat so that is my homemade sushi recipe I hope you all enjoy please tell me if you make this and thank you so much for watching I'll see you in my next year bye ",

        "original_title": "Rainbow Sushi Roll Recipe",
        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "welcome back to another cooking video recipe I'm chef Devaux and I'm going to show you guys how to make the rainbow sushi roll we're going to do it from start to finish we were to start with doing boiling the shrimp getting all that ready and then doing such shimmy and then assembling sushi roll and then finish off with chopping up the sushi roll so I hope you guys enjoy this video let's get [Music] right so full of prawns what you want to do is you want to stick them inside a vacuum bag vacuum seal them and then put them inside a sous-vide machine at 58 degrees Celsius and this will cook them in about 12 minutes to just Park upon them if you don't have a sous-vide machine you can do it the old-fashioned way and if you want a video a tutorial how to do that you can check out my other video about how to make shrimp nigiri sushi or linkages fill up the corner alright so now you want to remove the head off your shrimp and then go to the back and pull off the scales and you can do this in one move what you do to do that is just go to the back and you push your thumb against it and you peel them all off one go now what you want to do is one little cut to make this side nice and straight then hold your shrimp down and place your knife right across it and just cut softly into it and make sure you cut just so you feel a pop and then you stop cutting now just go back in again and just make sure that it goes through so you can see the crew sock and you want to make sure you don't cut into that and you take it out in one piece otherwise you'll make your food taste very bad so move in one piece I saw small butterfly trim done okay now to see me some of the fishes I'm going to use to make the rainbow sushi roll what I've got here is yellowtail some yellowfin tuna and some Atlantic salmon all from Kazari doctor at UK is sponsoring me now and selling me fish like this frozen that's the same sort of tuna and basically just comes frozen packages you defrost it and it's ready to go awesome company go check it up all right so let's start with some salmon and now you notice I've already wrote 45-degree cut on to this if you don't have that then start by doing that to your sound and then you just bring your knife against it and rest your palm your fingers against the sound and then you just drag it through okay now you pull away and then you slice the bottom off and that's your slightest sound clean your border between fishes all right now the yellowtail I'll just take a knife again and slice it there's a couple slides will do for roll [Music] alright now let's do some tuna alright so for the tuna again you clean down your board and your knife before you start and they just basically simply slice through the tuna so you slice through one direction you peel back and you slice forward to cut just to make sure you've got the entire cut down okay so now to roll the rainbow Swiss roll it helps have big wooden board like this on if you want to say wooden boards this one you can click on link on the top left corner now and I'll take it to my website where you can find the same way it's pretty cheap and really big okay so now to spread your sushi rice over your nori you simply take your sushi rice lay it at the top of your roll and then just simply drag it across with your fingers it's quite effortlessly and you just want to spread it out so there's a nice even layer across the entire sheet and once you've done that you just flip it over and then you start cutting it first thing you want to add is some crab legs now this crab mix was made with mayonnaise imitation crab and some masago fish eggs once you've added the crab mix you just add a couple pieces of cucumber which I've sliced and now you start the rolling all right so now just pull up the back hold in with your fingers and pull over then you press in with your fingers and form it don't press too hard and move it forward then you press again and you release and this should be usable okay so now to decorate the top of your rainbow sushi roll we will start by adding a little piece of yellowtail then I'm going to add a slice of Accardo then a slice of tuna then a slice of south then another piece of avocado I like to put two pieces of fish avocado two piece of fish avocado all right so now a nice piece of butterflied shrimp of course and then we start again with yellowtail avocado and now a piece of tuna of course and a slice of sound [Music] and then finish it off with a piece of Mikado all right so now you finish your rainbow roll you just put a piece of cling film over it then press that down with another bamboo rolling mat perfect now what I like to do now is just take the pin come back off again and then just do a slice with a knife just to make it slightly more neat and have all the fish and the same spot [Music] don't worry well this can go straight to the chef's lunch don't worry about it it's not wasting anything I'm have to eat the adult pieces do the same to the other side and then put the cling film back on again [Music] so now to cut it just dip your blade in some water and just let the water drip down off it should the blade slightly weapon there's not as much resistance now I like to do here just cut off the end profit and the other end and then you cut in the middle and then cut the halves into quarters and now you cut the quarters into eighths perfect now what you want to do is just firm it up again with the bamboo rolling mat keep everything in place and then you just take it off now these little end pieces all right and this will you end with a beautiful sushi roll known as a rainbow sushi roll all right so now the plate up as you do use a little bit of soy sauce and now to finish it off you add some fresh real what's up [Music] you [Music] perfect [Music] hey I hope you enjoyed this video and if you did you might want to subscribe to my channel it's completely free so right now I click on

        "content": "hi everyone I'm just doing a real quick impromptu live broadcast tonight I wanted to show you how I make my super super simple sushi rolls at home and for those of you that aren't crazy about preparing food raw at home I'm going to show you how to do it with some steamed shrimp and avocado what you'll want to do is want to turn that down from in more more MORE okay thank you what you're gonna want to do is cook your sushi rice to package instructions and add your seasoned rice vinegar to make a sticky rice and then I took some shrimp and steamed it in some organic vegetable broth until it was cooked and later I will show you how to peel them I always like to buy them with the skin still on or shell still on because it's either cheaper or just seems less processed to me and then I also sliced some avocados and squeeze some lime juice on them so they don't turn brown and you're also going to need some sushi sushi nori which is the dried seaweed wrappers and we're going to be using a bamboo mat for rolling it so let's get started first I want to peel my shrimp and if you've had peel-and-eat shrimp before in a restaurant you certainly know how to do this already but you want to take everything including the tail off if you're making cook sushi at home you could do all sorts of different flavors sometimes I do sometimes I do teriyaki salmon and really thinly sliced cucumber for texture we've also done oh gosh what else have we done we've even done guacamole and a garlic shrimp inside yes and one time Marlin even we followed a facebook video and found a sushi recipe that had flaming hot cheetos inside and although it wasn't my favorite flavor for sushi it did add a great crunch and Marlon thought they were great okay so that's enough for us to get started here what I'm gonna do is cut them right down the center so they're a little flatter for inside our rolls then they're about the same thickness as my sliced avocado I think it was easier to go from this side we've been making sushi at home for a couple of years now still like to go to sushi restaurants especially for the raw food sometimes I prefer to have someone professional preparing it although I have found an amazing fish store our fish market here locally that serves that sells ahi tuna from Hawaii and they fly it in overnight every day so that's pretty amazing Marlin and I have even done a little trick where we'll close our eyes and bring the fish closer to each other's nose and say okay when you smell it when you know I'm close let me know when you smell it and it gets so close to us that you can actually touch your nose and still not smell it it's that fresh I think that's just absolutely amazing so anyways we've got all of our ingredients ready now and so I'm going to get started with my first sushi roll so you're gonna lay the mat out add one of our sushi wrappers our seaweed wrappers and then to get the rice on there it's really helpful to have a little ball of water so that your hands are wet it keeps the rice from sticking to your fingers as you're putting it down on the roll you can use a spoon or one of those bamboo little paddles that comes in a kit if you buy your bamboo mat within a kit it often comes with that a little paddle okay that's pretty good so now I'll put in some avocado and shrimp get my hands a quick quick rinse okay and then we're going to take this and wrap it around if you want to start rolling and make sure that you get your seaweed at least over the filling inside so we're going to start by pushing there and then you might give it a little press down you know I'm not claiming to be a sushi chef but I just think this is a great way to make an interesting meal at home that is really not very difficult at all try that again and you just want to keep rolling and pressing you want to put the seam side down for cutting okay so you've got this you start by cutting in the center and then we'll cut slices from there you'd serve this with some soy sauce with some wasabi pickled ginger chopsticks even a side salad if you felt like it and that's how quick and easy it is to make homemade sushi rolls at home hope you enjoyed it if you have any questions by all means feel free to ask and I will talk to you later bye ",

        "content": "today we're going to learn how to make shrimp tempura rolls now the first thing you need a shrimp tempura and if you don't know how to do that please see our other video we explained in depth how to make shrimp tempura to make great rolls now when you do that you want to make sure you have your shrimp tempura as I said and the first piece you want the tail to stick out at the end and on another note if you don't know how to make the Maki sushi for the rolls the base there for the sushi rolls please see our other video because we explain how to do that as well now you'll notice that our lovely model is pulling the tails off the shrimp you definitely want to do that for the pieces that are going to be in the middle so you remove the tails from the pieces that will be in the middle and the two shrimp on the ends you want those to have the tail stick out I you know you do the occasional person who likes to eat the tail but that's what you want to do is have the ones on the end stick out and the ones in the middle pulled off and the key ingredient for your flavor here is the unagi sauce unagi means eel and Japanese so it's really eel sauce and for those of you don't know don't worry it doesn't taste like eel it's actually a really sweet sauce so just a little bit goes a long way we just want to add a hint of that flavor now once we get to that point we want to go ahead and start rolling up the sushi so as you can see we pull the bamboo mat up and over and firmly squeeze the sushi roll at all portions not to really pulverize the shrimp but really to get it to be one solid piece there you go there's the firm gripping motion notice it's firm not not an overkill you really don't want to smash your shrimp here so there we go one more time to really complete the roll all the way across and get all the rice to stick together and that's what you're going to want it to look like right there there you go now we're going to put it on a cutting board and here's what we're going to apply our toasted sesame seeds and these really add that little extra hint of flavor that's really good and after that we're going to cut our sushi and we really really advocate using a sharp knife as possible for this it really helps with the rice and the stickiness and there you go that's how you want to cut it basically pick the center point and work from there there we go so really this is going probably one of the smoothest if any of you have tried to cut roles with knifes that aren't sharp you know it can be quite difficult and really sometimes you get a mess but but sometimes you have nice clean cuts so after you've cut your sushi you want to go ahead and put it out on your display plate or your serving plate we're using a sushi Gator plate and in the case of shrimp tempura not only do we put the Nagi sauce on the inside we also want to put a touch of it on the outside too now too much just enough for some light decoration and a little bit of flavor and that should just about do it here's what our final product looks like and trust me it was absolutely delicious this is a real good recipe for you guys to use out there so thanks for watching we appreciate likes and comments please ",

Even if you say maintenance, it's generally easy to make rolls or sushi that you can eat at restaurants, so it's especially easy to make in other processes. I'd like to explain mainly about sushi. It's time to make sushi, but the most important thing is to choose the ingredients. Now there are vegetables, fish and shellfish, but if you can choose fresh and very ingredients, that's 90%. I think I've already made delicious sushi. A Ingredients are important. First, I'll make sushi vinegar with sushi. Then, keep it on the heat and mix it until it boils. If it boils on this manma fire, it's a relationship of sushi if you can cool it as it is . First, I will explain how to mix sushi rice. If you don't have it, you can use a ball. And the most important thing is not to knead the sushi. Please do not knead the rice. Continue to sheet the blue hair as it is. If you get a raw sushi, grate it. It's made from shark skin, but please lower it with these fine-grained sushi. When you lower it, gradually lower it like drawing a. If you can get this, it's best.  I think you can make the best sushi with a good fragrance, but I think it's difficult to keep it in London, so please use such powdered sushi or kneaded and frozen sushi. First of all, I think it's the easiest to make at home. I'd like to make hand- rolled sushi. way to eat sushi that you can wrap and eat whatever you like, so I think you can enjoy it very much at parties, etc. First, I will cut Suzuki. I can say this to all fish.  However, every fish always has a number . The direction in which the streaks are running. Cut this. Do not cut. If you cut it like this, you will cut the streaks.  In order to make effective use of its length and curve, it is cut by holding Hojo without any force to the basement so that the cucumber is used properly from the base to the tip. Next, I will cut the tuna. Next, the part of the large Toro that is the same as this. This is a very stiff muscle, so I have to cut the muscle, so when I cut it I will cut it in this direction. It's fine if you set the table up to the table and roll what you like and enjoy it. As for how to make it, first pick up one piece of the method and stretch the finished sushi rice and put it in. For example, if you use tuna, put it in one piece of Emma Black . You can also add cucumber if you like. If and hot water, and Then, I will explain about Henigiri sushi. You can see it by looking at the last picture of what everyone made, but I think that the shape balance is all different. It doesn't matter how you make it, and there is no rule that you have to do it if you want to make it perfect. ",

        "content": "hello everyone and welcome back to cooking with a twist I'm making sushi rolls here at home so I invite you to do the same I'm going to start off on teaching you how to make the roll the method to make it but of course like with any recipe you can switch up the toppings the proteins fruit or vegetables they go in it I'm making something that would represent like a dragon roll so I'm going to use the smoked salmon and I'm going to season it with a few spices and other ingredients then leave with some cucumbers and then I'll show you the final project a bit and this is something you could be really creative with you can make it into anything really so good my sushi rice already but for the three cups that I use they seasoned it with half a cup of rice vinegar 2 tablespoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of salt I cooked that I actually cooked it on high up until it boiled for about five minutes and then I cooked it for another 20 minutes but I made sure it that I was on a like about low medium and then I turned it off and just kind of let the rice sit until it absorbs all the water you want to check up on the race that it's just nice and soft but not mushy you can use scallions for this that I'm using chives I mean our mince my smoked salmon you can use two enough for this make sure if you use two Nets a sashimi grade or sushi grade which means that it's been um gone through a process of freezing process to kill the germs but because I'm using a smoked salmon it looks like it's raw but it's actually not and you want to finely dice this when you get sushi or like a dragon roll that has that spicy tuna they tend to be very mushy I don't like that so I'm dicing it but if you like it to be more processed just put it in a blender as far as the spiciness goes I usually use about a tablespoon of sriracha and about another tablespoon of chili garlic sauce now I'm going to be adding my sesame seed oil about a tablespoon of that and some rice wine vinegar and about another tablespoon of it I'm gonna mix all these ingredients together and then throwing those chives in the salmon I've cut my cucumber vertically because it's longer that way and it's easier for it to roll down the sushi now if you don't like the seats you can remove that but I don't mind so I'm gonna keep those here I'm covering my bamboo mat with some saran wrap so the sushi doesn't stick to it and I do this several times and then fold the edges so it's nice and neat lightly oiled my sushi mat with some olive oil just that makes it easier for me to roll out the sushi now we're going to add our rice that has been cooled down to my nori seaweed sheet and you want to add rice almost all the way you want to leave a little gap so it makes it easier for rolling I start setting my cucumber down now we left a little gap because I'll make it a little easier for it to roll out so you're going to roll it and then tighten this and you open it back again and you keep rolling this out and you're the same I'm in very tight and then you left your bamboo mat again and you roll it keep doing that and we turn it around and I just do it once more just to make sure it's nice and rounded here I'm cutting my avocado thinly because I want to create a criss cross hatch pattern so it looks like scales since I'm creating a dragon just overlapping them feet over each other just cover it with saran wrap just to make it a little bit easier for me to actually touch the avocado and start rounding it out a little bit so start pressing and then you could use your sushi mount and help it a little now we're going to cut it into pieces I keeping the saran wrap on there it also makes it a little easier so for my dragon I've added some black sesame seeds some jalapenos cucumbers that tongue is actually red bell pepper that I've shaped the eyes are made out of mayo sauce topped with some sesame seeds and then I tucked the entire thing with sriracha and some mayo sauce so get creative and I'll see you in the next video thank you ",

        "content": "welcome back to yet another sushi video recipe I'm chef David DeVoe and I'm gonna show you guys how to make a dragon sushi roll today now I'm sorry about the humming noise in the background that's this fan thing here see it's about thirty degrees Celsius in the shade today so yeah it's ridiculously hot that's 86 degrees Fahrenheit for you American guys I have to look that up secondly go anyway let's get straight wings of sushi okay so you put a sheet of nori onto a bamboo rolling mat with a plastic bag on it and then just wet your hands a little bit in some water so the rice will stick to you and what I'm using here is 120 grams of cooked sushi rice now you can know how to make this by the link that just appeared on top left corner and simply just spread it out and only spread it over half of it now 120 grams is about 4 ounces just spread it out nice and softly fluff it out don't press it down you really just want to separate the rice over the surface area you don't want to compress it that happens later when you roll it then you just flip it over and then on the empty side is where I'm going to put my filling what you do is you lay three tempura prawns now you can learn how to make these by clicking on the link that spit on top left corner which will take you to a video of mine where you learn how to make this now you just add three slices of avocado and a little bit of unagi sauce when I get sauces eel sauce you can get this in any Japanese food store otherwise just buy it online or you can buy it from my store a link or just spit on top left corner and you can buy it there okay so now the roll you just simply bring it over and then just pull back and then just pull forward and like so if you need a roll reference about it then just click on the link with your top left corner and that's the video about rolling right covered this is unagi or grilled eel now it's very difficult to find this fresh fresh eels here in Spain where they've been probably around the world too so it's best just to buy the frozen stuff it comes already grilled and ready to go it will last for very long time in the freezer you just throw it and then I would suggest grilling it a little bit inside the oven or on a little BBQ called don't burn it though just a little bit of grilling just to revitalize all the flavors in there any wage is very simple I mean you go you guys know how to open packages it's it's not very complicated just pull it out and this is more that's how it looks like now for my sushi roll I don't actually want to use the entire eel so I only want to use half so I'm just going to cut it enough look at it this is just beautiful stuff anyway just you'll need about half-full sushi roll to put on top and the other half you can make a notice if you roll with or put it inside another sushi roll that's fine just add some avocado paprika a little bit of unagi sauce good to go and it's very important I prefer to have this served warm just don't unfold and give it out at least put it in the microwave minimum bare minimum the best would be a charcoal grill or really a little bit underneath the oven now once you grill this does become very soft so I would suggest being very careful with it right now to finish the sushi roll I've grilled my eel and what you do is just place it on top like so and you want the tail to come out the NPAC so perfect now you add a piece of cling film just to fix it all together and now press it onto the sushi roll but everything is one piece now like so perfect now you take your knife dip it in some water so the blade is just slightly wet and what you want to do is cut it about here perfect and now just cut your sushi rolls to required length all right perfect now to shape it up again I remove the cling film and now you take a little strip of nori and just stick it on like so now these are half sheets and then cut your strips you don't want to cover the entire you just you want to keep it together because otherwise what happens is antisocial or fall apart when you try to take one I've experienced a lot of times as renewing so I like to do like this okay beautiful okay so now to plate it up you just simply put them onto a plate like so and this here is like the Dragons tail is now to decorate it which would have put some octopus suckers and this would be the eyes these are you know I just have these lying around but I mean if you go to the fishmonger and just ask them to chop off a couple of suckers he'll be happy to oblige a thing a quick little garnish for the dragon roll this is half a cucumber and basically what you do is just slice it in very thin slices okay all the way across all right perfect I just take the side pots away okay now what you do is just line them up hold it together and put your knife 45 degree angle and cut perfect discard this and now what you want to do is just peel off about half and just find them out like so okay take a couple wave is too thick and then take a couple more and then find them out the opposite way just like so now put this on the side and just garnish for the Dragonball now you take your cucumber and you put one on one side and the other one on the opposite side just like so push the sushi rolls together so that stays put and now two of these paprika slices perfect alright so you just take a deep fried shrimp head and you pull the whiskers off alright now you take the whiskers of the prawn and you just push them into your very soft eel it shouldn't be too difficult perfect is now to finish it off some sources you are a little bit more eel sauce unagi sauce onto the roll perfect then on to the plate you add a little bit of mayo this is garlic mayo both sides perfect then some sriracha sauce over the Mayo like so and then you take a little stick and you make it look a little bit like fire just by pulling it through it awesome now you add a little bit of pickled ginger and your wasabi and your time perfect ultimate dragon roll thank you for watching another one my sushi videos I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did then please subscribe to my channel by clicking on the top left corner of your

        "content": "welcome back 11 video I'm chef Devaux and today we're going to do a very special Halloween inspired sushi roll with black sushi rice and dehydrated carrier on the outside it's a very special new concept I hope you guys enjoy it and don't be freaked out with my eyes let's go okay so let's get going what you're gonna need is a carrot and then what you want to do is just clean it and for this I'm just gonna take a knife and just smooth the cut off the skin of the carrot now you don't have to do it this way I just like to do it this way and you like to use my beautiful knives but you can just use a normal peeler to peel off the skin no problems there okay so just gonna quickly peel this off and there I love using the knife like this in this way I just love using my knife is just it's a pleasure to work with these in the kitchen and that's I think what's all about when you buy some ways what I'm talking about this knife if you guys want to buy it you can check it out on my website if you're in Europe by clicking on table when screen if you know in Europe then click underneath it to go to my website to check out the knives in America and so that okay so I'm just going to cut off the edges and then discard all this excess and now I'm just going to use a microplane or you can use a cheese grater or something else great assist students livers of characters they're great just watch out for your fingers not to scrape the fingers away because that can really happen just at the end don't bother game the last outfit just eat the pics of Trumpets at this pretty little anyway okay so once you're done you take the grated carrot and you spread it around on one of these levels of the dehydrator now what you want to do is just spread it out very nice and thinly and you want to fill up all the trays and just fill it up if you want one of these you can check it out by clicking on the top left corner screech they're pretty cheap to buy and they're pretty cool to put stuff in tonight okay so what's going to happen is it's going to blow hot air through it and over the course of a day it's get a dehydrator to crispy character so here we go it's been overnight and I'm just going to turn it off and then this is the crispy outcome of the carrot it's really crunchy crispy amazing texture it's just great it's like carrot chips and you can make carrot chips if you just you cheese knife instead and create thin strips now what you want to do is you want to take these and put them away from humidity so we're gonna put them inside an airtight up like this and just pack it in there completely and seal it up and it's very important to keep away any humidity because the slightest bit of dampness and these characters become soggy so you really don't want them and then you can store this away for quite a while just the longer you store it it does become a little bit oxidized so you just try to use as fast as possible ok so now for the rice what you want to make is black water and this is basically just squid ink and water and what I'm using is about five to six grams of squid ink for every hundred milliliters of water and I'm adding this water into the sushi rice so here I'm just going to add the squid ink you can buy this usually by the fish mongers and if you just ask someone will know somewhere close to you in the supermarket a place to buy it alright so what you want to do is just blend the squid ink with the water and this we just infused together you just whisk it you seem to get new lumps of twinning going in the water you don't want that you've got just be one uniform liquid okay so now he's gonna add this water to my sushi rice just like you would normally I've watched this sushi rice already and now he's gonna cook inside the rice cooker now if you don't know how to make sushi rice check out the sushi rice recipe by clicking on top left where sweet and you go to my website where you'll see my recipe now just this is the highlight I'm not showing you the quantities or anything I'll just go to the website there on top left corner to figure that out but look at this right it's now deep black color it's just it's an awesome change from what you always have the sushi rice which I find very interesting ok so now just like normal I'm just gonna season it with the sushi rice vinegar mix just lightly drizzle it over and then just spread it among inside your handiwork ok and now to use the rice take half a sheet of nori paste on a cutting board and then paste 120 around the sushi rice and that's about 4 ounces and spread it out nice and softly and quickly and just don't press it down too much okay a tip here use wet hand slightly damp so the rice is sticky hands much now put bamboo rolling mat inside a plastic bag and flip it over so the rice is now underneath and the noir is on top and now you take a beautiful piece of sashimi grade salmon you can check out what the sushi grade salmon is by clicking on the top left menu screen and just roll it over this you want to close it before it reaches the end and then just seal it now and then roll it over one more time just to shape it and press again okay there we go that's a sushi roll done and now to cut it I'm just gonna move it slightly take my knife and just wipe it on a damp cloth so the rice doesn't stick to it much and then just slice it in half and then wipe it again keep wiping in between cuts and you're going to cut the halves into quarters now and the quarters into eighths and now the other quarter into 1/8 and I'm going to go back to the other half and cut that into quarters again and then those quarters into eighths so here we've got eight pieces of sushi now I'm just gonna reshape it again just the case it's just any rice might go out of shape perfect and now I'm going to remove the side piece because I find the bit not that beautiful so just remove them you can eat them just I don't like to take them but it's now I'm just gonna add my crispy carrot which we make earlier on top of the sushi roll now the reason why I'm adding this is the end after cutting and not before because this stuff becomes soggy so fast I guess that before so if you put it on before and then you cut it and then you press it into the sushi roll what happens is it just becomes a soggy mess and it's just not what I'm looking for so by adding this after I cut it it remains crunchy and crispy and it's just it's an experience it's something special right so again I'm just gonna put some more on the top be generous with and cover it all the way around the sushi roll Peters be careful to keep all the pieces together so you don't get crispy carriage stuck on the sound and only on the outside of the sushi roll get a nice beautiful cover and put some more on top okay nearly done there we go okay just put this to one side take a plate to plate up beautiful Japanese plate okay and now he's going to take a sushi roll piece and place it onto the plate like this there we go make another one put it behind and that you guys can plate up obviously with the entire roll but I'm going to show you to now put a little bit of pickled ginger and a little bit of fresh wasabi there we go this is the Halloween sushi roll done okay so this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed it and if you found this video useful then

        "content": "welcome back to lurking video today I'm going to show you a very interesting arty sushi roll with a dog picture the inside made of fish and rice so when you cut it in half you'll see the dog in your sushi it's a very interesting thing to do let's get going just cook it alright start off by taking a baby cucumber and a mandolin and set it to two millimeter thickness so you get extremely thin slices of cucumber and firmly press it down and slice it across the blade just like so now you want to have very very thin slices so they extremely flexible okay so here we go now I've got my slices I'm just going to take one of these nice flexible slices lay down on the cutting board and cut off the edges so you have a slice of cucumber about two centimetres wide which is 4/5 of an inch there we go and I'm going to take half sheet of nori which is conveniently about the same width as the cucumber and just slice a piece off that's long enough to just wrap around the cucumber once there we go once you've wrapped it down you just want to place a book on it or something to compress it down so it adheres to the nori and again I'm just going to take another slice and this time going to cut a half a centimeter thick slice so that's 1/5 of an inch just like this and dispose of the rest and again just take a piece of nori and cut it just wide enough so it can wrap around the cucumber once so here I'm just going to put the cucumber and roll it round so that I can just cover it with this okay and again just place it underneath the book so they can properly adhere and compress to it there we go alright so this is the two slices the thin one and the thick one and this will do look like more that's when they compress all right I'm going to taking sushi rice a little bit at a lot and add some black and blue and mix it and there we go dueces you race okay now I'm going to take a thin strip of nori about two and a half centimeters one inch and I'm going to add about ten grams of black sushi rice I'm going to put it lengthwise across the noise just like so and then I'm going to roll this into a simple roll and this will make the nose of the dog later so once you've done that and made it perfect just put that to one side until your knees now I'm going to take the thick piece of cucumber that I'm a just a second ago and add a little bit of rice on top about four to six grams of sushi rice and then I'm just going to curve this into a C shape and the rice helps keep it in that C shape and the reason for this is so it can make the mouth of the dog with a little slight curve to it alright so once you've done that just put this to one side until you need it later okay great now I'm going to take the thin slice of cucumber and do the same but this time with much much less rice I'm just going to take a single grain at a time and place them in a single file just like so and then again just curve this up into a C shape so that it can also be slightly curved and once that's done then just put this to one side until it's needed later and I'm going to take half sheet of nori and a quarter sheet of nori and join them together using some rice glue just place the rice on one of the sides just like this and then just cover it with the other sheet and then press down and this will make one long sheet of nori just like this now you take your rolling mat and just place it down and place your nori on top and they take a hundred grams of cooked and seasoned sushi rice and just start spreading it from one side going towards the other side and it should cover about three-quarters of your sheet just softly spread it out nice and gently now it's very important that this segment here is a little bit less rice because that will make the earlobe a donee damaged rice so take a little bit from there and to the other end okay now I'm going to take my salmon and just place it down on the edge and then just roll it over just like so until three of the four sides of the salmon are covered with Reisman order and I'm going to take some rice and place it on the fourth side just like this now this you want to do - I there's no set amount just where you feel it right and this will make the top of the head of the dog once you've done that just roll it over on top of the rice and then just bring it to the side of your mat and press it against it then take a hand towel and just press it against that so it keeps in place while you're working just like so now I'm going to take a little bit more rice and just press it into corner just like this again just do it with your better judgement of what you feel is right for this section and then you want to put the eye part of the cucumber so the thin strip and place it with the rice facing upwards just like so then you want to cover that in some more sushi rice just like this again just use your better judgement for what you think is right here now you take your thick piece of cucumber with rice facing down and you just want to put it at a 45 degree angle just so it is pointing towards the eye pot and now you just want to fill in the gap between the earlobe and the mouth just like so making sure not to cover the leading edge of the mouth there okay I think this is just right and now I'm going to add just a little bit more rice just here just to give it a little bit more body and here I'm just going to start rolling just bring it towards the ear and then press it down okay great now I'm just going to flip this thing over and compress it like you would a sushi roll just so it becomes one piece great now I'm going to create indentation here which would be the classic curvature of the dog face okay so just use your matter compress it down great and now I'm just going to tuck in the edges because the rice coming out a little bit so I'm just going to put them out over it and tuck it in and then do to the other side just tuck it in maybe better to use them up and then tuck in okay and now again I'm just going to work on that annotation just press it down with your fingers or you can better use the rolling mat to press it down in a single weight just like this okay great now you've got a beautiful curve there and that's just what I'm looking for all right now I'm just going to add a little bit of blue sushi right so later when I roll it that indentation stays in place so you just add what you believe is right there again perfect okay so take two half sheets of nori which are being glued together again like I did before and you want to take some blue sushi rice and just start covering it from one side start off by covering about half of this long sheet and then you'll stop and see where you're exactly at and maybe a little bit more of sushi rice data okay I'm just going to place the dog face down so I can judge how much more rice to put and I'm just going to add that black sushi rice roll we made before there is a nose at the front end of the dog face just like this and make sure there's no gap so press it up against it just like so and just roll it up and here now to check how far the blue sushi rice goes if I need any more now I can see here I need a little bit more just to make it round so I'm just going to take some more blue sushi rice and just fill in this section here correct I think this is just perfect okay so now I'm going to roll this forwards okay great and now I'm just going to roll it like I would a sushi roll again just make it one piece is now that I've compressed it I'm just going to tuck in the sides of the sushi rice again just make a little pretty tuck in this side and tuck in the other side and now to cut the roll I'm going to take my extremely sharp knife and slightly wet it so it goes through the rice easier and just slice through the roll like this and it reveals this beautiful little sushi roll dot and now you can just cut a slice off now it will typically yield about four pieces of sushi and they all look like this dog so there we go this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed it now you know how to make a dog sushi roll which is a great skill to know in life so one last thing if you like this sushi t-shirt with this sushi hugging itself then check out the link in the top left for your screen or in the description below for where you can get yours you can also get it in different colors which is really cool thanks for watching see you guys next week goodbye ",

people paradise right and again selves very very success we met a lot of people you know or sushi I was a little bit to be game worried about stuff because over the I know some ingredients we need to buy an equivalent sure so worried about the really come how about this is stop enough you know making everything right black beads beads all gotta protect everyone worked out fine yeah well y'all thanks so much for being our fan we are nothing without all of you and we mean it from the bottom of our hearts now we got this phenomenal role that hero made up so take a look at it it is our vegan role or vegetarian role so take a look and enjoy and we'll see you all very soon thank you welcome to another episode of Novi kitchen and bar we are with master sous chef he wrote illallah hi hero how are you gonna do excellent alright what's happening in the kitchen today hero yes today we're going to make roll sushi okay but instead of a seaweed or soy paper user-oriented Romain I have never seen that done before up with a sauce rice and all in written okay actually there's a lot of people they don't like the way see we taste so this would be a great substitute like so that's right okay let's go let's do it well inside of it at all I going to use and a cucumber okay red onion okay and tomato avocado steamed asparagus micro green and spring looks okay so this again yeah all vegetarian all right nice very very nice if I'm going to guess I'll cook a little bit okay you're gonna cook it actually alright it's inside okay yes okay so next step pick the romaine lettuce I put into the hot water okay yeah after I went to in high school alright particular result okay right the people the bottom side how long you leave inside a point on a weekly paper you need to see receiver check through that if the software is that's it okay there's not to be long so literally and maybe like ten seconds or so long days that's it okay okay here also after that what's the next step okay next uh Stephie's I need to take them to walk out okay I won't do that it helped and for those of you at home chef's heroes paper tough choices auntie do a quicker picker-upper they would have one choice very very good so I said I said well you can tell the guys more like of me yeah let's go up more deeply yep Oh beautiful okay then next step is I wanna cut off this parts I'm going to pick up this in the center okay I just want to see this authoritative site and also same times I what I don't have bamboo commandos it seems like I your CV okay the size do is I don't find away his bees okay take out the center him with that Matt over here on the center yeah more a little bit more moving okay perfect just want to keep you a leaf that doesn't mean no problem it's okay this is for all of our vegetarian ones out there are vegans this role is for you I know a lot of you were upset with our lobster video but we're trying to redeem ourselves I guess right here and then trying to make peace with the world what are things they know we have to appreciate what a food yes it's not only that killing the animal you know yeah I mean we know this is a lobster but you know we we try to go for the heart a lot of people in read our description and they thought that we were very inhumane in the way we treated a lobster which is furthest from the truth so but still plants were living at one point in time it doesn't matter if it's got organs or not it still was a living organism so now is she doing more than one layers about many layers I yeah I got to do two layers actually between I want to put me down Oesterle I wasn't you know between there I make a little bit derivative asked Tom okay make it stronger cut it okay we're just about ready to roll here here I see that you have the ends of the leaves on one side and then the stalks or the roots more towards away from you is how the fans at home should be doing it as well not bad dating this is not announce absolute you can you can do why sighs okay fine Oh either way either way that's just my OCD taking over okay let's do this it's not ready it's all I'm gonna put down nice okay same as makeup you you set up on that see me okay little by little you cannot you cannot oppressed the way too much you know yeah big the let us gonna be splitted okay so the just be very gentle hesitantly put a nice little Bible once I have plenty vegetables inside I can imagine some meat you know some grilled skirt steak Oh some bacon closing games for motor we go see ya it's nice - okay so that's why I gonna set up the vegetables okay steamed asparagus you must follow us little bit to O'Neill's five of the vegetables with anything we like farik's spinach Momo let us everything okay make you have to come back avocado okay we can tell this a little bit about just it's always a audience' avocadoes perfect yeah but ELISA not so perfect not so perfect and I want to avoid it the brown spot I can use that knife spot okay so I just kind of died nominated us earlier right so let's just hop on inside oh nice okay very very good about you and before you roll that up I just want to get a quick shot here Oh show over fans what this looks like a close I'll get up to saw spring mix spring mix as well okay when I define a cuddle but he okay that's a quick shot of this it's a lot of stuff you can roll up in here and this is where the difficulty part comes in yes I'll take anything up right because if not the less is gonna break right and then you've got just some rice and vegetables okay all right okay don't press too much this minute you can see that right a little slip-up silver like that okay squeeze gently squeeze a little bit next time a long long time gentle squeeze okay okay see that a nice so far perfect one more time let's give nice  I screw it push another vice inside push rice inside of the ends okay you can shape up and next to my the cutting place okay I want to lose a pasty so firm it up yes and the cellophane actually keeps a roll together so it doesn't fall apart especially being that it's cooked to romaine on top now it's going to tell very easily kind of bus house we're going to sink them sharply okay okay and cut into how formal to hop all right so you can cut it to the eight pieces very easy right or maybe you can little bit smaller into this one massive unit of negative intercept night one how many pieces is this 12:12 pieces it's a lot of pieces okay people Ramon okay so how can you plate it so everyone can appreciate the inside of that role actually I'm going to do see the people okay turn the last one inside out so people can see it okay well just watch actually need a little bit on the taskbar hmm yeah that makes I'm gonna be no good so laughter you can see that next time oh nice a really really nice lot of work a lot of hard work here and very very delicate it's definitely one of the harder roles that you've done there are fans out there definitely give it a try if you can so

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hey guys it's amy from the squishy monster and today we're gonna make kimbap which strictly translates to kim seaweed pop breath and i'm gonna show you the way that I grew up eating it but you're more than welcome to go ahead and fill with fresh tuna or canned tuna kimchi spam ham whatever you would like so let's talk about ideas alright so in this bowl I have five cups of cooked rice and I added in about three tablespoons or so obsessed me oil and three teaspoons of sesame seeds but if you don't like that crunch you're more than welcome to keep that out as well as salt and pepper to taste and just mix the whole thing together and you want to keep it covered because you wanted to retain that sheet so when we roll together all that steam and the heat from it just sucks the of the billing together and makes it a neat and nice roll and also I have some pickled radish and sometimes it's yellow sometimes it's white it does make a difference you just want to get some pickled radish and as well as carrots and some beef franks and then I also have some dried seaweed and I don't think this particular brand is available here because my email sent it to me from Korea but it's all the same just sushi paper dried love or dried seaweed whatever and I've actually found these at local supermarkets like Generic supermarkets so you might have some luck with that as well as five beaten eggs and you want to salt pepper to taste when you go ahead and cook that off we're making a thin egg crepe basically and this is gonna make your life a lot easier and this was like 2 bucks in my Asian supermarket and it's just a bamboo mat just to make everything easier and tighter so let's get started so another side note I just went ahead and rinsed off my um radish and just took off the brine because it's sitting in a lot of private and you want to add in the salt that you want to and you don't want to have somebody else dictate the salt that's in it and cut the ends off the carrots and then what you basically want to do is cut it down the middle like this and then you have two parts pass like this and then you just want to cut it in about three times just so you get long strips and then you can leave these raw but I don't really like them with just a little bit of a tenderness to them so just about literally like three minutes two to three minutes I'm going to cook them off with a little bit of sesame oil and salt and pepper so just to have a little bit of softness to them so just like you did with the carrots you're going to want to cut your pickled radish into strips and you want them like this and then you don't want to cut long strips from this as well I've got two pans going and I just like I did with the radish you want to go ahead and rinse your ranks off as well and I just lightly listed this with a little bit of cooking oil you don't want to disturb this until you see basically the edges starting this pan pick on like a pale yellow color and you can see the surface not so runny do you want to let this go and leave it undisturbed cut about a medium to low cheese and just keep your Ohio Franks as well because you want to rotate them so this is my dry piece of seaweed and you can see that this part is kind of a more matte than this shiny part so you want to put the shiny part down I don't know if you guys can feet but this is the shiny part and this is the more matte textured part you want that textured part upside and then the bottom to be the shiny part so go ahead and lay that onto your bamboo mat and go ahead and take your rice and remember it's best if it's hot and then just go and smoosh it down that's a technical term by the way and just smoosh it down just did it an even predominantly thin layer just like in the heat from the rice and from all the the filling will go ahead and suck it all together to make a nice neat and tight roll so like that doesn't have to be beautiful and perfect so go ahead and take one of your egg your pieces of egg and then a piece of your beef Frank then a piece of your carrot and then a piece of your radish basically what you want to do is just kind of freehand roll it at this point let's go ahead and do that making sure all the edges are tucked in just take a little bit of rice just to go ahead and act as kind of like a guru of sorts there we go and then after you freehand roll it I'm gonna bring it up to like the edge a little bit towards you and then just start compacting it very very tightly just kind of squeeze and roll and this is gonna press all of your filling together and just roll as tightly as you can and just squeeze all right and then afterwards you'll have a nice neat roll like this and you want to go ahead and brush the top just because the UM see we can kind of be a little brittle you want to go ahead and brush and lubricate the top with just a little bit of sesame oil and I will show you guys how I cut this take a sharp serrated knife and go ahead and cut the one-inch pieces you don't want them to be huge you want them to be bite-sized so there you go and I'm gonna continue cutting these and this is a great lunch but I recommend you not putting them in the refrigerator because they will go ahead and get rough on you and you can't microwave the whole thing it'll get all mushy and terrible so go ahead and just keep cutting and you can keep them whole feeb like they're just kind of eat like as a Korean burrito that's always nice too so here is my finished product I got about eight rolls from mine but it really depends on how fat you make them and I hope you guys have fun with this let me know I will be really excited to hear about what you guys filled yours with go crazy and wild but have fun with it filled them with avocado cob beef hamburger meat um pierogi shrimp scallops crab whatever I hope you guys have fun with this and share this with your friends and family thanks so much again for spending time with you guys this is a squishy monster and I'll see you guys very very soon bye ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "welcome back to another cooking video I'm chef Devaux and I'm gonna teach you how to make a beautiful plate of sashimi with beautiful presentation and delicious fish so there's nothing more to be said let's get straight into it let's go okay so you take a block of sushi-grade tuna and just start cutting in slices between half centimeter and one centimeter thick depending on how tender it is if it's more tender make thicker slices you just want to cut in a single swooping move across the entire block and separate it in one going now just put it to one side and then you take your tuna block and you pour over sesame seed oil and then you rub it into the tuna block what you want to do is cover all the sizes of to two blocks or later the coriander cilantro leaves will stick to it take your time to make sure it's fully covered and once it's fully covered you want to take some freshly cut but dry coriander or cilantro depending where you live and just cover it over the tuna block if it's not dry before you throw it on it won't stick to the oil properly so just keep that in mind okay once you've properly covered your entire block you just transfer it over to scolding hot pan you really want to hear that hissing searing sound as soon as you drop into packages there we go beautiful now you want to flip it over every 10 to 15 seconds and you want to stare only for sides of the tuna block so here just turning it over just like that wait a couple of seconds again and there we go again so you really don't want to overcook the tuna you want to have the inside still raw and sashimi like you just want to stay a very thin layer on the outside and the coriander so just keep playing it over every 10 to 15 seconds okay so once you're done cooking it taste it on a cutting board on one of the raw sides so it has time to cool down and rest you don't want to have one of the cooked sides against the cutting board and have the heat trapped in between the tuna and the cutting board which will keep cooking your tuna so now what you do is you take a block of sushi grade salmon and just place it on your cutting board and you want to cut at a 90 degree angle to the fat line so place it at 45 degree angle towards you so you can just drag the knife straight down towards you place the knife at a 45 degree angle to the board and just slice through the fish in one motion now you do it again and you want to cut thin slices about half a centimeter thick but if you need to at the end of the slicing motion you could go in the opposite direction just to make sure you completely cut the sashimi slice off the salmon block now just keep slicing through it it should be like slicing through butter with a hot knife if it's not then you need a sharper knife so I would recommend to check out my video on how to sharp knives by clicking on top left corner screen so now you take your seared tuna block which is had time to rest and again just slice it like the first part of the tuna block just simple slices straight down in a single scooping motion now I'm gonna need a saw here a little bit because there's very little of the tuna left so it's gonna become more and more difficult and I'm gonna have to feel my way through with a knife but really you want to just do it in a single swooping motion from start to finish okay this last part I'm really gonna use for ya because there's only two slicing me perfect there we go and I just move the tuna to one side and I'm just gonna clean this right here spread quality there we go so I compared a couple of things and now I'm going to plate up I'm just gonna spread out some thinly sliced cucumber and then just cut the edges off to make it a little bit neater okay there we go I just put this to one side and grab a little bit of shredded carrot now I've shredded this with a cheese grater and that tasted some water for about half an hour to get a bit more crispy take your sliced cucumber and lay it against the carrot like so there we go okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my salmon slices and lay them across the board overlapping each other just slightly in a straight line and then what I'm going to do is just start rolling them up into a salman rosette you want to roll it up very loosely so that the salmon sort of falls apart on the plate and not to take it I so just paste it on the board there we go just like this looking great / okay so now just take a little bit of grated radish again I graded this on cheese grater and left for half an hour and sliced some water okay then I'm gonna take my seared tuna slices and lay it up against the cucumber slices just like so I'm going to take a lemon slice it in half and then a 45 degree angle to the center line I'm gonna slice some very thin slices about 1/2 million minutes thick I don't need many about 10 to 15 slices will do just like so then I'm just gonna spread them out in a diagonal line and this just adds a little bit of lights to play nice extra color and just makes it look a little more fresh so just lay it up against the tuna there we go perfectly now I'm just gonna take two little leaves of lettuce and place them on the board in between the salmon and the cucumber and then I'm gonna add some shredded cucumber again I shred this with a cheese grater and left in water for half now and now I'm gonna place my tuna sashimi slices up against my shredder to come back okay so here I've taken avocado peeled it and slice into thin slices and now I'm just going to spread them out evenly and then place the knife underneath it and curl it up into a cone shape you will be very careful with this because every color is very very delicate when it's on its own and to shape it you might need to use your fingers just like this there we go yeah there okay so once it's inside a cone shape more or less like this is very delicate so pick it up by putting your finger inside and then transfer it over to your platter and now you place it down next to the lemons and what you want to do is add a little bit of sturgeon caviar this is delicious stuff and it's quite expensive but it had something nice okay this is real sturgeon caviar from rio frio i also use this inside the millionaire sushi roll you can check that out by clicking on the link on top left corner to be right out if you haven't seen my video now i'm just gonna add some pickled ginger just like this you always eat pickled ginger with sushi and now I'm just gonna add a little wasabi flour this is just a little piece of what's a big case with cuts into it okay so now I'm just gonna add a little bit of chives on every single slice of this tuna sashimi this is adds a little extra touch a little bit more color a little bit more vivid presentation it's all about what you see and then what you taste so this just adds a little something okay so there we go sushi cut out done so there we go this is the end of the video I hope you enjoyed it and if you want to see more sushi be videos hit the thumbs up or like button down there somewhere he'll just hit like button anyway you know it helped me out okay so if you want to get

        "content": "ok so first off you're gonna need some raspberry juice now I like to use frozen raspberries they have a much more sour taste in the fresh raspberries do and it works really well with sushi instead of the sweetness that you get in fresh batteries so I'm just gonna defrost some raspberries put them through a juicer and then I have a juice now if you don't have a juicer you can also do it by another method which I've shown before in an earlier video I'll link to that core to that video [Music] there you go raspberry juice done oh it's now I'm gonna take some masago which is season capital in the row and then mix the red beet juice into it oh it's nice girl wanna let this marinate put it in the fridge and forget about it for bit five to ten minutes should be enough but the longer the better obviously just don't do it too long ahead more an hour is really unnecessary okay so the rat reduces be marinated with masago for about ten minutes and now you're gonna pour it out into a sieve to let the raspberry juice drain out it's gonna take a little bit of time foot drain out so just put it underneath the bowl and let it drain out naturally takes about five to ten minutes once you're done you spread it out over a plate and you can keep it in the fridge till you need it right so you start off by placing your bamboo rolling mat in a plastic bag on your board and then you place half sheet of nori on top now you wet your hands just like Lee so the rice doesn't stick to your hands as much and you add four ounces about 120 grams of sushi rice over your half sheet of nori and you just simply spread it out nice and softly you want to fluff it out not press it down take your time with this now you flip it over then you add sushi grade salmon if you don't know what sushi grade fish is click on the link on top left corner screen now and you'll get worth making about that menu add some cucumber and two pieces of imitation crab meat and then you begin rolling by picking up the backend and rolling it over the filling then you press it release roll forwards compress again release for all fours all the time and press one more time and there you go that's your sushi roll done all right so once you finish your roll you just move to the side and bring your plate with raspberry Kaplan row and now you just simply roll it inside it will stick to the rice automatically we have to do just keep rolling around until you get a nice even coverage and once you're satisfied you pull it out and get ready for cutting once you're finished rolling inside your raspberry masago you cover it in some cling film press the cling film on with another bamboo rolling mat this one without the plastic bag on it you will dip your knife into water just hood a drop of water runs across the edge of the blade this will stop the rice sticking to your plate as much and then you start cutting now I like to start cutting on one end and just slice off a little excess piece and then go and start cutting my sushi roll piece now I know how thick I want them to be so it ends up being with about seven to eight pieces every few cuts you want to wipe your knife on a wet rag so the rice isn't accumulate on the plate creating resistance when you cut and I continue cutting [Music] once you finish all the cups then you press it back again and then remove the cling film and then the chef eats the end pieces the test that the roll is perfectly fine for whoever might be eating at the end if all is okay you proceed to plating up you can present your sushi on any plates you want but if you happen to want to use same while I'm using this video right now you can check it out and many more by clicking on the link on the bottom left of the screen and going to my website and what I've done okay so this is the end of the video now I hope you guys enjoyed it if you didn't want to continue watching me cook stuff then check out all my videos by clicking on the right right now also if you want to see me on a regular basis I make one new video a week more or less you can subscribe to my channel by clicking on top left for your screen it's completely free and you'll be updated when you're very released thanks for watching till next week goodbye ",

        "content": "done so good to see it broke down here your spot you know means barbecue love sushi last time I was here you showed me how to do a barbecue this time around we're doing sushi that's right what's special about this is just you will meet one-on-one and our bond row will be actually of a friend planning from Moy oh he's gonna be joining us today so we're all gonna be there together okay that's fine that's fine oh no this is actually Sam Sam misses all right I know him new Hawaii right yeah aren't you know something yeah yeah you guys do the video so yeah a few minutes yeah you guys did videos - hilarious yeah arias I don't know if you about you but I've been very honored to do the sushi with Duke and I've been training while we make videos were also trained for sushi so oh you did yeah well I don't know but it's your first time actually I grew up making sushi did you yeah yes I said brought me here and we're both gonna teach you oh that's funny so you grew up because I came out the womb with the sushi roll that kind of good mom that's how I do it [Music] yeah I'm gonna be making sushi and since you guys are experts in this right yeah I used to be an expert but then I leveled up yeah I'm level - they're gonna grab some gloves over there okay those come on your hats yeah thanks interesting the way you put your gloves on there afraid yeah yeah so interesting about it looks like a seal trying to put on a dress and the basics of sushi right did you guys know it yeah well it's the most important part of sushi just remind me again I don't make sure that he knows what you're talking about yeah I know refresh it we just we just don't usually say it in English I will come from with all that's the most important thing ok sushi up now most important part of sushi is actually the right yes so what about the rest the sushi rice is not just like regular rice how you get in our plate lunch is it it's it's acidified acidify awesome yeah so I feel like crazy looks like this wouldn't we're to start rolling basically what we need to do is we need to get our gloves little oiled up okay so burning grab some sesame seed oil put a little drop on there to grab a bowl right sit thank you so everyone making sushi is gonna advise us to experts will make the sushi while sound watches is gonna pass the rice there is no problem I'll come on right here yeah just bring it along so okay so want to make some sushi on the spot you know yeah okay oh we don't know that we're doing bigger ones here yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] my should it look like this or should I be messy like Sam yeah you should be clean like this ok we'll do is I'm grab the ball okay or put her right on the sushi booty so this is a beach diet is a little bit dull this side is Shane you know so the Chinese always on the outside yeah rice goes on the dog side on the dull side just like Brian's personality oh yeah and then the outside is shiny like Sam said okay so the key is when you're spreading on the rice you don't want to like smash it into the seaweed you want to spread it out with your fingertips right oh the non funny videos that kind of makes all around for some of my face that I have to see it yeah when it's getting kind of dry like Sam's humor drying out is that okay all grab some cucumbers probably about three or four strips on each half right here brian has spiders just building more about you just like his hairdo maybe Sam should have no strips oh because next we're gonna put an avocado ooh so you guys know how to cut an avocado you do a Retief you wanna show us out actually I think Sam she's not here so that he knows how to do it so that's gonna do okay so basically we're not put the knife through and it's gonna hit the seed on the inside slice it that's exactly how I would have done it yeah exactly mine too basically you just come in just get a thin slice nice I want to see how Craig goes with this one yeah yeah you're eating yet you just this is just a cutting right it's showing all he should have cut it see how his is a whole nother slice like ah yes Seattle big let's do that out that's how nice okay you guys are doing a California roll you gotta get the the white imitation crab so this is visitation like so you grab like him drive it like this and use that these are three though with a three technique that's right just kind of we got like supportable we're gonna grab the rice from underneath you now we're in a roll so we'll hold the three fingers yep on all the meats inside the veggies I'm scrolling got all the people rolling in their grave right mix a video sounds can spill in out of all edges when there's a way to give this videos I don't have here so we're gonna do is roll it on top they're gonna squeeze it from the bottom not like smash it down but just put your fingertips I guess like it's a sushi roll right yeah just go first yeah I didn't either Matt oh yeah yeah my hands naturally curving a bamboo this is pretty nice now we cut okay so you know it's good at cutting creighton oh yeah you nice to cut the cheese yeah when you played it you can play it like this okay just kind of you grab up grab all of it make a little arch do that or you could just kind of flip it on its side just plate it I like that I kind of like to go with the 33 degree angle yeah kind of that's pretty corny science is more appetizing mmm-hmm stead of whatever that mess is over there I like to space it out like the eyelids employee you know yeah but this one is you know after a hurricane passport so have you ever had a student that's horrible it's great not yet probably not yeah only anyone is ever done but think what he meant to us as artistic to creative God I mean it is very artistic artistic yeah that's what he calls videos because they're not very funny yeah artistic you see simple plain cut boring videos you got that my sushi is probably a lot funnier and better quality than his sushi what I think we need to focus on is the results because my sushi is gonna taste way better than his no but his sushi is all over the place to mess my videos are like really focused focused on the humor and relatability to everyone else watching my videos have culture their personality they teach people things it's not just this cookie cutter boring robot kind of videos I put a lot of work into my videos I want people to be happy not dead like hit video Sushi's is that right yes oh yeah yes son you you need to tell us whose videos are which videos better sighs do you like more please there's our horrible billion suggest you guys make videos I didn't know you guys had videos but to make videos I thought that's what you had us no one I invited you guys to make sushi we're gonna make sushi well he makes videos too with him Paris and those guys it's super funny he makes videos like Russell Artie Kili it's pretty hilarious oh yeah yeah like a really hilarious actually I didn't know that see tell them a video

        "content": "hi and a huge welcome to steve's kitchen earlier in the week we made the sushi rice the perfect sushi rice and then i went on to use that to make an onigiri well it seemed a natural progression that we make the rolled sushi nick so i'm going to show you today how to make a very simply the rolled sushi and i'm going to do the inside out style and the outside in if there is such a thing now if you haven't made the rice already i'll leave that link just here and we're going to take it from that stage where the rice has come off the stove and now we're going to make that vinegar with a little sweetness in it to pour over the rice to make our sweet in vinegar we start with half a cup of rice vinegar Japanese rice vinegar and into that I'm putting quarter of a cup of white sugar and about a teaspoon of salt now we're just going to take that over to the stove and warm it gently not to heat it vigorously just until the salt and the sugar has dissolved so we're not looking to boil the vinegar we're just looking for the last grains of salt and sugar to dissolve and get a nice clear liquid again and that is what we're looking for so I'll just set that aside now and use it with our prepared rice now have my perfectly cooked rice here and before when I made the onigiri I poured the rice onto a wooden board now the Japanese have these beautiful wooden bowls and I haven't got one of those but you must use either a wooden or a plastic bowl because otherwise the vinegar will react with anything metal so we're just going to put the rice now into this bowl and then using a rice spoon or a soft edged wooden spoon we just want to gently spread the rice across the bottom of our container and then we just want to take our sweet and vinegar and just pour it over the spoon not directly onto the rice just trickle it over the top of our sushi rice and then again using that soft edged spoon we're just going to turn the rice gently and it will slowly start to absorb the sweetened vinegar and by treating the rice very gently all the grains stay complete which just makes pretty sushi now that sweetened and seasoned vinegar has absorbed into the gluten that surrounds the rice now adding a wonderful flavor to this now we just want to evenly spread the rice across the bottom of our container and let it completely cool down and then we're ready to start making sushi now there's a wonderful little story that I've heard from Japanese chefs where these little bits of rice that are on the side of the bowl need to be pushed back down into the family otherwise they become dry and brittle and can ruin your sushi now if you know what that is comments down below and also it's a good idea just to cover the rice over with a damp cloth to stop it drying out there are a whole load of things you can put into sushi you can be as adventurous as you like I'm keeping it fairly simple one of my favorites a little bit of tuna with some Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise in there you can also use these crab sticks which are very popular with the California rolls carrots cut into little julienne matchsticks cucumber of course and the ever-present avocado and of course for our sushi we're going to want some nori sheets now I'm going to be using a full sheet of nori but you can make slightly smaller sushi if you want and you would do that by cutting a full sheet in half or actually folding it in half the best way I find is to fold the sheet of nori over one way and then fold it back on itself and that basically breaks the spine of the nori sheet and then you can very easily just pull that apart and you've got two halves of a nori sheet but as I say I'm going to use a full sheet for this recipe so now we've got all our ingredients together we can get on and make the sushi rolls I'm going to be using one of these bamboo rolling Metz and I've got my sheet of nori this is a shinier side toy but the shiny side down so I'm going to be taking about 250 grams 8 ounces of our sushi rice and spreading it on to our nori sheet and when you're handling the sushi rice your hands should be a little bit damp now I've got a bowl of water here just putting my hands into it to keep them damp not soaking wet but when you're handling the rice it won't stick if your hands are damp and as we push it across the nori sheet we want to leave about an inch at the end there so when we roll the nori up we have a nice clean edge to our sushi so you can see there the thickness that I've gone it's probably about half an inch thick with the sushi and I'm going to do this one we're just a regular crab stick so I take a couple of crab sticks and I'm also going to put some carrot in here you just evenly place the carrot along the sushi and I'm also going to put a few Julian's of cucumber on there as well and we've made sure that the edge of our nori is up against the bamboo like this and we're just going to lift it you can either lift it by hand and just pull the ingredients towards you and roll the sushi over like that now what will we're looking for is to bring if I can show you there bring the edge of our nori seaweed to meet the blank piece of nori that we left free and you want to compact and squeeze the sushi together and then what you can do is hold the bamboo mat like that and just firm up the sushi by pull it back towards you now what I like to do is just take a little bit of water and run it along the edge of that before we close the sushi up and then we can roll the sushi completely over and seal it like so now at this point if you wanted to make the sushi square you could actually squeeze the sushi into a square shape actually I'll make this one a little more square or you could leave it round and there we have it there is our sushi roll ready to slice now it's a good idea to have a good sharp knife and it's also a good idea to run water over it before you slice the sushi we have a little salvaged end here that is just going to cut off and then the rest of the sushi roll we want to cut about maybe three quarters of an inch just over a centimeter and there you have our beautiful little sushi rolls and we can just cut these all the way along occasionally we just want to dampen the knife so that is my sushi with the nori on the outside let me show you now how we're going to make sushi with the rice on the outside now when we're doing our inside-out sushi want to cover our bamboo mat in some cling wrap or plastic wrap like that it'll just stop the rice from sticking to it so for your inside-out sushi we're just going to take another full sheet of nori now you could do this with half sheets of course it would make a smaller sushi get our hands a little bit damp take a good handful of sushi rice actually a couple of handfuls and this time we're going to spread the rice all the way over the nori from edge to edge and when your sushi rice is spread across the nori and again that's about half an inch thick now these are black sesame seeds and they look wonderful but they also taste great when you see them on the outside of the sushi and you just want to sprinkle this over the top of the sushi rice now you can decide how much you like I like it quite thick I want to be able to taste it now if there is a tricky bit at all its lifting up your nori at the end and gently trusting you can flip your rice over the other way up and this time we're going to be putting our filling I'm going to be using advic our dough and tuna just an even distribution across the middle and now I'm taking that tuna which I mixed with a little Kewpie or Japanese mayonnaise and by the way I have a recipe for QP I might actually put that up very shortly on my channel so keep a lookout for that because this is a delicious and unusual mayonnaise and then we're going to roll our sushi over and we're just going to get it to there and pull it in tight continue to roll it over and we want to squeeze the sushi together fairly firmly as we roll and there you have it there is my inside-out sushi you can lift that off there now and again we want to take a sharp knife and just cut the salvage end off and again making sure the blade is wet so it doesn't stick to the rice we are just going to cut off our little sushis and don't they look absolutely fantastic they have it inside out and right way around sushi I hope you've enjoyed this one as I promised I'll also be showing you how to make homemade QP in the next few days I just need to get that video filmed and there is my sushi ready to serve it delicious I can't wait to try some of this I've got the inside out and the outside in I don't know if that's the right term maybe one of my Japanese viewers will give us the correct terminology down below it's been a heap of fun I hope you've learned something today I hope you've enjoyed the video please share the love give this one the thumbs up and look out I'll be doing the kewpie very shortly and I suppose I ought to really try one of these I always do well I'm going to take one of those half sheet nori wants to try not too big a mouthful well not for me anyway let's give this a go delicious that's absolutely fantastic you must try these at home and get the family involved as well it's a lot of fun see you next time thank you for joining me again I'm going to leave some links here to some of the other videos now I've had a little bit of run on Japanese food this week it's been a heap of fun I'd love to hear your comments down below please subscribe to the channel as always be good I'll see you in the next video ",

        "content": "welcome back in this week's episode I'm going to show you guys how to make the amazing vegan sushi roll now this is a delicious vegan sushi roll it is really tasty and if you want to know how to make this just keep watching till the end let's go lightly saute so shimeji mushrooms asparagus and carrots in a pan with some garlic coconut oil and a little bit of seasoned oil get the coconut oil nice and hot get some garlic about two or three clothes just crush them with a knife and chuck them in there to flavor the oil as you cook what you want to do is import flavor onto the vegetables because vegetables a quick glance to tell you the truth so they need a little bit of help you'll just add asparagus I've just cut them in half and couple your carrots and your mushrooms lightly saute them you don't want to overcook them you're gonna get them to have a little bit of color just so it has a little bit more taste than they'd only get a little bit of sesame seed oil just a couple drops to do the idea here is to just get some color onto the vegetables and get them slightly softer I mean the asparagus and the carrot are quite hard vegetables so you just want to get them slightly softer so they don't have that much of a crunch and of course add some flavor to it so take the mushrooms out before the carrots and asparagus because there will be done quite quickly about three minutes should be more less depending on what temperature your pan gets to okay that's the asparagus done so to start to take 150 grams of cooked black and white rice that's 5 ounces and you spread it out nice and softly just keep it on the sheet and spread out to all corners of the sheet you don't want to press down sushi rice just fluff it out slightly so it's still sort of Airy okay there we go now you place it on a sushi rolling mat with a plastic bag round it this is so the rice doesn't get stuck into it it's much easier to do like this now add a little bit of what savvy paste now this is real wasabi if you want to know more about real wasabi a link will appear now on the top left corner and now you add your filling which is the sauteed asparagus then some sauteed shimeji mushrooms and some sauteed carrot slices so now that you have the filling inside the sushi roll you want to just begin at this end curl it over if you want to know more about rolling and how to roll then a link should appear now on the top left corner of the screen the link goes to a video I made especially about how to roll sushi rolls and goes more into depth bugs okay so just compress it nicely and there we go a beautiful black vegan - sure now the key here is just drag tip of the knife through if you do it like this up down what happens ever college guys get stuck to the knife and then it just it becomes a big mess so just drag the tip through the avocado now very simply you can spread out avocado slices half an avocado should do you just spread it up on your hand and once you've got all the slices a nice and spread out more or less the same length as the roll itself just lay it on top and don't worry you can always just keep moving the slices into place so you don't have to get it completely the right size on your hand fix the avocado onto it with the bamboo rolling mat in a plastic bag and now what you can do to make it neater is just slice and just get a nice straight edge on the avocado just makes it look a little prettier now before you cut it you want to put a little bit of cling film over it this will just keep everything in place while you cut it just press it down with another bamboo rolling mat okay and now you want to wet your light in a little bit of water this will keep the rice from sticking to it and just cut off the corners okay beautiful now there's several ways you can cut it to ship I like to just cut in the middle and then cut the halves in quarters and then the quarters at the eighth assuring you have eight pieces what I like to do is I just like to start with one end I know more or less the thickness I want now for this one I wanted a bit thicker because I'm going to put some sauce on top so I'm going to end up with about six to seven pieces of sushi okay so once you've cut it off you can just use a bamboo rolling mat again just to shape back everything in place and then you take the cling film off okay there you go that's the inside of the amazing vegan roll a beautiful little sushi roll now to top it off you just place a little bit of carrot ginger sauce which I made earlier like that now the key is just to keep the point of the cone close to whatever you're doing press it out and then continue pressing as you lift up and this creates a little mountain peak effect a nice easy way to rewatch this video if you don't have time right now or you want to just keep it and then later when you cook have a reference you press down on the bottom where it says add to and then favorites so two clicks add two and then favorites and this way it will just be on a list of favorites and you can just rewatch it anytime you like it's very handy the rice I'm using for this roll is half black rice and half sushi rice now the black rice takes a bit longer to cook then the sushi rice so I first cook the black rice then after a full period of time of cooking the black rice which is about 35 to 45 minutes I add the white rice and then cook it again for the entire time the white rice takes to cook so basically it takes double the time to cook this otherwise still crunchy after just cooking it once I bought this black rice off the internet off the Amazon store now there's a couple different varieties I chose this one it worked quite well I'll put a link up here to my website where you can then see the one I bought for moms lace not much I think it was like 10 pounds or something I bought up the UK store I'll put two good I don't think I've tried buying it off the American Amazon some reason they won't send it even though the same product inside Amazon UK as Alice on America so I just don't understand their policy that ",

        "content": "welcome back to my channel in this week's episode I'm going to show you how to make a cucumber roll is a piece of cucumber some water and a knife now the water is to lubricate the knife so as you're cutting the cucumber then it allows you to slide through instead of not getting bogged down on it now what I've done here is I've already taken the skin off the cucumber with a cheese knife keep the blade wet and then just simply move into it with a knife and you want to keep an eye on the blade you can just see it through the cucumber so you want to keep it so that it's not too thick and not too thin if you lift up the blade like so then you dig deeper into a cucumber making the slices thicker now when you move the blade down like so you actually come more to the surface and you'll cut thinner slices the right thickness would be about a quarter centimeter is tenth of an inch once in a while just take the blade out of the cucumber wet it again so is you have more lubrication and then just continue cutting I'm not using pressure here just let the nether knife do the work and you just guide the cucumber into the way now between cuts you push it up and then when you cut you bring it down so you're always cutting in one direction this gives you a lot of control if you start soaring both ways and cutting then you're going to miss calculate and slip up now this does take a little bit of practice and don't worry too much just buy a bunch of cucumbers try it out I mean these things are pretty cheap anyway okay so now you start getting towards the seeds is when you stop so there we go alright now we just roll this up put one side for later take a little piece of tuna with cutting the tuna just simply put the heel at the owner of the fish so you want to end the cut with the tip on the board should be one fluid motion not too thin you want it quite thick about quarter centimeter to half centimeter which is one tenth of an inch to 1/5 of an inch start at one end and you just cover about one third of your sheet of cucumber okay that's more or less do now you add your avocados a couple slices should do don't overdo it and a little dab of wasabi now you begin rolling no need for anything like a rolling mat simply try to keep it compressed keep rolling when you start to reach the end now here you can add some Mayo or some mascarpone cheese anything it will keep it stuck together it doesn't need to be that could be also yogurt if you want keep it healthy just something to make sure that it sort of stays together otherwise it might unwrap easily okay so there we go and our cutting it you want to keep the seal on the bottom and simply just cut the ends off okay now these to throw away I repeat throw away okay and you just simply want to cut out the slices pretty thin about one centimeter as two-fifths of an inch and that is your cucumber rock simply place your cucumber rolls on the plate okay now you'll daikon which is focused here in the middle a little bit of carrot just to give some color and a couple little greens now you add some salmon roe be quite generous there we go beautiful salmon eggs and to finish it off taste little bit of soy sauce some cake ",

        "content": "hey guys we are doing at this video a little different today we're gonna go to little Koreatown we're gonna meet up with Fang and we're gonna grab some stuff for our giant sushi roll I know a lot of you have been wondering how do you get sushi grade salmon so we're gonna go over to Koreatown and we're gonna educate you guys a little bit on that I was just about to call saying to see where he was [Laughter] [Music] if you guys are wondering sang is like VIP grocery store so we don't have to worry about filming in here which is pretty sweet we actually have wristbands on so now we're coming to the fish park at the supermarket they have salmon when people wanna have sushi make sushi at home they really are afraid of the fish but most importantly if you can't smell it what you want to do is you want to be able to squeeze it and to see if it's flesh is firm wait dude is that all the camera we need or do we need more than I this you know this this is she rolls getting bigger and bigger as far as we're going do you think she's enough I think it was enough if we just I would want to love the bigger sure okay let's yeah let's get there most places you will be able to get this kind of frozen tuna alloy of BC white tuna or albacore tuna and you want to thaw it once you take it out of the freezer and it thaws you cannot be putting it back in the freezer to eat it again wrong so if there's another type of tuna that's really popular now to be consumed this sushi I mean you can find it in a lot of Asian supermarkets one of them is called in the snakes and like this one it's wood smoke wood smoke is used as a preservative kills off all the bacteria and stuff like that so when you see tuna sashimi for example a lot of restaurants use this if you want to just have small parties at home where you're cutting tuna sashimi this is it it's called tuna Saku you know it's been frozen why can you still eat it raw why can you eat it wrong yeah I mean all virtually all tunas come to you frozen if it's not wild-caught never eat it as sushi never see that's not sure okay we're debunking stuff right now there's no such thing as farmed salmon being bad for you to eat sushi we have to debunk the whole sushi great thing there you go okay so you heard of here first we're gonna finish shopping here we're gonna head home and we're gonna start making this roll so we just got back these are all the giveaway stuff congratulations to these winners thank you guys so much for participating there would be more giveaways to come but now that me and saying are back here we're gonna get into the sushi make what we're gonna do first okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna clean and soak the rice okay let's do it [Music] okay now smell it you want to smell it okay she's not fishy is it no no you're gonna get a little bit of fishy smoke this is fish yeah but but it's not you can tell right away and those your nose didn't crinkle which let's season it now [Music] so one thing I forgot to mention was the pinko so we're gonna have fry these up so you'll notice something 30 minutes later look at the rice beautiful pearly white and you see the way they've they've expanded absorb the water so it's ready to go [Music] what would you say that is a half an inch of water over the top of the Rytas yeah a little bit of character right now I've been watching a lot of wolfy Rob's and face banks and all of them and the one thing I find really funny is when they face not like was that thank you or was that not crunchy I don't know but let's get this video to a lot and I will do as so many more videos like this hey guys our race is done how long did that take a cup like 10 minutes 15 right that took about 15 minutes but what you need to do now is you need to let it set [Music] let's start preparing the sushi so what I'm doing them is once the rice is cooked is still hot so the spores are still open and at that point what you want to do is you want to put the sushi seasoning in so that it gives Maki to the rice as it cools and closes a source chopping motion is the best way don't do it too hard but want to break the grains but the slicing or chopping motion allows the Association season to get in between rice grains their rice hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm for this next ports I came up with an idea to make the giant sushi rolls so what we're gonna tape these together and hope to god it works hoping it does oh I see oh yeah okay we're gonna put the nori on top slightly on top of each other without work or am I dreaming [Music] see that's not thinking like kind of like that you know do you think you have enough raisin sure no no we do okay yeah I'm just not you might have to put is do you have it other ingredients you can throw in there oh yeah do we have enough stamina no right I knew I could have enough sanity I didn't know you were gonna make one the size of a carpet that's okay I'm gonna beat you up well we we don't have enough what we have enough salmon here but we don't have enough to fill it and make it look plump so we're gonna add some cucumber and oh no oh no no no have a problem that's hate I hold on doesn't happened to the other I don't think I'll happens the other ones I'm gonna put feats and purpose all over here now it's gonna be so good so I'm gonna sprinkle this all over right saying yep to put the cucumber down yeah all right with the salmon here ready to go yeah let's do it to roll it over and then the bottom part has to end up right around here okay so there is enough rice we should be able to do it this is the most crucial part yes so let's hold it some of the nori part that right there so now let's gently hang anything right yeah hold on no there's a little bit of a tear but watch what happens if you roll it over okay gently hold it what's your thing oh my god okay so we're trying to figure out how we're going to cut this you the stationmaster the hold my favorite Jesus I wanted to make it look at actually sushi grow bright guys published or pharmacist I see people literally with a huge sushi like the size of my body and it was just making so much ray smells like now like I want to do an actual role baby oh okay guys so just to give you a mental picture how big this is I think I've already given you one but this is my fish it's bigger than my face it's literally the size of my palm I have nothing biggest hands by pretty big we have a ginormous thing of soy sauce here we have some ginger and wasabi nice side down okay guys I hope you've enjoyed this video I love you so much and until next time y'all this guy's oh my god oh hey we sell a couple pieces lot so we're gonna try to giving some people to my Suzuki we're wondering if you wanted we made a giant sushi roll oh my god do you want [Laughter] ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "so to make the Panda sushi roll you're going to need some slices of sushi grade tuna and what you're going to want to cut is a couple slices of one centimeter thickness and a couple slices of 1/2 centimeter thickness why the different thicknesses because to draw the features of the Panda face you need different thicknesses to be able to make it look more realistic now once you're finished cutting your tuna sashimi you transfer it over into a small bowl and then you add some soya sauce you let it marinate for about half an hour to an hour don't go over an hour because it really starts to harden the tuna after a while in soy sauce and just leave it in the fridge to marinate so now what I'm going to make here is some green sushi rice and what I have is some cooked and seasoned sushi rice and I'm just going to mix in a little bit of wasabi masago you can buy this ready-made it's Caplan fish roe seasoned with wasabi and some seasoning it comes frozen it's very handy and then I'm going to add a little bit of chopped coriander now you gently mix it the idea here is to separate the sushi rice grains so the wasabi masago and the coriander can get in between the rice and then it looks nice and green make sure not to mush the sushi rice you really want to just separate it out and be very careful and don't squish any grains all right once you're done mixing this you keep to one side until you need it okay so what I have here is my marinated slices of tuna sashimi which I cut earlier and I'm going to prepare them into six different packages wrapped in nori of different thicknesses and different dimensions to make the different facial features of the Panda face for example I'm going to use the thick slices of tuna to make the to eye pieces and the to ear pieces and then I'm going to use a thin slices of tuna to make the nose and the mouth pieces now here I'm going to show you how to make one piece and then you and make all the rest using this information all right to make the tuna packages you simply slice the tuna into the right thickness for the parts you want and then you wrap it in half a sheet of nori you cut off any excess you don't need to wrap it completely and then you just keep them on one side until you get it later it's now to some of your pants with you what you do is take half sheet of nori and then you lay out a little bit of sushi rice in the middle just like so and then you take your thin piece okay this will be the mouth piece and you just lay it flat on top of that then you add a little bit more sushi rice very small amount if you overdo this you'll have a massive massive sushi roll so just lay it down take a little bit by a little bit okay and now you put a small piece which will be the nose piece okay and then again a little bit more sushi rice just enough to cover it up okay so here what I'm doing is I'm just adding a little bit more sushi rice on the sides so that when you roll it up you get a nice round Panda face you should always be thinking how this is going to turn out to be a circle once you roll it you want to be very gentle with the rice don't compress it don't over packet you just want to slightly fluff it out and really just get a nice and airy you don't want to have mushy squished compressed rice you want to just be loosely packed okay now you add the two large packages of tuna these will form the eyes of the Panda I'm just going to add a little bit more rice here and there now some more rice on top there we go again I'm just filling in a little bit of sushi rice here just wherever I fear that my needs more and you'll hear nearly done okay now to roll it you bring up one side and then bring up the other side and make sure they overlap and then slightly softly compress them together and then roll it round just to make sure it's perfectly circular now you can use a bamboo rolling mat as an aid here but it's really not necessary give it a try first without if you can't do it there's no shame take a bamboo rolling mat and try it with that instead just put it off to one side all right now you take two sheets of nori and you just glue them together by adding a little bit of cooked sushi rice in between and this will act as glue just like so and then you place this one on top it out perfect now you cover three-quarters of this larger nori sheet with the green sushi right hook read earlier again be very gentle with the sushi rice you really want to spread it out without over packing it it's more like fluffing it out you don't want to compress sushi rice now you take two chopsticks and just put them about where you think the ears will be and you just press them in and then take them out and then the grooves you just create it what you do is you add your last tuna packages which will make the ears and then on top of this with the right orientation so the eyes are on the bottom now you place your pre-made Panda face then you just wrap it around see it's perfect now if you need to add some more you could always just separate back add a little bit more rice and then reseal it okay so yeah I'm just going to see it now in case this isn't holding you can always add a little bit of rice in between the layer but as long as your rice is pretty fresh it should tighten up straight away the nori and it should be no problem okay so here comes the moment of truth time to cut it then you take a very sharp knife dip it in some water so the rice doesn't stick to it too much and it makes it easier to cut through rice now you want to do this preferably in a little motion as possible but when you need to you might need to sort through this and it's just because it's such a large roll and if the rice starts to bog it down so you just slice through it and voila there we go the Panda sushi roll done okay so you've reached in the video I hope this means you've enjoyed this video if that is true then somewhere down there you'll find a like

        "content": "the California sushi roll is one of the most basic roles to make once you learn how to make this the possibilities are endless all you need to make California rolls is rice seasoned vinegar avocado crabmeat cucumber ginger wasabi roasted sesame seeds soy sauce water and your seaweed wrappers or nori first you're gonna rinse the rice in cold water until the water is completely clear and then go ahead and put the rice in the rice cooker so after your rice is cooked you're gonna transfer it to a big bowl and season it with seasoned vinegar 2 tablespoons and just drizzle it over the rice now using a flat spoon you're just gonna fold the rice into each other and then break up some of those big pieces so as you're folding in your rice you also want to span it a little to bring it to a little bit above room temperature now that your rice is done we're ready to make sushi rolls you're gonna need a bamboo mat these can be easily found at your grocery store or a restaurant supply store now grab a piece of your nori seaweed wrapper and put it shiny side down make sure you have a bowl of water close by to dip your fingers in so that the rice doesn't stick you're gonna need this now get a little bit of rice and lay it on your sushi wrapper and start with just a couple tablespoons you can always add more and slowly spread it out and you're going to want to leave about an inch at the very top so that you can seal your roll at the very end now we get to add all the yummy ingredients I'm gonna put two slices of avocado next we're going to use crab we're using imitation this is the most popular way to make a California roll all right and then a couple slices of these julienned hothouse cucumbers and then almost like you're stealing an envelope dip your finger into the water and use it to seal the top part of your roll this is gonna help the rolls stay together now when you're ready to roll your sushi roll you want to start by grabbing the end of the seaweed wrapper closest to and try to tuck all those ingredients in there but use your mat to do all the work so make sure you're tucking under the last ingredient use your mat to slowly roll and kind of walk your fingers back as you're rolling once it's all the way rolled kind of hold it give it a little hug make sure it's firm and there's your California roll now when you set aside put it seem side down and then this is gonna help firm it up before we cut them so now that you've learned how to make a basic sushi roll we're gonna step it up a notch and do it inside out roll so using the same bamboo mat I've just covered it with plastic wrap go ahead and grab your seaweed wrapper shiny side down and this time you're actually gonna put the rice all the way to the edge and then we're gonna sprinkle it with roasted sesame seeds this gives that roll just a little bit of crunch and makes it look good - very carefully you're gonna flip this over and then creamy avocado then your crab and then just a couple strips of the cucumber we're gonna seal the top again a little bit of water just like you're sealing an envelope and then you're gonna roll it the same way and then I actually like to sprinkle just a little bit more sesame seeds alright so now we're gonna cut the sushi rolls you want to make sure you have a really sharp knife and you want to make sure that you let the knife do the work for you sometimes it's good to run water over your knife to kind of help it so try to get right in the middle and then cut it right in half and then these two end pieces one more time and then these two and you want to face them up see how you can see that yummy crab the creamy avocado and the crunchy cucumber looks so good and with the inside-out rolls same technique there you have it the California sushi roll is delicious decadent and so fun to make I think this would be really fun to do a girls night in have a sushi making party thanks so much for watching I'm Brandi and I'll see you next time for another taste of young sugar TV ",

        "content": "welcome back to yet another sushi roll video now this week I'm going to show you guys something pretty amazing the mosaic sushi roll evolution this is basically the second evolution of the mosaic sushi roll you will probably remember the initial mosaic sushi roll if you haven't seen it just click on the picture now and you'll get to see that video now let's not wait anymore let's go straight into it but it's not very important that you find a very small thin cucumber being is the bigger the cucumber piece the bigger the end piece of sushi gonna be so you have to make sure it's tiny and very thin now you want to cut it just the length of half a sheet of nori so fully stretches across and now what you want to do is just simply slice it in half okay then slice the halves into quarters but don't slice it directly into course for example this one I want to make it slightly smaller because I find it too big so what I'm gonna do is just find the middle and then just cut just to one side and just to the other side making smaller quarters and then there'll be a little excess piece which I'll throw away or diffuse or something else okay now I just flip these over and just even them out okay perfect and yeah so what you want to do in the air is just make smaller quarters the sushi roll isn't too big that's two of them done okay now the same with this find the middle and just trim it to one side okay the bigger these corners are will dictate how big your sushiro is and you want to be able to eat in one go so it's best to make these a lot smaller than they actually are okay so here are my four quarters and these are now going to make the corners of my sushi roll now just check that you've done the correct cuts just assemble your cue card back together and it should be like a smaller cucumber I guess now you've got much smaller cucumber than before and you can't find these naturally this side so just perfectly what you want to do is just take half of your sheet of nori one of them and add 60 grams of cooked white sushi rice now if you don't know how to make this a linkages peel on top left corner which will take you to my website where you can know how to make the perfect sushi rice you just spread it out then you start at one end and just make sure you cover it very the very thin lay don't worry you won't reach the end but that's the entire idea here just place your cucumber down and now you simply roll it okay now when it reaches the end just trim off whatever excess there is because you don't want to have it so going around the spiral so just let's ease off that's fine that's perfect you find that okay this you can just discard this time take the pink sushi rice this is about 80 grams don't take all of it just take about 90% of it leave a little bit there and then you just start to spread it up again [Music] okay so a very nice thin layer now if you wanna know how to make this pink sushi rice press on the link which is peel on top left corner and I'll take you to a video of how to make things with your eyes okay perfect now you take your prior made roll and you put it inside this one okay and now you roll it round again now see here perfect it meets rice - rice and then you just keep rolling and you see it now here where there's little flap what you want to just take a couple little pieces of rice and just squish them here and I'll act as glue and it'll close up without any problems perfect now for this to one side all right so now what you want to do just simply slice the roll in half taking into consideration where the cucumbers are already cut in half so you don't want to cut them in again so now that that's cut in half just cut it into quarters going through the same line [Music] perfect and perfect if you want to use the same knife as I'm using in this video I have made a video about the knives I use and you can click on the link which disappear on the top left corner to go there alright so just put them to one side your quarters perfect and now what you want to do is you want to take two half sheets of nori and just simply glue them together by using a couple little pieces of sweet rice so you just take sushi rice and you squish it across one side like so and then you just put them overlapping each other and that works as glue correct now place your quarters one here and the other one the opposite way around so that there's a nice v-shape in between two okay in this VHS add a little bit of carrot sauce you can learn how to make this on the video link which is a on top left corner and just put very little bit if you put too much it will ease out the sides I really don't want that to happen alright so you just lay a piece of sashimi grade tuna right there like so and then you add a piece of salmon just on one of the faces the same size and then opposite piece of salmon on the opposite side just like so perfect and then the last piece of tuna on top now that you doll slot in together and it should make a beautiful pattern like so okay now you just add a little bit of your carrot ginger sauce again on top remember not too much otherwise it uses out the sides okay and then you add your remaining quarter pieces one here and the other one on the opposite side remember cucumber is on the outside then you hold it together and you just flip it over [Music] and then you just keep flipping it over until there's no more space okay now when you come to the end what you do is you add a couple more pieces of rice just to glue it together perfect now to cut the sushi roll what you want to do is you want to have a nice damp cloth just dampen the knife up it slightly wet the edge all right then you simply just cut quickly a very thin piece so that there's a nice fine edge there we go beautiful now this you can throw away or eat whatever you want this is excess and now in between cuts just clean off the knife and I'm very quickly slice through blue that beautiful pun it's just it's a beauty I I think my work here is done I hope you guys enjoy making this thank you for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it if you want to see more of my videos then please subscribe to my channel by clicking on the button on the top left corner and if you want to see more my videos right now then you can click on the button on the right to see all my other videos I hope you guys enjoy them and yes I am sitting on top of a mountain right now why you asked because you should share this video right this second because I'm on a mountain that's why and just answer any questions that down there is Marbella and this is the south coast of Spain awesome place to live recommend it coming on vacation great place that's all folks till next week ",

        "content": "that's the second time I draw my camera [Music] that's nice you hope you guys are all doing super well today I have a huge bang for you guys we are going to be doing a giant candy sushi roll so get ready smack that thumbs up because if you don't the sushi rolls not going to work out it's going to break and it's going to be a huge disaster so Herodians I need your good luck smash that thumbs up I would like to first mention that if you're on a diet Sam do not try this DIY because the amount of calories and sugar in this video is going to be staggeringly high so just take it easy people who love sushi you guys are going to love this and people who don't love sushi you're also going to love this because we ain't using fish we're using all candy or like just sweets this is pretty much what we'll be using for the sushi roll we have black premium rolled vanilla fondant it comes in these giant blue bags it's like four pounds of it next up to the right of the sushi we're going to replace that with rice krispies we got that we got our marshmallows we're going to make just regular rice krispies but we're going to flatten it out and put it on top of the black fondant hopefully it doesn't harden too quick and we can still like mold it when we're rolling the sushi and right here all the toppings we're actually going to put inside the sushi so the first thing we have is white decorating icing and this is going to be your philadelphia cream cheese for the philly rolls I think these were called cherry twists these are going to be our salmon next up we have these banana gummy thingamajig is that going to be our avocado and this is just leftover M&amp;Ms for my chocolate pinata watch the video right here it's just going to make it more colorful we're melting marshmallows in a pot with butter for our rice krispies I'm going to start on the seaweed roll so I'm going to take this fondant out of the bag and hopefully roll it across the table I think one was definitely enough I'm laying the wax paper down on the table we're going to grab our icing sugar and then this is going to be like our flour so it doesn't stick but it here so I've just been spreading the icing sugar out on the wax paper I'm going to keep my hands like this so I don't stick on to the black fondant right there you just want to treat this as if it's like bread and you're rolling out the bread on the flour you know now we're taking our rolling pin okay that did not work you're actually supposed to like knead it for a while basically just mess around with it in your hands and then it'll be more like pliable and easier to work with this is going to take a while but look at that that looks like C we could be guys don't screenshot this this looks really wrong we're quickly realizing that one tub was not enough so thank God we have two tubs so this is literally the longest part of the video we have one tub completely cleaned out which gives us four big things of fondant and now I have to open up the second tub can you hurry up I'm just kidding I can in pick it easy is a joke second four pound fondant coming out using my fist whoa oh this is a nice technique - oh yeah you're like getting fisted roll roll use the forearm roll it out you want to do this my hands are so tired he was leading to the next one oh we got a nice you Shi thing going oh yeah oh oh yeah oh yeah roll that rule ha ha ha 12 seconds later I just been rolling that out to the last like 20 minutes we're finally done the entire table length now we just have to trim the edges so it's all clean and then we can add the rice krispies aka the sushi rice got my handy dandy butter knife we might just eyeball it and kind of just trim it ourselves I take that piece out and then we want this one to be a flat line so hey I ate that satisfying oh oh no we're good cut that edge out make sure it's clean we'll keep this we'll put this aside in case we need extra yeah oh that's nice good look at that guys I think I did a pretty good job six and a half hours later they just helped me make the rice right here so we're going to lay it in the middle we're just going to leave a little piece of black here to start the roll oh my god thankfully we have some people coming over tonight that is going to help us eat this I'm going to try to roll out this rice to the edge of the seaweed roll as much as possible remember guys turning these tough videos you've got to stay focused and you gotta keep hustling good to see you I think I'm going to have to pet more the seaweed out there's no way I can get it all the way to the edge that's as much as I can climb out guys my hands are shaking we're waiting for the neck I'd say two and a half batches of rice and then we can move on to our toppings run Alan Lopez we just found a life hack we're skipping this out we're just putting the rice krispy straight onto the seaweed and we're going to mold it into shape from here I love this because it saves a lot of time and time is money money is I don't know where I'm going with this or how are you doing oh no oh no no don't worry when I flatten it out it'll look like this keep going you're doing a really good job I'm getting the nice camera angle look at this [Music] that's the second time I drop my camera holy proteans I have a challenge for you guys I let the secret message in this video if you found it comment down below I'm not telling you guys where it is look at all that Rice Krispies goodness snap crackle and pop thank God we have wax paper under it because if we didn't there's no way we can grab this up without it sticking on the table we are first adding the salmon I'm going to eat one go to home grooms and then Bay right now is adding that Philadelphia Cream Cheese aka white frosting on how we're because I'm Jerry twist we got four rows of topping so far we're gonna have to add this because this is looking a little plain right now I might even start looking around for more toppings to put because at first I was trying to keep it to the proper like sushi toppings but now I'm just saying Yolo I want it to be really colorful just use your imagination guys just pretend like this is like caviar or fish eggs or something like that they just came in clutch with the frosting let me get a nice with that chocolate sprinkle oh yeah that's that's fine switch it up to these ball ones oh yeah that's beautiful it is looking so colorful good job David so we've added a ton of the candy this is what it looks like so far [Music] what's up stop I think we're ready to roll this bad boy Romina truth I've never rolled sushi in my life what do I do oh go crack yo make sure you take off the last paper while you're at it dad yeah how are we going to eat it if there's wax paper on it without figuring oh my god we have package we have practice we want to fix it we don't want it to break you might don't crack on me oh we're nearing the end drill Rhodri Wow this sushi rolls can you see the layers in there is it showing enough now we had to cut it down the middle Rick it's caring no no no no no he's coming in I'm saving it ooh I see the guac all right ready I'm gonna split it in half oh that looks dope Oh check that out so here is a final product of our candy sushi I think it turned out amazing I'm gonna try to cut myself a nice slice you wanna know we did a fantastic job you know people hate sushi when there's way too much right to fish ratio luckily here we have a that looks like a lot of action I don't think anyone would eat that sushi if it had that much luckily it looks like there's a lot of seaweed so here we go I'm going to cut myself a nice light of this oh my god I'm starving what the hell was the guac coming out candy sushi taste that mmm mmm Wow a fire feels like you just dumped a bag of sugar in my mouth mmm good job on the rice your mouth it's black mom are you sure ah I'm so good this is really holding the fridge I'm going to save it for tonight

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "okay welcome back to another cooking video I'm chef Devaux today I'm going to teach you guys how to make the Valentine sushi roll now what you're going to eat first is some spicy tuna tartare to make this you're going to need to use some tuna that you have from offcuts say for making tuna sashimi which I'm going to teach you how to make in this video later on now you take the tuna sashimi off cuts and then you chop them up okay so once you've chopped it up just transfer it over to a bowl and then you add a spoon of mayo now you might want to clean up a little bit keep it nice and tidy I find is the biggest battle in the kitchen just to keep everything clean and our spoon of masago this is captain season fish roe a little squirt of Sriracha hot sauce this one's the best one with a rooster on it it's the original one and the best taste on all the other ones just don't even compare compare to this one okay and now you mix it all right so just mix it gently and don't over mix it once it's done just leave it in the fridge until your news okay one last thing to prep before we start making the sushi roll we need some pink mail and to make this is very simple we're just going to use some mayo and we're going to mix it with a natural colorant like for example raspberry juice in this case you can also use different things like strawberry juice or cherry juice anything else or you could use some synthetic colorants it's your choice I just like to use a little battle started a little bit salivating okay so here I'm just going to make some mail with some raspberry juice let's start by adding a little bit of raspberry juice seeing how it is after I mix it then add a little bit more and a little bit more to get the right color here all we're looking for is the color we just want to set it equal to be pink just for this purpose there's no taste regarde or ice there you go pink mayo now what you want to do is take a ziploc bag and you grab one of the corners use it look back and then you pull the bag around your hand now leaving a crevice here where you can fill in with mail and then you just scoop it in because later we're going to use this as a piping bag so you just want to cut the edge off there nice now you just invert it and as you can see all my pink moves in one of the corners and then later when I cut the tip off I can use as a piping bag to place it wherever I need to so just keep this in the fridge until you require it okay so now you place a bamboo rolling mat inside a ziplock bag and then place half a sheet of nori on top then take 120 grams of cooked sushi rice that's 4 ounces let's read over your nori now if you don't have make sure she writes a linkages peel top left corner screen which will take you to a resource I've made of how to make sushi rice then flip over your sheet of nori now add your tuna tartare and two slices of avocado just like so now to roll it just bring up the back end and pull it over or then you press release and then go forwards and then press again release move forward and press one more time and then release and that is your sushi roll all right now what you want to do is you want to take your rolling mat and squeeze it into a heart shape so half a heart shape all right so you press down with your palms in with your fingers and this creates half a heart shape okay all right so what I have here is a beautiful piece of sushi grade tuna specifically the albacore species if you know what sushi grade fish is then click on the link on the top left corner is free right now you'll find out more about it so 2 cups actually me what you want to do is you want to cut through the muscle fibers of the tuna and to do this you cut up 90 degrees from the fat lines which you see running through your steak now what this does is it cuts through all the fibers and then it's a much more softer texture of tuna it reads falls apart in your mouth okay the technique here is pretty simple just press your fingers softly against the stake to keep it in place then it slides in one drag in a single direction and this creates a very beautiful grain cut it's very important to have a very very very sharp knife if you want to get the same knife as I'm using here you can get the same knife by clicking on the link on the top left corner the screen extremely sharp and it does the job without any effort all right so now I take my slices of Schumi I just cut and I'm just going to layer them across my sushi roll don't worry if it goes over just trim it down later just make sure it goes all the way across okay perfect now I'm just going to press them on and then I'm just going to trim off any excess on both sides all right now before I cut it I'm just going to add a piece of cling film onto it and fix it on with a bamboo mat just to keep everything in place so nothing gets out of shape when I cut it we'll make the cutting easier too then just wait your knife slightly in some water first I'm going to cut the edges off all right so now I'm going to do is I'm going to cut it in half and then I'm going to cut the halves into quarters and the quarters into eighths make sure to wipe down your blade on wet rhaggy between cuts makes it much more easier to cut after cutting just refirm it back into shape in case you moved it with bamboo rolling mat and then heylia clink them off now you can take them apart and you'll see that two of these create a heart shape like this it's not a garnish your hearts what I go here is silky egg yolks I showed how to make this in a different video so click on the link on the top left corner if you haven't seen that video now they're really airy and light and you just sprinkle them on top to cover up the entire thing it's arrived it falls off on the on the wooden plate that's supposed to happen because I'm going to move them later anyway so once you've covered it with your silky egg yolks you take your pink mail which you made earlier and you cut the tip of the bag off and then you just squeeze it out and just follow the border of your heart once you're done with decorating them you can start plating up just take a big plate and then you just take a knife and slide it underneath and lift them up and place them on the plate they add some pickled ginger just in a pile then you are the wasabi leaf and ask not least a little carrot butterfly now you can learn how to make this card butterfly by clicking on link on the top left corner screen it's another YouTube video I made once upon time but if that's it that's your heart sushi Rock Valentine's Day done I'm about to hit 50,000 subscribers sometime within the next week or something and it's truly a humbling I mean I can't imagine that many people in

        "content": "welcome back to my channel in this week's episode I'm going to show you guys how to make the seared tuna sushi roll to season the tooter add some pepper on to one side and then some crushed sesame seeds now you can crush these seeds with a mortar and pestle the idea here is only the season the side that's going to be in contact with the pan because I already want to sear that on one side you want to start off by adding a little bit of coconut oil into the pan coconut oil is great to cook with you can find some on my store alright so just wait till it gets nice and hot add a little bit of sesame seed oil for taste so here we go lay away from you that's what you want to hear that nice sitting style you just want to give it not long maybe with two minutes tops just look at the side of the tuna you want to be about one third to half way cooked alright so when you take it out the pan you just want to have it crispy side up this will make sure the heat doesn't get trapped in between the board and the fish cooking the rest of the tuna now what you're looking for is nice crispy brown layer on top with sesame seeds and pepper and crispy tuna all right so now to assemble the rolls first let's cut the tuna you want to cut into strips about two-fifths of an inch one centimeter wide all right so now place a bamboo rolling mat on the cutting board add a sheet of nori put the rough side up it's the shiny side of Mosher you can see it in the video so now take your cooked sushi rice 150 grams which is about 5 ounces and spread it out over your nori you're looking to cover about 70 to 80 percent of the seaweed paper just spread it out don't press it down just fluff it out don't want to compress the rice we want to be nice and airy and light if you want to know more about how to cook sushi rice a link will appear now on the left hand side now that you've covered your nori sheet add a little bit of spinach just cover the center of the rice more less leave a little bit of the edges to close it so the rice meets the rice now you add some cold sprouts these are really good for you and it's really advisable to start incorporating sprouts of any kind into your diet and this is a great way to do it inside sushi rolls and salads your choice it's really good for you now I just see a tuna slices and now roll the sushi roll just close it up perfect and I'll just push forward and on the top there we go now what you want to do is just find the seal here and just leave it resting on it so that the rice lets out the moisture which goes into the seaweed paper and the seaweed paper will tighten up when it gets wet and this make sure the sushi roll is completely typing close just leave it for about 30 seconds to a minute just go make another sushi roll and then come back and cut this one there's no need to cut it straight away because otherwise that you have a little flappy piece of seaweed paper which isn't properly sealed okay now cut your sushi roll what you want to do is just have your plate slightly wet on the edge so the rice doesn't stick to the blade too much and you simply cut off your end pieces okay all right so now I just simply cut your roll in half and then cut the halves into quarters and then the quarters into eighths and this will ensure that you have eight pieces of sushi and that is how you make the seared tuna Maki roll beautiful done see you thank you for watching this sushi how-to video now if you want to use the same products as I use in my videos like this cutting board or these knives then click here now and it will take you to my store on my website which has a lot of sushi related products like sushi grade fish and ingredients the basic ingredients and sources also utensils and machines that I would use make sushi and I think you should be using to make sushi also thank you for watching and goodbye ",

        "content": "hey you guys it's Christina and today we are going to be making fully raw rainbow sushi rolls these are so colorful so nutritious so delicious and so much fun to eat these are raw vegan low-fat gluten-free and scrumdiddlyumptious seriously though eating these is like eating the rainbow this is all of nature's goodness wrapped up into one bite don't these look amazing for those of you who missed it I just announced my first fully raw book tour coming up within the next few months I'm so excited I'm going to be visiting cities nationwide and the list is still being updated so keep an eye out for some new cities popping up check out the video I shared a few days ago discussing event details and you can sign up on my website at pulley rod comback slash events and I will add that link below for you for this recipe you only really need a knife and a cutting board but if you have a blender or a food processor it will cut the prep time in half for you you will need some raw nori sheets and a sushi roller to help you roll out the sushi I am so excited to make this recipe with you they are so easy to make and share are you ready let's get started first thing is first chop up all of your rainbow ingredients that you want to use in your sushi there's no right or wrong here it's whatever you desire this recipe along with all of the ingredients in this video will be shared on my website at fully robbed comm for the rice of the sushi I'm going to be using a shredded or finely chopped jicama purple cauliflower and yellow cauliflower you can dice these with a knife or use a food processor to get the very fine grainy consistency then I have also chopped up some rainbow bell peppers beef cucumber carrot purple cabbage red onion mango and avocado to make your sushi grab a nori sheet and place it smooth side down grab some jicama sprinkle it on and press it onto your nori then do the same with your yellow cauliflower and your purple cauliflower when you have all three of these layered and press down onto your nori they will look like a tri-colored rainbow make sure to leave a little room around the edges of the nori for later now is the really fun part grab some cucumber and lay it on top add some bell peppers sprinkle on some shredded beets add some shredded carrots some purple cabbage red onion mango and avocado to top it off now this is going to be too much for one role or nori so what I do is I begin to wrap it up and tighten it with my sushi roller then I add another nori sheet on top and make it into one giant sushi roll by wetting the edges with some water then connecting them after this I roll up the whole thing using my sushi roller and form it into one giant sushi roll when your roll is fully tight grab at the sharpest knife you can find and start slicing out your rolls about an inch at a time and then start placing these onto a plate how awesome do these look when ready put these to the side and now let's make our sesame ginger lemon dressing in your Vitamix add a half a cup of raw nama shoyu three to four tablespoons of raw unhold sesame seeds 1 small thumb of ginger and a squirt of fresh lemon juice blend this up until it becomes completely smooth and then pour it into a small dipping bowl for your sushi for those of you interested in my sweet pink sushi dressing I will add that recipe below in the description and also on my website at fully Roth com ladies and gentlemen I present these absolutely gorgeous fully raw rainbow sushi rolls these are stunning these are delicious these are raw vegan incredibly healthy and

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hey guys my name is Brian skinny from secrets of sushi comm and in this video I'm going to show you guys how to make the caterpillar roll the caterpillar roll is a fairly common sushi roll found on sushi restaurants all across the United States it's pretty iconic because it has thinly sliced avocado that's kind of formed around the top of the roll and they usually do like a really neat plate presentation where it actually looks like a caterpillar on your plate now normally this roll is made with unagi on the inside and cucumber but seeing as how freshwater eel is not only endangered species list in two different countries and probably soon-to-be many more countries for this tutorial I'm actually going to be using tempura fried shrimp instead of unagi the tempura fried shrimp are going to be more sustainably sourced and more economic for your wallet than freshwater eels going to be so let's get started for this tutorial I have just a few pieces of cut cucumber and avocado a few pieces of tempura fried shrimp my bowl of sushi rice a small bottle of eel sauce and my cellophane wrapped in Maki soon I've also got a few half cut sheets of nori and my bowl of water first thing I want to do is get our half cut sheet of nori and lay it horizontally across our Maki sir I'm going to make sure that the rough textured side is facing up and the smooth side is facing down when I get your hands slightly wet so a nice and glossy but not quite dripping with water and we're gonna get a handful of rice and we want to slowly spread that rice to all four edges you want to make sure that the rice is about two to three grains deep and that you can still see a little bit of the nori peeking out from underneath the rice intermittently so after our rice is spread across our half cut sheet of nori you want to grab the two corners we gently flip it over and then we want to do is set all of our ingredients along the centerline of the nori so the first thing I'm going to do is grab a few pieces of cucumber and then a few pieces of our tempura shrimp and as you can see our temperature imp doesn't quite go all the way to the edges so what I'm going to do is take the shrimp and slice it diagonally go ahead and do that for each one and we can set them back along the centerline and just slightly stagger them a little bit and what this will do is it's going to stretch out that shrimp make sure they'll meet from end to end and also make it a little bit more consistent along the center of the ruler now since we only have the two ingredients for the inside of this roll let me go ahead and roll it up so you want to put your thumbs underneath the Maki soo and you want to use your remaining fingers on the other side of the ingredients to kind of hold it in place we're going to gently roll the edge of our rice mat that's closest to us over the top of the ingredients and keep rolling it until it meets the exposed part of the nori now at this point we're going to drape the democracy back over and we're going to give the role a gentle squeeze making sure that we're not squeezing down but in fact squeezing back towards us it's going to give a gentle squeeze back towards us and what this is going to do is compress all of those ingredients together making sure there's not a lot of air inside and also making sure this edge of the nori is tucked in instead of being squished out so afterwards we can just finish the rowing process out by giving one more roll over and another gentle squeeze this time pressing a little bit more down and then we have it now what I like to do is do a quick roll tightening technique where I hold on to the bottom of the Maki see with my left hand drape the maka see over the roll with my right hand and spread my fingers up out and then just apply some downward pressure and roll that back towards me just like that now we're going to get to the fun part of thinly slicing that avocado to drink over the top of our roll so what you want to do is carefully slice your avocado in half and you can twist the two halves to open up your avocado and then I want you guys to hand peel your avocado all right now we're going to try to slice this avocado as thinly as possible so once you guys to do is make a posh ape with your hand and I want you to set the wrist on the cutting board and gently drape your fingers over the avocado and you're going to actually let the your finger touch the knife as you're dragging the knife across the cutting board we're going to do is trying to make a couple of thin slices and we want to continue to do this until I've cut the entire oven kado now that avocado is nice and thinly sliced but once you guys to do is take one hand and gently push the avocado from one side we're going to kind of stagger these pieces out and what our goal here is to try to make sure that the avocado is about the same length as the roll itself now to transfer the avocado to the roll I always take my knife and very carefully slide it underneath the avocado and use the knife itself to pick it up and then I'm going to set the knife on top of my roll and gently put my hand on top of the avocado and then just slowly hold the knife out from underneath making sure the avocado balances on top of the roll next we're going to get a piece of cellophane film and drape it over the top make sure that your piece of cellophane is wide enough that whenever you slice the roll the edges of the cellophane are going to be far enough away so that you won't actually cut through it this will make it a lot easier to peel this little thing off once the rolls been cut into individual pieces then we're going to get a Maki soon preferably one that isn't wrapped in cellophane because the one that is wrapped in cellophane is going to pull this piece of cellophane up off of it we're going to take this unwrapped Maki soup and use the flat side of the bamboo pieces and drape that over the top of the roll and we're just going to gently press down very very gently to make sure that the avocado is wrapping around the roll just like that I should have a con does not hang off the end is too much and now we're going to slice the roll using a wet rag go ahead and get your knife slightly wet we're going to start in the center of the roll using long slicing motions and really letting the weight of the knife carry it from the top of the roll down to the cutting board and cut that roll in half cut those halves into quarters and then cut those quarters into eighths all right and as you can see the piece of cellophane is end up looking pretty gnarly when we're done I'm just going to slowly peel that off make sure you get all the pieces of cellophane off of there and you can take your wrap Maki soon place it over the top again just give it a gentle squeeze so put everything back in the same shape it was before we cut the roll now one of the more iconic parts about the caterpillar roll is how it looks on the plate so I want to show you guys real quick the plating technique that most chefs use to make it actually look like it's a caterpillar crawling on plate I like to use relatively large rectangular plates and nice and flat and what I do is get my hands just ever so slightly wet I'm going to take four pieces or half the roll and I'm going to kind of curve them just a little bit it's almost like you're trying to make a fourth of a circle or maybe a third of a circle I'm going to pick those four pieces up place them onto a plate and you're going to take the other four pieces and curve them in the opposite direction then you can pick up those pieces up and also set on the plate and kind of play around with the spacing a little bit until you find a curve that you particularly like and then finally we're going to get a bottle of eel sauce we're just going to drizzle it right over the top and finally we're going to finish off our caterpillar roll with a little bit of toasted sesame seeds thank you guys so much for watching this video if you have any questions about how to make the caterpillar roll feel free to drop me a line in the comments section below and for more

        "original_title": "How to Make Vegetable Sushi at Home",
        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hi there Pamela sulfon from the kitchen matters vlog and today I'd like to show you how to make vegetable sushi it can be done at home so I'm gonna start with some sushi rice I'm gonna make it from scratch you need a sticky rice for this to work otherwise the rice will just kind of fall apart in the roll so a sushi rice labeled like this is great if you insist on doing something with brown rice you can use a short grain brown rice combined with a sweet brown rice and the sweet rice will have more starch and it will make everything nice and sticky so you can also go to your local sushi place and just buy the rice from them and then make what you want at home the important thing is to rinse the rice first so I'm using a fine mesh sieve which has very very small holes just enough for the water to permeate but not enough for the rice to go through like a colander would and you just want the water to run clear once you you know have rinsed the rice so you can still see it's a bit cloudy I usually do this for about 30 seconds or so and just drain it a little bit gonna shake some of that excess water out and then I'm going to put it into this is about one and a half quarts this pot it's just a cup of rice so we don't need anything bigger than this and I'm gonna add to this one and a quarter cups of water just follow the package directions most of them say between one and a quarter cups and one and a half cups of water but you're not gonna use the same 1 to 2 cup ratio that you normally would with rice so just keep that in mind so I'm gonna add 1 and a quarter cup of water I'm gonna bring this to a boil over high heat I'm gonna lower it all the way down to low keep it covered and I'm gonna cook this for 15 minutes and then it'll be ready to go okay the sushi rice is done now I checked on it after 15 minutes and the water was absorbed I like to let it sit for a few minutes but what I'm gonna do now is take some rice vinegar that I had mixed with a little bit of sugar and a little bit of salt and I warmed up the vinegar so that the sugar and the salt would dissolve if you put it into cold vinegar and you just whisk it it's not gonna dissolve well you could also use something like agave I'm not a big you know fan of it but for a couple of teaspoons or something it's not really a big deal and that is already you know in liquid form so you wouldn't have to warm up your vinegar so we're gonna pour this over our rice and we're just gonna stir it in okay make it all nice and well incorporated and then I'm gonna pour this into a bowl and just keep stirring it just to cool it down a little bit as well and I'm gonna use this rice then to make our sushi so I'm gonna do some veggie sushi today but you can really do whatever you want if you can find good quality fish or you can even do something like smoked salmon or cook salmon or cook shrimp it's the same technique so you can really you know do whatever you want you can also do things that are more fun like do roasted sweet potato slices in here or some sprouts or you know who knows what anything goes really okay so I'm gonna just set this off to the side and I'm gonna prep my vegetables for the sushi and I have some really beautiful Reed avocados today these are amazing they're in season right now they're not in season for very long but I'm gonna use these because I think that the flesh is really nice and creamy and I love the flavor and I'm gonna use some cucumber so these are my son's favorite for sushi so I'm gonna use these today you can julienne things or you can cut them into like logs whichever you want but I just wanted to show you my setup over here because you want to be pretty organized before you get started so I have some roasted nori so you want to look for roasted sheets of nori like this and I got this just at a kitchen supply store by me but Whole Foods has that you can order them online but they're not difficult to find so I'm using this one and I also have a bowl with water in it and that's for my hands so that my hands don't stick to the rice once I put it in my hands and then I have a towel just to get my hands clean and I like to sprinkle the rice with something called gomathy oh and this is a Japanese macrobiotic condiment it's sesame seeds and sea salt I just think it gives it really good flavor this one happens to also have seaweed in it my kids love it I sprinkle it on top of like green bowls all the time but we happen to really like it in sushi too so I'll do a little sprinkle of this as well okay so let's prep our vegetables with the cucumber I just want to get it so that it's the same size as our sheets of nori so I think I'll cut it right about here and just trim the end and I like to do these kind of strips but again if you wanted to julienne it that's cool too so just like that so I'll show you how to do small sushi rolls that are cut and then I'll show you how to do the big rolls which are a lot easier okay I also have here which you kind of need to do the small rolls and this is just a bamboo mat they're very inexpensive they're like a dollar you can find them online I've even seen them in some supermarkets and obviously at like a Japanese grocery store you can find them but they're really inexpensive I always put a ziplock bag over it just to keep the mat from getting like rice inside of it and then I can just you know either wash the plastic or I can just you know use a different one all right so here's um one sheet of nori and this is going to be for a big roll okay if I'm doing small rolls I'm gonna have to cut the nori so let's first start by dipping my fingers into the water and then grab some rice still a tad warm fact I'll try and cool it off a little bit more like this now you don't want to cover the nori with like a thick layer of rice okay you could actually you're better off if you have if you can see some of the nori underneath as opposed to you know massive whiteout here because it'll be more difficult to roll if you have too much rice so less is better truthfully all right looks good wet my fingertips spread the rice around like that and you want to have a border at the base not on the edges so much but at the base you want to have a border so that you can roll it but you know do go all the way to the ends so you can see I'm not covering every little square centimeter of the nori there that looks good okay so then I like to sprinkle you don't have to do this if you don't want to but you know again we like it sprinkle it with a little of that and then I'm gonna do some cucumber and then let's cut some avocado I like to wait till the last minute to cut the avocado because I don't want it to get brown and we'll put a couple of pieces of avocado in here and this is for what I like I said a big roll so it's cut a little edge of this hmm this is a gorgeous avocado look at that I mean does that just make your day or what makes my day okay so let's cut this into like some strips just like that beautiful and we'll just put a little wedge right there and I'm gonna try and sneak this little guy in here too okay all right now we're gonna roll it up so you don't really need the mat for the big roll so you're just gonna kind of fold over towards the midline and then kind of tuck in the nori and then just keep rolling tuck and roll tuck and roll and you see why you need some space there because sometimes the rice gets pushed a little and then the moisture from the rice should help to close the nori and seal it if you're having a hard time you can just wet your fingertips and run it across the nori that isn't covered with rice and then you know it should seal but this is sealing fine so here's your big roll I like to dip the knife in just a tiny little bit let the water run down a bit and then you can cut this into pieces so you want to saw not smush and it's good to have a sharp knife to do this okay look at that we just need sushi how about that so good huh so this is great for a lunchbox I don't make it too much anymore because I don't have that much time in the morning but you could make them the night before I don't love the rice refrigerated overnight but these are so fun to bring to a party or if you have kids over appetizers like super fun okay so I'd like to now show you how to do a smaller role because there is a bit of a different technique with that one okay so you're gonna take your sheet of nori fold it in half or you can use a scissor fold it the opposite direction so you get a nice perfect break and we're gonna do the same thing right not all the way just enough and you can't put too much filling so you kind of have to decide rice and cucumber or rice and avocado unless you have everything really really thin and small all right that looks good wait my hand just important that two little towel is because the rice drives me crazy and let's just put one strip of cucumber right there a little gum Osseo voila and take your mat to help you okay so it will help you curl over and then once you've got it curled over then you can sort of like tuck it a little bit okay and then crimp it like that just go right in don't be afraid and then keep rolling okay and that's how you do a small one you really need the mat and then you can just cut this like you do the other ones okay so and then you got the little baby's so cute okay that's how you roll sushi ",

        "content": "[Music] sushi was actually one of the first things that ever learned how to make for some reason I decided to go from bacon egg and cheese is which is one of the easiest things in the world to sushi which is arguably one of the hardest things in the world and a lot of people kind of called me not some 15 16 years old I took I started teaching myself and then I took a course and I found that it really wasn't that challenging yes you can spend you know 15 20 years mastering rice and you can do the whole jiro Dreams of Sushi experience but the truth is it doesn't have to be that scary what I found making sushi is not only is it super fun we save a lot of money making yourself you can buy the fish you only need to use fish when I was a kid I was making like barbecue bacon chicken rolls and weird stuff and people were calling me crazy and wondering why this white boy was trying to make sushi but now let's become more open widely accepted that anyone can make sushi so I'm going to show you guys a beginner's guide version of how to make awesome sushi and just to give them in the very giving spirit one person is going to win an awesome dope brand-new knife which you can see in the links below I'm going to send this to one person all you have to do is like this video and share it on one social media in a Twitter Instagram Facebook whatever it is you can win a brand new knife to cut your own sushi or anything you want with all right let's just switch over to little voiceover making sushi right so first I make my little seasoning it's just some rice vinegar sugar and salt in a three-part rice vinegar two part sugar one part salt and then you just kind of get that hot and look at everything just melt you're good to go now I have short grain rice right here and this is a trick you need the Japanese short grain rice to make this work and what's amazing about this is it's like so you see the grain just is small you know that's why I show grain right right right so what I'm doing now is I'm just washing it and I'm going to wash it until the water is clear what you're going to see is every time I kind of move the rice around gonna release the starch and if there's too much starch it will get too sticky NUI and gooey so I wash it in water kind of massage it in there and I keep straining out the water until the water is eventually clear so washing it straining it washing extraneous many times you need to until the water is either extremely clear or almost all the way clear it's not perfect that's all good but look how clear the water got you'd see my granules a little little right now put that in the pot and we're doing one to one ratio one cup of water to one cup of rice and once that comes to a boil you cover it and I'm using a towel just to give it an extra extra good seal I'm covering it and cooking it for exactly ten minutes on a low simmer and once it's done it's going to look beautiful the rice shouldn't be too cooked if it's too cooked and overcooked it gets super mushy you want those granules as separate from each other as possible and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to mix it and mix it and mix it and add in that seasoning if you don't want to add it all you can add some and and taste it it's going to make it sweet and just give it that sushi rights flavor what I'm doing is I'm folding over and I'm come cutting I don't want to match my rice up too much and this is a what's cool about this right here see the slow motion so I'm actually Fanning it ideally if you have another person that's even better you're mixing it and you're Fanning at the same time because you want the rice to cool very quickly otherwise if it doesn't cool quickly it's going to get super mushy so you want to cool it and season it too same time freaking genius and put over some wet paper towel let that chill so you're ready to take another very confusing element of sushi is what the hell is going on with so sabi and where do you get it what do you do with it this is wasabi powder there are many different kinds typically this would be able sabi root if you get it fresh and they grind it up and they make this fresh facade beats spicy it kind of opens up your nose and does this whole thing but the truth is most people have never actually eaten wasabi and you're probably wondering why because you've had sushi so many times but most bosavi is not actually real asabi you look at the ingredients usually it's horseradish and some other stuff give the sabi is expensive very hard to find this one says ingredients no artificial color it's got wasabi powder horseradish mustard tapioca starch and wasabi 2% wasabi so they're kind of like really cutting it and giving you a little wasabi but not really but it's better than the one that's nola sabi so I guys so basically this with the powder you just kind of rehydrate it out a little bit water just a little bit we start to mix because the goal is you know you know how it is like you get it and it's kind of a nice little so the ball thing probably added even too much water I'm kind of being lazy but that's no problem I'm going to show you what you can do if you add too much water actually I think it makes a little easier to add too much water first and then go in with your little powder and kind of girls like making a little dough like that pretty dang easy but it's funny doing this video my gathers so many things regardless of like me making this perfectly right or not like there are so many elements of making sushi people can be very very confused like you know the pickled ginger how do you do that wasabi this is how you pick it so a little grateful to be doing this video and sharing with you guys and there's so many resources online and people that are master sushi chefs that when you want to take those next steps but sometimes I can be a little intimidating so I wanted to give you a good beginner's guide so you don't get eliminated and look now we have a little sort of saw wasabi powder all right just for a little quick pickle of the ginger I take some ginger that's peeled and I'm adding in some rice vinegar a little bit of salt some water and a little just pinch of sugar and then I'm just mandal eating this you can also cut it up you're super fine the sooner the better and then once that comes to a boil that mixture I'm just going to let it cool down and once it cools just pour it over my ginger and let it sit you got pickled ginger probably one of those confusing things for people in there making sushi it's figuring out the whole fish situation when it comes to special fish situation when it comes to fish there's a lot of confusion like how do you find sushi grade fish can I use this fish in this market so I need to get the freshest fish in the world there's a lot of different information out there some of the stuff I'll tell you guys though per fish to be properly sushi fish actually when they first catch it they flash fry it so you might say mi t\u00edo fish that's fresh that's the best right it's fresh never frozen the truth is for like the FDA or whoever makes the regulations you're supposed to flash fry the fish super cold and that kills off the bacteria so that's really the only like standard that I've heard for sushi grade fish a lot of places just call it sushi grade called super fresh and it's not necessarily a real standard so of course and you're eating raw fish you want to be careful that's the first thing make sure the source you're going to is good reliable source make sure we smell it not smell anything we're like that salmon right there it's just clean fresh delicious so I'm working with a couple different fishes today some of the most popular one salmon you'll see the sushi a lot tuna is yellowfin tuna it's actually a really good quality tuna but it's frozen so it's like yes I could have found fresh tuna but if you can't find fresh tuna that sushi grade you can get a good frozen one it remember it was going to be frozen anyway and the fresh one is probably actually frozen they just thought it out with tricking you essentially eel is unagi I love eel roll typically with eel you'll find it already like broiled cooked in this barbecued sauce you all you have to do is heat that up you can buy a whole eel but it's regular it's fine like yield that's kind of uncooked and frozen this is a little fish roe which like the fish egg I just thought it'd be fun I found it in the freezer section does it be fun to cook with and then the crab so typically with crab if you get a California roll the imitation crab you know that stuff it looks kind of like crab that's not real crab yes you can buy that if you really want to make the California but I actually got some frozen crabs his real crab I find it obviously work so much better but again the biggest thing this fish is just making sure you get the freshest best fish you can remember fresh can be frozen and though it's confusing talk to the go-to fishmonger talk to them say hey what's a great fish for sushi I'll need something raw but the end of the day trust your intuition smell it there's any weird smell at all if it doesn't smell just like the ocean fresh like you'll know it seems the fish like if it's bad you'll know it's bad that's just kind of like a bit like why should say I gave it smells bad and you're some people like what I supposed to smell like I smelled it you know you smell what supposed to smell like but I find that if you smell it and you're like oh like why you put my nose up here and just kind of chill and feel good versus like something's off don't risk it you throw it out or if it's just a little off you know you can cook it but that's a little bit about fish and I'm going to show you this cool knife I guess [Music] are you ready for this so so I've never had a sushi knife like this actually I'm left-handed so it only works for left-handed people to the other side now then with this salmon cut the skin on so I'm actually just going to take about this much that's slicing I've always wanted to be able to do that so to help get the skin off there's a number of ways that I find that if you sort of just cut down and get to the skin and then just kind of turn your knife and then just very lightly go along the bottom very very gently okay I want to take a few minutes to kind of show you a little bit more about cutting of the fish it all depends on like what you're doing and how you want get it into your roll right so for example of the salmon let's say I wanted to do like some really nice sushi which when you think of sushi it's not necessarily the sushi in the roll sushi just means rice right with some fish so the sushi roll is a different thing but a lot of times with sushi you'll see if you just do like will say flashy me first so see me is just straight sushi so if I just want to so see me I was literally just go like that and have like these nice piece oh my god so good really nice salmon so I could do like a little sashimi platter but for sushi you know I might want to cut it a little bit thinner very light very gentle you don't want to push on the fish just kind of well it's like butter I mean this thing cuts just like butter and then I can make my little sushi well so I'm just gonna actually slice up some of the fish right now and then I'll start rolling I'll just make a little bit easier now for like let's say a salmon roll you know I might want to get these long thin strips so maybe I go like this and cut thinner strips like that and then I can actually place them in my sushi which I'll show you guys in a minute this path might seem a little bit simpler and it is but it's also really important because there's a couple things you should know when you're trying to make those like matchstick sushi things they get a lot you got your you to summer in half and just kind of scoop out the speed because if you try to cut it with the seeds it gets very kind of wet and weird and moist and all gooey so we don't want that so what I can do is just kind of now that I have it like here I can just take these nice long slices and kind of kind of get the carrot or the cucumber like except a little bit and you can get to do it just like that and then sort of take these and cut them in half communities are nice like sometimes they love to smaller pieces I kind of like the long ones they fit you know really well in there but should a few you can do these little smaller guys you just kind of play around with how the cucumber wants to be cut keep them long like I said or can I cut them in half it's really cool cuz they do and you're having fun there's no one right way to do anything ever to make anyone believe that carrot same deal just carry one scoop out the core I mean you could because it can be a little bit more bitter I technically shouldn't be using this knife just kind of cut these strips and then when I have these trips I like to kind of take down sort of do yeah really thin you can use a mandolin if you want let's talk a lot of the most important parts of making the sushi roll now again sushi does not refer to sushi with TV typically but when people think of sushi they do so this is toasted roasted seaweeds and basically just the weeds on the date so it's good to get a roast you can get unroasted and kind of toasted over a fire if you want but this is the series here whoa man down seaweed on the ground so this is seaweed right here and you'll see there's a shiny side and not quite a shiny side and usually the way to tell is not quite as shown the inside has these like really long thin strips they both have the straight lines going this way so these really thin strips so this is the outside you put you want to put the rice on the not as shiny side and even though it seems like you want to roll it this way this is the way the lines are you actually want to roll it this way you're putting the rice which way rolling it up and when you make the sushi all right it's so incredible it really did not take all that months of lots of little steps but when you got the rice from the fish you're pretty much ready to go so I got my seaweed here and what I used to do is make the mistake where I cover this whole thing of rice I'd wrap it up and I had this frickin sushi that was just had way too much bang rice and like it was just a mouthful to eat and I'd pretend I enjoyed it but it was just a horrible boil so what I do here is got my rice and I forgot if I told you this but I take my rice and I actually keep like a wet paper towel over that just kind of help to keep it really nice and moist and so key ingredient it's just water which is a splash of rice vinegar and what's happen might get my fingers in there it's going to make it so the rice is not stick to my hand because it's very sticky right so I just take a little bit of rice and very simply you don't want like I used to push it down like eh like squash it into here look very simple you can keep dipping your hand so I can get it so you guys can kind of see to get the rice and just kind of very like light be and gently sort of break it break it up kind of cover it just it doesn't have to be like fully covered again you're sort of like giving it like a nice enough cover and leave a lip right there that's the key element show you guys why and so it's just like a really simple role now one thing I forgot is I'm losing my mind do this is this now this is to roll your sushi a lot of times we'll see is I'll cover it in plastic wrap and the reason they do that is that way it doesn't keep getting dirty every time you roll new rolls which is very helpful and it also helps if you want to do a reverse roll but I'm not going to do that right now no big deal so kind of to get it if you don't have one of these there are ways to work around it but they're so cheap and easy it's like you get a $4 so boom simple take a couple of carrot strips and kind of just lay them out so they're nice and long you don't want to like go overboard on the sushi and kind of put them the key element here is sort of putting them towards the back not all the way in the back but kind of giving them a little space because you're going to be rolling this over and there's some cool things you need to know about this when you actually make this let me show you I kind of just had this in the fridge rack to keep it nice and fresh I'm going to take just a couple of these really thin sam and strips just like them and if I need to like if something feels a little too thick I can cut it but it's going to keep it like that now here's the trick the first roll this this is the money shot right here zoom in for you the very first roll you want this to go over to this end piece right here right where the righteous you want it to go all the way over so I kind of lift this all up make sure it goes right over it it's probic and then I'm just pulling I'm pulling this back and pulling this forward it's creating this really nice tight seal you can see how it's all covered right and you're never like it's not like I'm going like this now it doesn't make sense it's just right over and in the very end piece where that little stuff is left it'll kind of void some water then just like that you can then at this point you can kind of roll it up and just sort of tighten it and make sure it's nice and tight that's the key is you want this sushi as tight as possible but it's really what you have is that simple it takes a couple tries but I've shown people how to roll sushi in five minutes in the first couple slides it looks silly but you know eventually you get it it's really satisfying rewarding and then look boom now there's one of the tricks that I want to show you guys for this night for any nice when you're cutting as you can see all the rice get stuck on that so what I like to do anytime I'm cutting my sushi is get a bowl with ice water and a towel right and what I'm essentially doing is I'm taking my knife and every time I cut doesn't to be every single cut but I'm basically just keeping this blade really really cool and wet and you don't want to this lady to get wet for too long if that's a rough but then when I cut boom see now it's not going to stick I'm getting awesome little sushi slices Wow we did it guys we did it that's really simple Seminole Coast I've actually got here's the pickled ginger I mean it could definitely sit for a couple days or a day but I'm just you know a couple hours of still going to get a really nice pickle on it and the reason it's not pink is because when they make it pink it's actually a coloring so this is you see that you're like that's not the sushi ginger but this is just much more natural got my little bit soggy there add a little ginger boom boom and this is just like the first start of this I got some soy sauce - you can't forget the soy sauce so fresh ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "welcome to Hoya healthy organic inspired Asian food and cooking I'm Diane yang Kirk and today we're going to be making healthy and delicious black rice sushi the first is a dairy-free Philly roll the second is a tuna and avocado roll and the third is a vegetable roll let's make some sushi so the first thing that we have to do is turn this price into sushi right now generally speaking if you didn't notice in sushi rice there's some vinegars or sugars it's a little bit of salt so instead of actually mixing that together itself we're going to shortcut and cheat a little bit today so we're going to start with a inorganic seasoned vinegar so this already has all those ingredients mixed into it we're going to add an eighth of a cup to three cups of black glutinous rice there's a little bit of a technique in infusing these seasoned rice vinegar with the black rice so it looks like it says Hornet on a sea and then you're going to flip it and the reason why you want to do that is so that you keep the rice fluffy see and fly place lights I don't know when you're making white rice usually you are steaming one part white rice with one part water when you're making black rice you'd want to add a little bit more water okay one and a half to almost double not exactly level but almost double the part because the rice is harder and it will break down when you add your own water to it and just let it steam just a little bit longer you want to be fluffy you want it to be a little sticky so you need Ulrich's water you have to make sure your knives are sharp we're going to prep our vegetables now taking the ends off the asparagus so all of it is tender next for our vegetable roll I'm going to do some beautiful slices of this red bell pepper right down the middle and I take out the bits we don't want I thought anyone could be some nice long slices I always cut my peppers from the inside out because outside here it gets a little slippery and you're nice and slide not good cucumber going to take the ends off the cucumber slice it inside and these are English or Persian cucumbers they're very crispy and very cool where you actually take out this pencil just because it's a little less firm it has written one juice we want it to be really crispy next to the rice and the fish we're going to slice this and how we're going to also slice it again into beautiful pieces I've only ever found the in cream cheese in a tub so if I want to work with it in a way that makes it really easy to put into the sushi roll then I find that in a similar way to piping when you are making some frosting or anything like that by putting it into a plastic bag and it's squeezing out of the end it makes it a lot easier so my vegan cream cheese is so now the refrigerator just for a little bit just so that it's a little bit softer you don't want to know for two now I'm going to take the top off of the zip lock I'm going to put the de refrigerator and so I'm ready to use it at this point but when I'm ready to use it I'm going to snip off the end but don't do it before you put in the refrigerator because it might lead I have a filet of sushi-grade salmon as well as some sushi grade tuna don't just get frozen tuna person salmon make sure when you go and see your butcher what's the seafood butcher called fish the local fisherman your thing would die when you go see him or her make sure you ask for sashimi grade fish I'm just going to slice this in half so I have two pieces and the reason why I'm slicing it in half is so that I can have a nice strip that's about the size of what we're going to use in our sushi you're going against the grain if you see how the grain is going one way you want to make sure you go and make an ex pleat other way so the first piece here I'm just going to slice off because that's not really long enough I'm just going to perfect yeah all right so once again against the grain but I'm going to slice it and huh this is beautiful the grain is the plan so I'm going to go opposite cross he's happy and we're about to start rolling our sushi when you have the seaweed paper there is a shiny side and also a rough side you want to make sure that the shiny side is down because the rough side is what the right will stick to so if you remember rough and right if you settle health or no that helps me the square root seaweed is a little bit too large so we're going to cut it there are some preparations perforations I can't prefer conference there are preparations on the seaweed which you can cut along because I'm doing four ingredients I'm going to need a little bit extra seaweed so I'm going to make sure that my seaweed is not the full square but a little bit shorter so I have plenty of space but not too issue eight we have a damp towel right over here for us to clean or knives on in between cuts first thing you want to do is have a little bit of warm water on the side and the water also should have a little bit of rice wine vinegar and we're just going to have a little bit of a hand wash and that's so that my hand still excuse me sweetie right Delphis eyes and my palm we're using black rice today instead of the regular white sticky rice that you'll see at a Japanese restaurant very often because it is healthier for you and it'll leave the top come inch or so went out to sheet right right they're building their gift YUM for the avocado I'll use a butter knife and after I have my avocado juice some nice slices I love avocado so eyes will not skimp on that next I'm going to pipe my vegan cream cheese I had cut a hole off the bottom of the bag and it makes it very easy to have my cream cheese rather than pulling out of the tub and trying to throw it on my salmon doesn't that look great it's time to fold with the help of the bamboo mat underneath I'm just going to bring this up and around and once this top gets the bottom over here I'm going to give it a little bit of a squeeze and I bring the bamboo back and I finished rolling and you do that one more time so we have a beautifully rolled roll we'll make sure your knife is damp toughest and tough and sip it around if you want thicker sushi cut it in the third thinner maybe into a quarter but I'm going to make it nice in this we're going to do surge you know you can see the salmon and the avocado the cream cheese and the black side on to the tuna avocado roll I've decided to add a couple of extra things to it just to mess it up a little bit confused ombre and some masago for color my hands are wet with matter right there are extra antioxidants and vitamins in the black glutinous rice and also this rice is known to not have amylase which will help you keep your insulin levels down it will spike your blood sugar all kinds of really racing beautiful tuna and Pavo asado always pops in my mouth and I feel like I forget a masago pop in my mouth hours after hug sheet and then I'll cut out once again we're going to roll take the seaweed paper and bring it over so that it touches and puts on top and use them out and you go a little bit of exclude justice and then another little please and just so we're sure that seaweed sticks I'm going to add just a little bit of moisture our right doesn't warm anymore which helps to release some moisture to that b-roll space our student avocado roll has now turned into a tuna cucumber avocado the fact oh oh I don't know what that's called but it's good make sure my knife is wet in half so we have to anniversary rolls done if you're making a vegetable roll and there's someone who doesn't like fish make sure you clean your knife and also get a new towel don't clean my hand that's no rolls are great they're kind of guilt-free don't you think delicious cucumber because it's a veggie roll I'm going to make sure that there is a little extra I love the red bell pepper in a vegetable roll because it reminds me of salmon and then some avocado if you want you could always add some carrot or vegetable you want wrap it up wrap it off just so it's not completely guiltless just a little bit of extra indulgence my favorite vegan cream cheese Wow so excited we're gonna go for that roll one more time and touch make sure it's all in there and squeeze and roll it again and please okay it's not sticking this reminds me of when I'm making dumplings we'll do that on another episode what figures okay this is our last roll in our left head and after this previous you see and there you have it healthy and delicious black rice sushi made three ways but you can do at home now a master sushi chef might not say that my technique is perfect but in the end it tastes good so with that I have to say oh yeah the square root CP C speed seafood seaweeds I'm going to call make sure that they are ready for the rolls and we will then be on a roll that sound so funny oh I don't have a bag chop them up get them ready for when we are doing our rolls and we'll be on a roll I don't know I can't say it we're chopping up our vegetables if you enjoyed this episode of Koya food and cooking please like this video and share it with your friends

        "content": "what's going on everybody welcome back to part two a beginner's guide to making sushi the best sushi series in the history of the world except for all the other ones that are better but you know I just do the best that I can manage Oh doing it I did shave all my hair off I needed to change you're probably missing like three feet shorter right now but so part of before I get into the actual sushi guide if you haven't seen part one you can click the link below there's also a card thing that will pop up they got rid of annotations on YouTube apparently but click the link below to go to part one you're gonna know how to make the rice how to pick fish head make wasabi all like the basic basic stuff how to roll sushi this part I'm going to get into some more specific roles we're doing spicy tuna we're doing trying to think well so we got we get that California style roll a couple other little slippity surprises going on in there like other stuff you know but before I get into that I just want to address a couple things I realized that I don't say I made mistakes cuz I don't believe in mistakes but I did some things that I had never done before people commented so I figured I'd address the comments one of the big comments was that I was using the sushi knife wrong now that I completely get I wasn't like thinking I never used a sushi knife I just went out and bought them before the video is excited to use it but the whole point of the sushi knife is when you're it's so long I think that's a that's like a dwell ban chair that you're taking these slices I was kind of doing the back and forth you know saw motion but when you should be slicing fish it should be like a long you know just like one long motion same with the sushi so no sawing another one some people just suggested with the fish like of course I talked about the smell sometimes the fish looks kind of slimy that's no good otherwise I've actually felt really good about the sushi that I made there a couple of the comments but I don't remember them I thought I saved them anyhow so for part two we're about to rock this thing I'm going to be doing another giveaway another knife giveaway I announce the winner just so you guys know anytime we do a giveaway we don't do an announce the winner video because we're not like a daily vlog so we're just putting out videos when we are inspired to videos so I did not do an announce the winner video but everyone wins like if you go I mean not everyone will lose everyone wins but people that win they know about it so if you did win congratulations on that last knife win this week we're going to be doing a giveaway that is actually going to be a sushi starter kit to get some rice and mats and things just to make sushi I'm going to make this one worldwide so anyone worldwide all you have to do is comment below tell me your favorite sushi roll what you love about sushi and then just send an email to brother's green treats at gmail.com treat so I'll put a link below to that as well after further ado let's get on to sushi part 2 so probably the easiest and also most gratifying thing that you can do in making sushi is making the spicy mayo it's literally two ingredients and it's so good so this may or might look kind of silly to you is called cutie mayo it's a Japanese Mayo instead of regular vinegar they use like rice vinegar and a couple other things you can't find it you can make homemade Mayo with rice vinegar or just add a little bit of rice vinegar to your Mayo it's going to taste a little bit different but still pretty much same and that's just a Rasha and what I love to do with sushi place is because I always love the spicy tuna even though it's not like really a real sushi roll that's more like an Americanized thing what I like to do to get a side of spicy mayo and this becomes just my hotdog like my go-to hot sauce if you want to make spicy tuna then all you have to do is just chop up your tuna really fine toss it in here and you were set to go so frickin good I'll show you how to do a little spicy tuna so just cut this up really nice and rough cut it up some people like their spicy tuna like or chunky I kind of like it a little bit more let's take mouth taste but a little bit of body but mostly just like I can cut up if there's some pieces like that they're like really feeling tough to take that out that is like minting this up let's move on to the role that made me appreciate fresh fish although I will say I don't think I knew it had fresh fish in it [Music] let's move on to the role that made me appreciate fresh fish I will say that when I first got it I didn't really have fresh fish probably why I liked it and you know this is spicy tuna so I just got my mayo in the bowl a chopped up tuna thanks so you can adjust the ratios to what you like but pretty simple literally just mix it up some people will like add maybe some scallions or something with some color cool but kind of texture then you have your little spicy tuna so I'll show you guys now and make a looks like tuna roll [Music] just for the logic final taken sesame seeds you know what I like to do for a sushi rolling party is just get out all your ingredients have your friends bring over stuff or just get it all set out get the fishes get the toppings and everyone just gets to roll their own roles and it's less about like getting it perfect and more just about having fun with your friends and trying new creations and it kind of breaks down this whole experience with like she's not accessible because all of a sudden you're there with your friends you can try any role it's not like though it's gonna cost me 20 bucks to get this role I might not like it's like no you give it a try if you don't like it you can take it apart you have or whatever anyhow same deal here goes in I'm going to add some cucumber just to cuke it up give it a little bit of that cream cuz you know we like that green all those green and then just try to get that over this one I may have gone a little too far but listen up so good make like listen if there's a little bit of leakage no big deal but you really want that to be tight tight and you're always you're never rolling this mat over you're always pulling this up so the thing is rolling inside of there boom it's so quick to kind of tighten it up a little bit the end of the roll just like that another one down another day another way alright so let's just make it a little bit of a platter this is going to be put out the rice paper I'll do some more rice papers in a minute but what they do is they kind of take in their hand get their hand nice and wet against it unzip and he should have make this ball all right kind of like a little ball right here and the trick is you take you two fingers and kind of push down now again my rice I know I know it's not the best rice but still going to work kind of push down form around and as I put some little wasabi under there but then you just find a good piece and sort of lay it over and there's yes it's like a you know more third way to cut em shorter but just lay that over like that you have a little sushi Wow look at that - Street magic serving it to a friend oh my god yeah oh just like that these little sushi right there again doesn't have to be perfect if you wanna learn like all the perfect ways by all means you can do that you can find videos I got sushi this is just again a beginner's fricking guy beautiful chicken sushi platter mmm telling about this stuff fresh clean this up sushi 20-story my first the first girlfriend I ever had in high school she had a taste for the finer things and I did she was wanting to go to sushi good relieve order so we'd go out told her my like one roll I was like I only like the crazy rolls I didn't like raw fish the time I get at the shrimp tempura deep fry but all kinds of stuff on it by the mail and then after I would sneak away and get like a slice of pizza because I wanted to be cool but eventually I started to really appreciate sushi now I love like a good fresh fish and like how to root yield but I get if you don't like sushi I don't like raw fish it's like you'll get there just keep trying it get some good fresh stuff now some people are going to inevitably drawn to the inside-out roll so I'm going to show you how to do that even though I don't make it very often so the same day you start the same on me is a full sheet of sushi for this one you don't have to you know depends on how big you want the sushi all right and I just mix that out I'm about to make a big mistake but we'll just see what happens that mistake is that I do not have my saran wrap covering this wrapper so it might get rice on it but am I making one doing kind of lazy like I don't want to do that take it spend a whole day cooking and then you're like yeah I'm just all too lazy to do something that I would take me about eight seconds but you know so it's going to get more sushi on this and this time and now I'm just showing you guys now you how to make the basic I'm just showing some fun ways sort of like slice it up just a little bit starting again crazy created yeah so now here's the trick you take this you flip it over and now you're filling it up here that's how a California roll they have avocado they have this sort of imitation crab a little more advanced but form you know not hard so I'm going to take my actual fresh crab in this one and boom Shaka boom just like so I feel like it might have a little fish roe in there so let's fish roll it up why not cool like that maybe some carrot just add a little bit of structure to our floor and then same deal now it's a little more tricky but a little bit bigger no big deal though I just go over and yeah but here's the reason why yeah here's the reason why you would use that so it doesn't stick so we're gonna pretend it didn't stick and just kind of get creative make it tight boom and then we end up with this guy so you can see like I have this little extra here if I want to I can cut that off but it doesn't matter so kind of look good kind of make sure it's nice and tight right let's go right to the rice like you know still worked but the rice is now kind of stuff on this thing which I'll just at the clean off will be a little so I can't say this is perfect because of my way of doing it still actually really beautiful it's the thing like you know you gotta appreciate the sushi with how you make it and be grateful for that look at that oh yeah see boom incredible now I'm just using with my method again I've got my wet towel here very cold just wiping it down with every slice especially the one like this would I think it's a little more potentially fragile [Music] and it will hand keep little wasabi I'm sure I'm just what mmm no I'm Malcolm ",
