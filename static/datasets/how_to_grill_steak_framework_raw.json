        "content": "everybody my name is Matt bronzy I'm the executive chef here at El Gaucho in Seattle and welcome to grilling 101 now there's a lot of theories out there about what to do and what not to do when you're grilling a steak today we're gonna throw a lot of those in the garbage and everything you need to know about grilling the perfect steak starts right now so the first segment we're going to talk about is heat regulation seems to be the most common cause of charred steaks and overcook steaks whether you're using a gas grill or a charcoal grill it's all the same so let's say for instance you're using a gas grill what were you gonna want to do is if there's three knobs down on the bottom I want to take the knob on the far left and I want you to crank that up all the way because that's where you're gonna do your searing in the middle knob I want you to put that on medium heat because that's where you're going to kind of cook the steak without charring it and on the far right now you're gonna turn it basically almost on low that's where you're gonna kind of bake the steak another important part to grilling is making sure you have a clean and seasoned grill what we do just want to make sure that you get all the carbon off take a dip brush a good scrape and also what you're gonna want to do next is gonna want to take in oil rag basically a rag that you don't want to keep something that's just strictly for the grill because it will get dirty so this rag has just a little bit of oil we're just gonna grease up the grill nice and good there we go now the grill is completely seasoned next what we're gonna want to do is seasoning the steaks what we have here is a filet Certified Angus beef from Neyman ranch filet what we're gonna do is just make sure that the Flay is nice and coated with steak seasoning this is our El Gaucho steak seasoning you could buy this at Metropolitan market amazon.com or here at the restaurant what you want to do is put down the presentation side first and again I'm starting on the left side because I want to get that sear because my heat is higher on the left side so there's a theory out there that you're you know when you're putting the grill or a steak on the grill or a flattop of whatever that you're actually searing in the juices and that's not necessarily true they're actually caramelizing at the top and you're searing basically kind of on the flavor of instead of sealing in the juices of mistake depending on the heating your grill you're gonna want to wait about two to three minutes per side like I said it all just depends on your Heat and how high your heat is but if you're not if you're unsure you just go ahead and take a peek it looks like we're about there you just want to get a good carmelization on that stick is that carmelization is flavor so there's a theory out there that you're only supposed to turn a steak once or limit the amount of times return the steak that theory is not necessarily true because you can flip it as many times as you want we've done lots of tests and the results are the basically the same what I'm gonna do here now that I get a good char on the other side as you can see so I'm facing the steaks facing this way I'm gonna go ahead and turn it to two o'clock it's before we were at 10 o'clock now I'm going to turn out to 2 that's why I'm gonna get my diamond marks on that so it's been about a couple minutes we're gonna flip this over see we got some really nice grill marks there and what we're gonna want to do is once we get our good sear on it we're gonna kind of bring that into the middle to the lower heat so if you enjoy a charged steak and a great way to do that is you can either use lamb fat what we use here at the restaurant or you can use bacon or butter or even a foil will be fine we're gonna do we're gonna put the steak in the hottest part so this would be on your left side of your grill you need to take some of this fat and it's gonna let it let it seep into the the flames and eventually flame up so what this does the fat drips down into the grill and it creates the the flame to shoot up and then it'll char perfectly charger steak so usually if you'd like a really good charge steak I'd leave it there for probably about two minutes three minutes let it char up really good the only way and the best way to make sure that your steak is where you want it to be is with the thermometer unless you cook a lot of steaks sometimes you just get the feel for it and sometimes you're able to touch it and kind of know where it's at but I think the thermometer is your best insurance policy you need to make sure that you don't over cook your steak once again my name is Matt bronzy I'm the executive chef here at El Gaucho in Seattle I hope you learned a lot from this grilling lesson and we hope to see you at the restaurant ",

        "content": "hey this is Tristan at hip cooks in West Los Angeles and today we're going to talk about steak cooking a steak there are so many cuts to the cow and it's sometimes difficult to choose what to cook I tend to like t-bone steak and sirloin they have a nice amount of fat in them they have a lot of flavor and the best cut is going to be with the bone-in so if you can't get the bone in there keep it in it adds the flavor and it's something to gnaw on when you're done yummy YUM so here I have a t-bone steak and it gets its name cuz it kind of has a t in it can see it's a seasoned this steak I'm just gonna use basic salt and pepper and a little bit of garlic for garlic just take a clove and cut some chunks of the garlic I think one will be enough for this size couple chunks and I will cut little slits into the steak around the bone maybe one or two in the middle where you see some of the marbling and push in some of these little bits to flavor the meat my grandpa taught me this one adds nice flavor you can see that this steak is about about an inch thick which is fine the thickness of your meat will depend on how long you cook it so we are going to be cooking this for about five minutes aside in a high Brailler if you have a thicker steak you will want to cook it for six to seven minutes per side okay so a little salt just a little pinch will do on each side and a little bit of pepper pepper to really depending on how much you want okay so we did the first side now let's go to the second side again just cut some holes in the steak along the bone and maybe one in the middle of the marbling and find those little pockets and put in some garlic okay and a little more salt pepper so that steaks ready to go this is a quick preparation the pan the broiling pan is in the oven I've set the broiler to high and I've set the broiling pan on the middle rack so it's been preheated so when I throw this on I should get a good sizzle follow me over to the oven that's the sound we want okay so about four minutes per side so in four minutes I'll flip it over okay the steak is ready to take out as Evan all right so what I did I left the steak in there for four minutes on one side and after four minutes I flipped it check the temperature it's running at 120 just where I want it because I want a medium-rare steak and I'll cover it for about five minutes and while it's covered the temperature will rise to probably 125 which is the perfect temperature so in total this is about six minutes of cooking and again it really depends on the thickness of your steak so don't just read the cookbook and say okay four minutes the side after you flip it test the temperature to make sure that it doesn't get overcooked one last thing with steak you can certainly do this in a skillet the reason I didn't is because I don't like my house smelling like steak nor do I want splattery fat all over my oven so this is kind of a cleaner way to do it but either way the cooking process is the same for approximately four minutes aside and flip let it sit for five minutes and it's ready to serve enjoy your steak thanks for watching if there any other dishes you'd like to see me prepare please send us an email at request at Mahalo calm and in the meantime check out our other videos ",

        "content": "what are you - this your boy Sonny this is the first episode of sunny side-up um and today when we do a state so today we're going to be doing state guys and the specific sake we have is called flat iron now flat iron comes from the cow's abdomen section and so it has a really good nice beefy flavor and it's not very fatty and the way you want to cook this steak is you want to cook it medium wire to medium no more than the medium because if you do it'll get tough but if you cook it like that this steak I'm telling you guys I preferred over filet mignon and I know it sounds crazy but it's that good okay guys so now we're going to actually season our meat and this is coarse salt it has a little more texture than regular salt and don't be shy with the seasonings this is a thick thick cut of beef um and so do not do not be liberal with your salt and pepper on it um so yeah just try to get it everywhere everywhere you can and now we're just going to flip it over just like that and actually press the salt in a little bit because you want it to stay on there get into the meat and it'll create a nice crust when we when we take it out to grill it you just want to turn our beef like that and you see these little things right here you can remove that um you don't have to it doesn't really make that much of a difference but if you want you can remove it this out it's very small amount but if there's large amounts of this silver skin you just want to take that off and so we're just going to salt both sides and now we're just going to put some pepperoni you can use black pepper you can use pink pepper and actually picking peppers not really peppers this is the type of berries but like I said do not be liberal with your pepper for salt and you see I'm not washing my hands after I touch this Romney you guys want to wash your hands I'm going to watch everything that I've touched but just be careful not to cross contaminate anything with the beef or anything else in the kitchen because you can get sick like that and I'm in pepper on the other side press it in and now we're ready to grill our meat just ok so now the next step is actually grilling our steak and what you're what you're going to need for this is you're going to need a really hot grill like we have here and this extra really nice grill and it's been preheating ours is about at 600 degrees so that's probably the temperature you want around there you want to go to higher and you could go a little lower or not too much and so what we're going to do now is we have our steak here and I'm going to use a fork to put it on and then the thongs to take it off because I want to use two different things so I don't cross-contaminate so I'm just gonna stick it in the beef and we want to hear a sizzle as we put it down and that's perfect you hear that sizzle I think you can hear it all the way over there can't you and so what we're going to do now is we're just going to cover this puppy up we'll turn the fire down here and we're going to let that grill without opening it for about nine minutes per side it's a big piece of meat and we wanted to kick it to to a medium and remember after we're done grilling this we're going to let it sit for at least 10 minutes so it's going to continue to cook so that the juices seatback in and we end up with a juicy steak okay guys it's been about nine minutes on one side so now we're ready to flip our steak we're going to take our fork and now put it down on the other side that's perfect you see we got those nice grill marks on each side now we're going to close this and let it go for another nine minutes exactly how it was you can check on it maybe once or twice but try not to keep this open keep it closed so uh so it stays nice and hot in there hey guys so it hasn't been exactly nine minutes but because of the texture of the state I can pretty much tell you that it's done it's been about five to six minutes on the second time so so it's all about um it's all about just really seeing really seeing what your stake is doing what your food is doing you know touching I'm touching and it's pretty firm so another ten minutes of letting it cook by itself and the steak should be perfectly medium guys our steak has been resting for ten minutes all the juices has seeped back into the meat so now when we cut it it won't come running out now we're ready to cut okay guys so before we cut the steak really important to remember this steak if you don't cut it against the grain which means that you're cutting it against the the way the meat grain runs along the meat your it's going to be more tough because of the the fibers in there so the grain on this state runs this way so we're going to do is we're going to start here and we're going to cut it this way diagonally the whole steak so let's get cutting and then in the middle might be a little more medium-rare but that's how you want to eat these steaks because if not if you cook it any more in the medium it's going to be a tough fibrous steak so you can see we cut our meat and look at that it's perfectly medium perfectly medium it's pink all the way through and that's exactly what we want so now the moment of truth guys you know I gotta try this I've been salivating the whole time and now it's the verdict hmm Wow boys and girls this is liquid gold oh wait so guys thanks for watching our first video there's Flatiron steak on the grill for you and if you liked it please subscribe we'll have the recipe up soon and as always remember the best eggs are the ones that are sunny-side up I'm sunny god bless the United State ",

        "content": "say folks in this video I am fixing to show you how to grill the perfect steak you heard me right the perfect steak I'm going to show you how to buy it what to look for how to prep it to get it where we want it and how to cook it to the exact doneness that you want so stick around you're going to enjoy this one [Music] it is a beautiful day I mean there ain't even no wind blowing in southwest and the good Lord blessed us cuz we got nine tenths of an inch of rain on Saturday the first we've had since October so thank you Lord but today we're going to talk about grilling that perfect steak now where does that start that starts with you buying the perfect steak that you want to cook there are three choices that you have to make select choice and prime what are we talking about the USDA puts a grade on meat from the standards in which it has to meet now each one of them is going to cost a different price as you climb up that ladder of more marbling more tenderness more juiciness now select it is the cheapest steak you can buy you walk into a grocery store and you look at it a lot of stuff is select then there is choice which is right below prime but quite a bit ahead of the Select people and he is gonna have more marbling and we're gonna get into that and show you what we're talking about here in a minute and he's gonna have better flavor and it's gonna be tender now you get up to prime it's like driving what you call a beat-up old banger forward pickup truck or Chevrolet er dodges made in 1960 had three hundred ninety thousand miles and the fenders fell off of it to going up to the Cadillac Escalade which is prime now I'm not telling you what to buy but I would buy choice or prime that's where you're gonna get the most of what you pay for and you're gonna realize it when you eat it I have went to the store and bought a piece of select just to know ribeye they're laying there and I have a piece of Certified Angus beef that is choice now they grade on the high-end of choice this is not marbling this is a line of gristle that is not clean a piece of tissue in there that really is going to make steak tougher you see very little what I could call marbling in here marbling is what I call beef butter now you're going to see it in a steak but the longer the steak sets out it's going to disappear because it melts as it's getting closer to room temperature but it's little white flecks of a little fatty tissue that make it so good I mean make it tender can used to be this way when she first come along she was looking for the Peace of cleanest red-meat she can find folks that ain't what we're after I'm after them little white flecks that all run down through here that is gonna make this a great marbled steak to cook it's going to be more tender and it's gonna have more flavor there are more numerous the little white flecks in here they're not big long stringy things that are gonna be like hard to cut and hard to chew and if you going up and you get a piece of prime and you lay out there that thing is covered with snow flake marbling we have two rib eyes laid out here but the perfect steak to grill for the most tenderest cut of meat you can have what is that a full light next I would probably say it's going to be the ribeye or the chuck I very good on marbling whoo and it's so good now we do a lot of New York strips or Kansas City strips they're gonna have a little more wine on one side and be cleaner on the other there's still that tenderness there's still that flavor if you're looking for a choice piece of meat that is still got some marbling but a little cheaper down the scale there get you a piece of sirloin now a sirloin is a good cut of meat it is now it's not gonna have the tenderness maybe so that the ribeye or the strip has but you can make that steak tender too and you're still going to get that taste now there's all kinds of things you can put on a steak out there and I'm not trying to mask the flavor of any steak I cook I'm trying to enhance that flavor number one thing lime juice now lime juice is not going to cover up in mass flavor what is it a natural tenderizer that breaks down connective tissue in meat so it's gonna get in there and absorb and it's gonna let that meat just sort of soak up in that goodness and it's gonna make it the best most tenderest thing you can find just put you a little on there or you can use a real lime rub it in really really well be sure you get it on both sides so folks say you've got a tougher cut of meat or maybe you've got a select cut of meat now I'm talking like a sirloin or a flank steak or maybe a skirt steak something that we need to get a little more tender use a tenderizer on it now you need to be sure when you buy a tenderizer first of all no MSG no monosodium glutamate fellers in there but all so it can't be seasoned now I'm not going to use it on a piece of CA B that is a strip a fillet a ribeye and sure I'm never a piece of prime but if you've got an old piece of meat that is a little tougher cut this will help you put it right on after that lime juice both sides rub it in well and you'll be good to go now the next step I'm going to tell you to use when you do this is you should have some of this original seasoning by now where can you get it time for a commercial thank you folks for dropping by you need to go to this website Kent Rollins comm and get you some of this original but make sure you've got some seasoning that you really like and I would prefer you had this we're gonna generously season this little feller then we're gonna rub it in really good on top of that lime juice turn him over same thing on the other side folks these are about it 12 to 14 ounce piece of meat and I'm like to cook a steak that is at least an inch and a quarter the bigger the piece of meat the more seasoning you have to be on it don't be afraid to think that you might over season because you're not on a big old thick cut of beef I promise you there are two common mistakes I think that people do when they are fixing to cook a steak one under season to overcook what would we do with this feller now that we've got season I put him in a ziplock bag a good trash bag depending on how many I'm doing and I would let him set in Nice box for four hours that lime juice and that seasoning will get in there and things are going to become even more tender and a great flavor enhancement is fixing to take place the next step is we're fixing to go to the fire folks I can almost feel the excitement in beagle and Frank I can you can tell that they are so excited that it is steak day first of all you need a good clean hot grill I'm using a hardwood lump mesquite today and I would recommend that you use a lump if you don't have hardwood available if you are using a gas grill be sure and check our video Shawn will have a link above them how to get the most flavor out of that gas grill can I put my hand there and hold it for more than five seconds no I it is hard enough to go it is cleaned it is old lower up or down so this is good and hot probably I'd say five and a half to six inches away from them cold the first contestant is this beautiful River hear that sound I like that soon his brother here we're shutting the lid it is the same with that gas grill I want to keep that instant heat in there that I was so hot we'll open it there at the last but we're gonna let it open right now because that smoke is circulating here and coming out here I'm about a fourth open on the vent here and all the way open on the side I'm probably gonna go in the range of three to four minutes along in there we'll look at this then we'll turn it now there's people out there gonna holler you can't flip it but once who said I cooked over 600 steaks in the last week I turned some of them four or five times before I got them like they want it especially if it is a big old thick cut of meat and you're having trouble with flare-ups or having to regulate your fire now you want you to flip it every 30 seconds the biggest mistake you can Ken when you're flipping is flipping it down there where the beagle can you get a hold of it not one of them grills has got one of them temperature gauges on there you can see I'm running 370 along in there that's sort of where I like to be but I've had it as hot as 450 don't get carried away with that thing I cooked most of my life and ain't never had no temperature gauge so let's take a little gander look there this is probably the hot side now I can see how things have changed and this old steaks begin to sweat a little so I'm gonna tell you right now I'm fitting to turn that rascal because he is getting close to that point this one here he's a little behind that one but not bad due to his thickness there's a little changing of color here but also folks I'm going by this touch what touch is it everybody do this everybody got that don't squeeze it just hold it there really simple take this hand fill of that muscle here's what we're doing you see me touch it I gotta turn it that feller is ready to be turned Oh what are we talking about when I'm touching a steak we're talking about this method here that is what a steak feels like when we're touching it that is rare now change positions put this finger on there touch you have toughen this up just a little bit this is medium-rare now folks that would be a medium and that would be a medium well but if you're having to do that cut them two fingers off like I've told you so many times heat him died once we gonna kill him twice that he is pretty close to what I would call medium-rare so I'm gonna set him up here while his kinfolk is getting ready to be there so I have cooked a lot of meat with a big ol long spatula where I could turn it over never am I gonna use one of them meat hooks to where I reach in here grab that rascal pierce it what happened when you pierced it you're letting some of that juice out he's a little on the rare side that's what I'm after a rare and a medium rare we got to let it rest about five minutes before we ever serve it that way when you slice that piece of meat we have done created that thing to where it's holding the flavor in if you go to cut a steak you're in a steakhouse or something like that and you cut it and everything is running off of it they didn't hold that meat when you cut that steak and you're going to serve it always remember you don't have to worry about it so much those ribeyes strips like that but a piece of flank skirt brisket something like that always cut against the grain of that meat now that is what I would call about medium-rare so were we looking at here what I would call about rare that is what I'm asking I wish you were here I do but since you're not here's what we're going to do I'm going to give your bot Nigel I know you're out there watching my friend come down there and down under in Australia the Beagle just got Nigel's bite Frankie stay in her Sandman tooth I know you're out there my friend it's a little shout-out to two people who are always coming and don't forget to come in on our videos because I try to answer it for one of them now folks you didn't see a bunch of juice run out of here but it's channel zoom in here you can see that juice is all still in there so folks I hope you learned something today I hope you did how to grill the perfect steak number one don't be intimidated to put that steak on the grill you can cook one just as good as I do remember the only time you should fear a piece of beef is when it is still on the hoof alive snorting in your back pocket that is the only time you should fear one thank you so much for stopping by me and Shannon the pups we don't take it for granted that you watch our videos be sure and tell your friends we need to share the love god bless you each and every one we'll see you down the trail and reach down there and hit that subscribe button thank you so folks glad you dropped by today it is a big day it is does this need to be the short one the long so sorry hey folks yeah in this video I'm gonna show you how to grill the perfect steak okay we're gonna buy it how to press it and then how to grill it to get that perfect doneness that you're looking for stick around you said that's so easy

        "content": "skirt steak so you can see it's like a meat scarf keeps you warm in the wintertime good for a girl in the summer [Laughter] [Music] hi I'm fairly and today I'm gonna show you girls skirt steak and grotmann garden and make a beautiful summer salad using ingredients from every pub so skirt steak comes from the underside of a cow it's super long it's sold like this you can see it's also very thin it doesn't take a long time to grow it's my favorite kind of meat it cooks really quickly and it has the most flavor like this this meat doesn't have that marbleization but all that nice good fat and everything like you don't need to trim off any of that and it's cheap this is a really inexpensive cut of meat so first things first we're gonna marinate the skirt steak I'm going to dump my quarter cup of granulated sugar we're doing about a tablespoon of the chili flakes in there I'm gonna do a quarter cup of water so you could give that a little bit of a stir kind of help dissolve the sugar so it makes this marinade really special as a fish sauce so fish sauce is a really common ingredient actually in countries all around the world and Italy they use something called Cola Torah and China they've got like a fish sauce Japan the fish sauce I prefer comes from Vietnam the thing about the Vietnamese their sauce that makes it different from other fish sauces is that they only use two ingredients anchovies and salt this has a lot of flavor and a lot of umami and I think that goes really nicely with the steak I'm only gonna marinate for about an hour you could do it up to four hours or overnight I like an hour nice quick marinade good looks like you want to eat the out of this so it's gonna add it's 1/2 a cup of fish sauce right into there we need about a quarter cup of fresh lime juice the acid actually a lot of fruit juices and stuff are really good for marinades because it helps to kind of break down the meat and tenderizes it it's also helping to make it really flavorful okay so I am just going to probably cut this into like two pieces my girl isn't that long then I can grill this whole so I'm just gonna cut it just to make it more manageable this is about 2 pounds of skirt steak that's a good amount so I'm gonna marinate this in the ziploc bag I like using a ziploc bags for marinades because I put the meat in there and I'll put the sauce in there and it kind of gets all over its just add this in there make sure you get all the air out this block it the just like that and then just rub it in there make sure it gets all over everywhere spicy a little bit salty a little bit sweet all the good things on the grill okay so I'm gonna put this in the fridge for like I said about an hour so while my steak is marinating I'm gonna go out into the garden and pick some fresh veggies for a lovely salad well in here I'm actually gonna light the grill and get that going so follow me so this is the munchies garden every year it just gets like bigger and better and more beautiful someone got here and see what looks fresh we'll pick it make some a nice of it come on so we've got some chives here and put some chives into the dressing I think there's some nice and mint and I cut the mint this is just carrot tops gonna grab some basil it will take some Brahmans fennel is your cilantro flowers will use some of these for sure I'm gonna pick this lettuce here and up here we have snap peas and they're looking so good easy like this I just seen a Jeffrey now okay this is pretty good I'm gonna get just some cilantro and some more herbs and we're gonna take it to go this is porridge looks pretty good I think we're gonna go inside now and make a dressing gonna go on with the salad how easy is that so I got a lot of really good stuff from the garden obviously we're super lucky that we have that right out there this one of interesting things this is called borage certain edible flower it has a little bit like a creaminess and a brightness to it like an oyster wood I'm gonna use the chives to make a dressing and I'm use the rest of stuff to make a really light and urban fresh salad I'm gonna wash all these veggies and everything so the kind of dressing I want to make I want to kind of offset the really function of the fish sauce in the state what I'm gonna use is a bit of olive oil some lime juice salt and pepper and we use yogurt is one of the main basis for this I don't want it to be something like super creamy and super heavy but just something light and just you know really refreshing I don't think you should be scared of making your own salad dressing I know there's a lot of really good store-bought salad dressings out there but I like to just kind of see what I have in my fridge in my pantry so I'm gonna do some lines for this the basin's I think I vinaigrette is some kind of acid I'm using lime juice with mine kind of did go with the flavors that already have going a mistake those guys it's about couple tablespoons of lime juice in there I'm going to whisk in a quarter cup or so of olive oil season it with salt and pepper in there that's great that's super light really flavorful you could do this as is I want to cut this a little bit more make it kind of creamy so I'm gonna add a little bit of yogurt into this so I'm gonna do about a tablespoon of yogurt into there but a bit of a whisk and I add the chives in there as well that's a nice dressing it's nice consistency it's always together it's not too thick or anything hmm that's great all right so I'm gonna set this aside I'm gonna keep these guys to because just cut them up and I'll add these to the salad also just like that so what I'm gonna do now is I want to slice up some shallots and I'm gonna fry them because I like you know the crispy shallots with this I've got two shallots I'm gonna Finley slice them on this mandolin you don't have to use one of these you can just thinly slice it by hand too I just like to use this because it makes it go a little bit faster I've got some neutral oil here like grapeseed oil canola oil vegetable oil whatever you guys want to use and the easiest way to do this is just to put your shallots and then while the oil is cold and you're gonna let this heat up and they're gonna crisp up in there all right so I'm gonna turn the heat up to medium I probably could have done it before I went out to the garden and all that stuff but whatever sometimes you don't plan very well sue me so this is gonna take maybe about 15 minutes while the shallots are cooking this is a good time to take your steak out of the refrigerator cut it dry and when it comes to bringing temperature so that it's ready to go so much happening so you can see they're nice and golden and they're gonna keep on cooking so they're getting like nice and dark and nice and crispy I'll put them on a paper towel so the great thing about cooking shallots in like a nice neutral oil like that is that they flavor that oil so nicely so that boy all like you don't need to throw the oil eh that's a lot of oil you can use that to cook with just wait till it cools down obviously and it's good to go so I'm setting my crispy shallots aside okay so into my salad we're gonna do this nice mint this is the carrot tops he's gonna put them right in and add the chives into there and got fresh cilantro you got all these nice basil leaves they can just go in there whole like that I might leave these all these guys like little bouquets gonna toss them in there they look really nice and then just all these lettuces kind of roughly tear them they can eat all kinds of different shapes and sizes I'm just gonna finish ispotter snap peas toss them in there so I'm just gonna cover my salad with like a damp paper towel just so that it stays kind of light and fresh you can refrigerate it like this - I'm gonna go grill our sake open this guy up okay getting hot so I'm gonna put this on get here it nice and fiddlin around like 400 degrees is good it's gonna go really fast you only need to put it on maybe like two minutes per side we grilled scallions or probably one many favorite things in summer so I'm closing my girl I'm gonna let it stay nice and hot I'm gonna let it cook me like a minute I'm gonna open bag up flip it over close it again let it cook for another minute and they should be done and good to go [Music] it just nice to stand outside and have a beer and where's my beer the so cold so refreshing there's definitely done please look good they're nice and charred scallions are done excuse me guys the meat you can see it's nice and really charred we can go inside let it rest for about ten minutes and we'll slice it it should be nice and medium-rare in there so it's in pink so while my steaks resting I'm going to toss the dressing with the salad all right I'm gonna do a little bit of freshly ground crack pepper in there I'm gonna add a little bit of salt because you need a little salt even though the dressing is salted the seasons all right I'm just gonna toss this guy that's looking really good add in my bronze fennel take this up a nice coriander flowers on top just like that and then we've also got our orange salad ready I can slice up mistake now okay and this you can just like then they study so you can see it's nice and cooked medium-rare you can just simply slice it do whatever shape and size you want so this will serve maybe like four people everyone like a little bit of skirt sometime you know all right put these scallions on there too and then our crispy shallots you just go right over the steak the skeletons as well okay so that you have it ready to go always walking around with a fork and knife in your back pocket you never know the food so here we go the Christie shallots are so good make sure you get that make sure you get some scallions to benefit of this beautiful salad nice little summer plate those is perfect this is like my ideal summer meal some kind of a protein with like a really healthy kind of fresh salad it's been grilled grilling is key lots of flavor I don't want to eat it [Music] mmm that thing's so good the salad with this steak they like compilations are so well they fairly balanced each other out some other recipes go to munchies I got your back [Music] ",

        "content": "hi folks Keith Roberts here coming to you from s Wallace Edwards and Sons in a storage Surrey Virginia and today I got a great grilling recipe for you it's a classic burger topped with our famous bacon steak now our ingredient list is really quite simple on this one I have two 8-ounce ground chuck patties some fresh sliced heirloom tomatoes Vidalia onion and we're going to finish the burger off with some of our quarter inch thick sliced bacon steak all right so since our burgers are on the large size a full eight ounce ground chuck patty I'm going to go ahead and get those on the grill first now one of the reasons I prefer using ground chuck over a basic ground beef just think it has a little bit better flavor profile and you can get a little bit more fat in it and that really does bring flavor to your burgers most people tend to do a lot of flipping in all honesty you want to leave them on each side and really only flip them once during the entire cooking process that means we're probably going to let these burgers cook for a minimum of three to four minutes to each side that should give us about a medium burger by the time all is said and done now we have the burgers working next I'm going to go ahead and put the Vidalia onion on the Vidalia is a little bit sweeter running as you can see I did some pretty thick slices and I'm going to go ahead and put those on the grill off to the side a little bit so they're not quite over direct heat now something else about using a thicker sliced onion it'll help that hold together throughout the whole cooking process and finally I'm going to go ahead and put the bacon steak on the grill now most people don't think about grilling bacon but since our bacon steak is sliced a full quarter inch thick it will hold up to a mighty hot grill now these burgers have been on for about three to four minutes we should have a good char going on the other side so I'm going to go ahead and give them a flip and these are looking perfect and here's what you can really see what i mean about only wanting to flip burgers once during the cooking process we got that nice char which means we've already started ceiling in some of those great flavors and juices and now that we have the burgers flipped I'm going to go ahead and flip the Vidalia onion it can be kind of handy if you use both the spatula and a pair of tongs on this one you really want to try and keep the whole onion in one piece as you can see we're starting to get a few grill marks vidalias and the nice thing about grilling these is that the heat brings out some of the natural sugars that you find in this sweet variety of onion now our bacon steak has been on for about two minutes so I'm going to go ahead and give that a flip you can see we're starting to get some nice browning on there the last thing you want to do is burn any bacon but you'll also see that it's holding up really well over this intense heat of the grill one thing you'll notice about our bacon steak is that it doesn't shrink a whole lot and that's because all we do here at Edwards is a true dry cure that means you're not cooking all the water out of that store-bought bacon out there the dry cure process also brings an absolutely unique flavor to your bacon ok so the burgers have been on the grill for about eight to ten minutes now remember these were pretty big burgers so just watch your time to get that temperature that you're looking for our bday lees have been on for about six they have some nice grill marks the onion has started to soften up a little bit and the bacon steak is cooked right where I want it about medium and temperature or wobbly since it's a dry cure it'll actually set up once I pull it off the heat so there you have it folks our very own version of a Vidalia onion tomato and bacon steak burger compliments of us wallis Edwards and Sons ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hey y'all welcome back to my channel it's been a couple of days since I have uploaded I took a couple of days off after my 30-day challenge but now I'm back to getting my videos up as often as I can today is July 3rd which means tomorrow here in America we celebrate July 4th it's a work holiday I am done with work for the day and it's very very exciting that we have a Wednesday off in the middle of the week since so many people grill on July 4th I thought the perfect video today would be how to grill the perfect ribeye steak ribeye steaks are one of the most flavorful cuts of meats do their high marbling content which is the fat streaks within the steak basically the more marbling within a steak the better tasting it's going to be and the USDA grades these based on the amount of marbling in the cut of meats Prime is the best choice is the second-best and then select is the least amount of marbling usually offered in steaks I would recommend buying a ribeye that's at least an inch and 1/4 to an inch and a half thick so that when you put it on the grill it's not going to get overly done too quickly without actually cooking the steak let's go ahead and jump into how we're going to grill the perfect steaks so the first thing you're going to want to do with your rib eyes is take them out of the refrigerator and set them on a plate letting them warm up to room temperature is going to give you the best grilling experience for your steak so you want to take them out for at least thirty minutes but no longer than an hour before you plan to put them on the grill high quality rib eyes that have marbling throughout usually should taste pretty good without adding a bunch of seasoning to the meat so today we are going to just keep it very simple just going to do some sea salt as well as some ground pepper and we are going to season the steaks on both sides around the edge with that salt and pepper Cody is going to go ahead and just grind the sea salt over the tops of the steaks as well as the black pepper and then we'll flip the steaks over and season the other side's as well just make sure to thoroughly season each side of the steak now that the steaks have been sitting out at room temperature for 45 minutes Cody and I are going to go outside and put them on the grill let's go bud are you ready thing boughs ready there's me there's bowed he's always put these on that grill mmm Oh see you and then mate mate all right guys so the first thing you want to do when you get out to your grill is you want to preheat it to a high heat of about 450 degrees now that the grill has turned on we're just going to sit here and wait for it to heat up the grill is now preheated to about 450 degrees so let's go ahead and throw on the steaks we just threw the ribeyes on the grill right here we are going to cook them on that side on high heat for six minutes and then we will flip them over one way we ensure that we are going to have the perfect steak every time is by investing in a meat thermometer being able to measure the temperature of your steak will make sure that you pull up your steak at the right temperature every single time and you won't have an overdone or an undercooked steak we usually pull our rib eyes off between 145 and 150 which is kind of between medium rare and medium so that is the perfect temperature for us however feel free to look up the USDA cooking temperatures online so you know exactly when to pull off your ribeye to suit your liking also one side note is once you pull those steaks off and let them rest they do continue cooking for another minute or two so when you pull them off that temperature will continue to rise for just another minute or two now that it's been 6 minutes Kodi is going to flip the rib eyes after about five minutes he'll use a meat thermometer to check and see how done the steaks are letting the steak rest allows for the juices to redistribute throughout the state giving you a much more tender and juicy eating experience pulling in those meat science terms I learned while I was taking meat science courses y'all we added a big pat of butter on top of each steak and now I'm just going to stick it in the microwave for those 10 minutes while we finish cooking the veggies alright guys we have let the rib eyes rest for about 10 minutes while they are resting we finished up these sides that go along with it so tonight we did loaded mashed cauliflower so we stuck some mashed cauliflower with cheddar cheese bacon bits and sour cream and then additionally on the side right here we did a mix of mushrooms and white onion and we sauteed it with some butter and garlic and that'll be delicious on top of the ribeye so here is our little plate for this evening it looks absolutely fabulous I can't wait to dig into this ribeye oh yes I hope y'all enjoyed learning how to grill the perfect ribeye it is just about time for me to go and dig in all right guys if you enjoyed today's video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up subscribe to my channel down below right down there and we'll be back again real soon with another video bye guys thanks County for helping me make today's video anytime baby happy 4th everyone yeah happy fourth hope everyone has a safe and fun for the July if you're here in the u.s. so time for ice to dig in to those delicious rib eyes don't drink and drive but drink just don't drink and drive make sure you have someone that's reliable but they're only 15 and have their learner's permit you're still good I'm just kidding Oh golly don't do that time for us to eat be safe ",

        "content": "okay I'm doing inna step of the open range and we're gonna talk about summer grilling tips for States two of my favorite steaks for the barbecue New York and rib chop two different reasons a New York is a wonderful meaty steak a little bit leaner and a rib chop is a bit fattier a little more flavor two interesting pieces of meat that you might want to try this is a venison rack it's a double bone chopped bone-in very lean really good for grilling lower temperature and then beside that is a sirloin steak they're certainly steaks really great for me because I like doing different things with it and this one is actually stuffed with some roasted red peppers and some horseradish a fattier cut like the rib steak will flare up a bit if it's too hot but in New York likes a nice hot grill because it's a lean meat you want to cook it fairly quickly but it's got a nice thick 1 inch cut to it so it can stay nice and rare and nice and moist inside and then a venison rack because it's very lean it's something you want to cook you can maybe sear it really quick in the hot side of the grill but then move it to a slower side and let it slow roast a little bit because it is lean and you don't want to dry it out too much because he needs can dry out if you're cooked it too much on too hot a grill and then a sirloin depending on how you might stuff but I might handle it can be hot or cold cooler and is slow so we like the rub our steaks down 24 hours before so be nice herbs we do our own spice mixes and then we rub them down really good let them sit for 24 hours and then we grill in the next day we met all our own spice rubs for our steaks we we like to control the flavors and we meet with each one individual so the first of all I have is a red chili rub so it's a good bit smoky it's got some smoked paprika in it as well as some dried chilies so it's got a little bit of heat but it's not killer hot this is what we call our Mediterranean rub and it's got dry herbs and in mountain teas from Greece a little bit of spices like coriander and mustard seed and this is what we call our meat rub and it's based with juniper berries and that gives it a really interesting wild Outback Alberta flavor if you will chopped herbs a big important thing for me I love the flavor of the herbs when they smoke up on the grill it's a nice smell too very very good with a bit of sea salt it melts right into the steak and then it really adds a lot of flavor this is a Chipotle barbecue sauce so it's got a little bit too pulled a pepper in it and the other thing here is probably the most interesting one because a lot of people don't know what it is it's a it's a chimichurri and that's a South American condiment for steaks and it's made with green herbs and olive oil and garlic and onions and a little bit of jalapeno pepper for heat and a little bit of lime juice asparagus is a pretty standard summer grilling vegetable it's easy to handle on the grill people always ask me when I'm grilling or when they're over at my house why do I vegetables look so bright green and taste so good and one of the secrets is you should always blanch your green vegetables in salt water for about 30 seconds to a minute and then ice them and then you can hold them in the fridge for ready for when you're grilling and then when you grill them they stay nice and bright and the nutrients stay in them and it's way more flavorful so I thought we'd grill a rib steak it's um again one of my most favoritest cuts two reasons why it's nice and fatty so it's got lots of flavor doesn't a little bit of a fat through it's a nice full sized steak and I love bone on steaks a bone on steak takes a little longer to cook and always stays a little bit pink on the bone so which is really great because if you're trying to make your steak medium-rare I'm not sure about testing them you you can keep the bone on and it gives you a little bit of leeway so if you make a little mistake and cook it a little bit more it's still near the bone gonna be really tasty grill marks are always fun so rotation 45 degrees and 45 degrees to get that nice diamond effect on your steak that's a rare steak and you can see it's very soft and fleshy next finger is a medium-rare steak and it just tightens up a bit and that's what happens when a steak cooks on the grill because it is a muscle it tightens up a little bit so that's how the purport of you cook it the tighter it'll get so if that's a medium-rare next one would be a medium next one would be a medium well and if you go right over that be it well-done and you can see I rotated the steak to a 45 and you've got a nice diamond effect it's always good your guests will love it to think you're a pro a little bit of time and patience and your end up with a really nice statement the real trick with the meats is that the fatty or the meat the more it might flare up so you got to watch it on your hot side of the grill but you do want to have a nice hot grill because you want the steak to cook and caramelize on the outside a little bit because there's a lot of flavor there but the rare center of the medium rare center will stay as it's a hotter grill the venison chops and the game meats require a little less heat because they're quite lean and you can see the difference there's actually very little marbling to that so you want to keep that on a little bit of a lower temperature so it doesn't dry out too much and a sirloin is similar and then of course we stuff this one and you can cook that on a medium to high heat as well again caramel a station is good the stuffing inside will warm up really nice and relaxing flavor the steak really really well and the other cut out I was talking about is the New York which again a great grilling steak secret for the New York for me is to keep it thick at least three quarters of an inch to an inch thick because that way it stays nice and moist inside because again it is one of the leaner cuts of meat and then the same thing pot grill good caramelization keeps the flavor nice and then finish it with your favorite condiments we hope you enjoyed this cooking

        "content": "everybody I'm Jamie provides and today I want to share with you some ideas on how to choose a steak and get it ready for grilling because sometimes the decisions you make in the store and what you do to prep the steak make as much of a difference as your techniques on the grill so let's look at a couple of steaks that I picked up at the store one of them I really like and the other I don't like so much and I'll tell you why this one over here is a good-looking steak and the reason is is primarily the marbling the thickness the bone and the integrity the marbling is the fat basically the little streaks of milky white fat running through the steak are really important for the juiciness of the steak and for the flavor here the modeling is nice and evenly distributed over here I don't see as much distribution of fat and the fat that is around is is clumped up there are large sections of fat the problem with that is that those tend to melt pretty quickly and potentially cause flare-ups they also cause some gaps in the steak see how this one for instance this is this a bit of fat here is right between two muscles basically and when that melts away there's going to be a hole and the steak is basically going to fall apart you're going to have a scraggly piece of meat over here the clumps are not so big the meat is held a little bit better together it has better integrity I think that makes for a better steak overall now another big issue is the thickness of the state both of them are roughly an inch maybe an inch and a quarter thick and that's a pretty good thickness to start with you want to go higher than that rather than lower than that a thin steak tends to over cook really quickly in the center it's hard to see or both sides of the steak and still leave the interior and you know nice and juicy and rosy red so I find that about an inch is the minimum you can go and of course the thickness should be even throughout you can see that this one was cut so that one end of the steak is actually much thinner than the other end and that's going to create some unevenness of doneness so you want to have a nice even thickness throughout so once you've got a well marbled evenly cut perfectly big bone in ribeye steak how do you get it ready for the grill well I think one of the most important things to do is to salt the steak 20 to 30 minutes before you grill it a couple really important things happen during that time number one the steak loses its very cold temperature right it comes out of the refrigerator very cold and if you were to put it right on the grill immediately it would actually take longer to cook and the longer that it cooks on the grill the greater the chance that it's going to dry out okay as you cook any piece of meat juices are pushed out of the meat and so with a steak the idea is to cook it pretty much as quickly as possible without actually burning it of course another really important thing happens during this time is that the salt begins to work on the steak you've probably heard that salt draws moisture out of a steak right and you don't want to do that for hours and hours and hours because you'll dry out the steak and that's true but if you do it for just 20 or 30 minutes actually that little bit of moisture that comes to the surface of the steak makes for a beautiful really delicious crust on the surface so if you just take a little bit of care to pick a great looking stick and season it well ahead of time you set yourself up for a great dining experience now it's just a matter of firing up the grill and letting the meat hit the heat ",

        "content": "open the barbecue pit boys calm today we're gonna do a book steak barbecue Queens all right it's real easy to do just want to do is get yourself Boston cut or shoulder roast it's also called Boston butt and it's about a seven or eight pound roast right here you can see it's of course bone-in this is what you're going to get your Boston but now you can have your butcher slice up some 1-inch one and a half inch steaks you want but save some money you can do it yourself all right so what you want to do is get yourself saw and well you know we'll want to use something like this miter saw here want to maybe a hacksaw if you got it that might even work better but since we were doing some plumbing this morning we're just going to have to stick with our miter saw here all right so we want about one inch thick steaks and might take two of you to do it because cutting through this bone can be a real chore but you'll get it down Plus that shoulder roast there's a real slippery settler you got somebody around helps cut these up want to do it alright so here we are here like I said cutting these up to one inch you can go maybe one and a half inch thick if we cut them up we like to rinse them down a little bit get some and that bone off of there that bone marrow but that's up to you this is the hardest part of this recipe here's just cutting through this bump but like I said you can have your butcher cuts them up for you now we want to make up some of our homemade barbecue sauce it's real easy to do here I've got about 50 ounce bottle of ketchup and of course you can use your own favorite barbecue sauce something you can pull off the shelf but kind of like making our own here and so one big bottle of ketchup here we're going to add about a cup of apple cider vinegar and you can adjust these quantities the way you like it of course and you want to add a few spices in here it's the usual here I've got about a tablespoon of cumin and about a tablespoon of garlic powder and I got some chili powder here about a tablespoon and I got a little celery seed about a half teaspoon in there you want to go easy on the celery seed all right so now we're we're also cutting up four or five big old howl pi\u00f1as and these are the pickled jalapenos and we're just going to leave the seeds in this will add some nice mild heat to this sauce here and of course you don't want to forget your Worcestershire sauce got about three or four tablespoons again that's optional and let's crank up the heat a little bit more I've got some red heart here like I said this is not going to be a real hot sauce it'll be kind of mild but it goes real good with these pork steaks and beans all right now we're going to be stealing some indirect to heat and here on the grill or charcoals on one side and we'll throw these held pi\u00f1as in here you can use fresh jalapenos if you want it's up to you and we got a one or two big old onions there we just cut up big chunks I'm going to throw them in there too man smelling good already all right while that sauce is warming up we're going to put some of my spices on these steaks you can use your favorite spice this is a just garlic granulated garlic a couple different kinds of black pepper and some chef's salt goes real good pork steaks you just sprinkle both sides so that sauce is uh nice and heated up some well let's sear some of these pork steaks right now before we throw it in this cloth now you only have to sear a couple minutes each side looking for that nice sear and texture before you throw it in the pop just like that right there now we're you got about four 24 26 ounce cans beans these are baked bean style and we're going to be throwing these beans in this pot here once these pork steaks are all seared now you can use a white bean if you want but these baked beans work real good and I'd say the neighbors about smelling this right now think about coming over all right and of course you want to add about 12 ounces beer maybe a little more and because this is a thick sauce here and you want to want to dilute it a little bit because as it simmers now for the next two hours or so this also gets real thick all right let's put those beans in there just a original flavor of baked beans all you really need for this all right you know all about that we don't have to show you too much more of it all right now just before we put the lid on and I throw some big old chunks of the Hickory here you use what hardwood you like got smoked maple skeet hey look at it right like I said indirect heat here opposites hot coals and put that cover on close those vents down because you want to cook it low and slow here for maybe a couple hours about 225 degrees Fahrenheit I'm going down to the house a sausage I got my barbecue shoes are going down to the house the sausage I got my boom you use all make you smell their broth and a red head smells good right yeah maybe another hour to go so I'm going anywhere natural case all right I'm gonna do take a look at good-looking pork steaks right down and those turkey vultures think that might have some leftovers I know on things looking at all right let's plate it up you I'm a bib gonna be a few sides here likes corn chips got coleslaw there got my seed in my hair baby I don't care all right it is time to time to try a little bit of this one thing about doing it this way comes out real tender my pork steaks BBQ be this applies after chicken I got my barbecue shoes on gonna grab their supplies at the chicken I'm above shoes gonna pull some legs it's love you action next time you're looking for good pork steak recipe barbecued beans ",

Danny there you go now this is just a piece of wax paper or parchment paper and then we just make the butter why are you making a burrito so that when we cut it we get a disc of it so we make a little butter touch to paw Patrol zero and that goes in the fridge to put in the fridge to set the fridge okay that butter by the way we make it cold and then these are hot and then we just need to salt and pepper I know you use a lot of stuff and then you wash it off of Barry and then I do a little bit of beer yeah you wash it off I like to say I bathe it bathing whether I bathe it but I think he's saying that you're washing wash or it takes it off is that what I don't have a good piece of steak you see what why would you add a lot of flavor to something that you think if I want to eat a piece of beef I want to eat a piece of beef I know but I'm Mexican so I just put a lot of spices on it just because I have been eating poor fond of it so yeah we're just gonna add some salt and pepper well the question is that's easy the question is what kind of salt always run with kosher salt almost all other salt I'm using salt to try to bring out as much flavor as I can and try to get some water out of this and try to really just bump up the flavor that's what the salt is for it's just complimenting what's already in its flavor it's too kind of swing it out keep it correct yes with pepper coarse ground those courses you can get is best doesn't have to be like cracked pepper I have that works really well too okay so show us how much we should use her service please are you gonna throw salt babe moving salt lay out what your bomb no but what I am gonna do is just make sure that I get a particular amount that I want in it so when I do it I don't go really high obviously the higher you are the greater the spread right and I don't really like right on top of it okay but I do just kind of crack it and make sure that you get a proper dusting of it same concept I just get pepper out art and I do it just with my hands let them and do the other side just to get it just to get it going that battery it worked it does yes it works famously there what's next step cook it oh that's a part I mean it just rests for a few minutes and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna make sure the girls about five hundred degrees and that's part is really technical which you hold your hand over it if you can keep it there for a second or three seconds five seconds it's one second or two second you got about right well that's grilling so what you're gonna do take it over to the grill and you're gonna put it on just like this no butter oil anything on the girl you just for 90 seconds you put under like that 90 seconds later you've turned it 45 degrees okay 90 seconds later you flip it over 90 seconds later the turn so you go diamond pattern on it 1999 the total cook time it should be about so chances are pretty thick which means you're gonna have some give or take we want to pull them off when they're about 128 okay then we get you rest to medium or medium rare okay so let's make sure the girl's house do it so we hit about 500 on here you know give or take so are you doing medium for a certain amount of time or is it just get it hot get it and then leave it like that you know whatever like this thing heats up really really well in space really well yeah you're grilling all right that's hot Wow yeah nice like that remember Kamel go diner now the shape that you put them on there in a shake that's they're gonna cook in 92 messes get a little timer going here now we offered the standard for 90 seconds great is this just to get the grill marks on it's not nothing at all find out cooking with the full marks it's still your hair you just gotta paint at the right color what do you want your mind like medium-rare more on the rare side okay so I'm gonna hit it 90 degrees right now 45 yep that's it just like that that's it and then do that once you gotta get all of them buddy okay see that's great you touch it once okay but did you see to that they didn't stick the smell if the grills are hot enough it will stick it will yes because we are searing it pretty much you're you're such a high heat that you are getting a sear right so you have 30 seconds so you gotta flip up and the most important thing to think about at this point when you're making a steak is is it all timing right now yes it's all timing and pace out to be away you can't walk away - why check the score the game can't do that okay we gotta go you're stirring I'm a keen teamwork flip that one what's with the flames is hot what's with the flames oh my god amateur wait how'd you do that oh cool why why is there flames coming out of there generally speaking do you want to cook it with the lid down all right yes step down yeah most people seem to cook it up right you still want to keep staring at it ha oh I and do did you cook it and what does that do when you cook it up this year well what's happening you get in two types of heat there we go you're getting direct heat from the flame up and you and that you're getting radiantly convection heat that's coming around the top and back right here I know awesome hair my second 25 you want to do it already I got a man up again 42 45 45 45 there's no drag it try to pick the world don't drag yeah I didn't order drank I'll pick it up and then turn it yeah that was beautiful look at this ah myself we're doing medium rare medium and medium ish got that one off and put it over that was quick this is quick this way oh now another 10 seconds we'll get the next one oh damn what can we do for dis I guess you check your Instagram feed could you do that oh so ready now when you grab this next one try to grab towards the center of it when you grab towards the end it's just gonna tear apart okay ready right up the center one oh that's meat oh that one looks like it's bleeding still this is so carnivorous I love it on it what is going on I mean still burning what the flames going on was that too hot with the girl too crazy no so the fat rendered out right yeah and flamed up clearing up God you get a hot flare on it I want to cut one open let's cut one open and see what we're gonna get there like you know you can kind of see what the difference 10 seconds makes it again this one's a little bit fancier Stern's I'm liking this one I don't look at all eat all yeah I mean it's pretty so if you're smelling it about yes if you're sitting for one second that's it [Music] let's get a test and get some professionals in here bring the professionals in and let's get some judges going all right kiddos hi buddy try please that's your piece right there get that get that with that with them with the fork get that with that fork okay stab it there you go Thatta boy now bad I know wait you're gonna I'm gonna take this one ready -

        "content": "what do you think is the best way to cook a steak I've taken three rabbis and prepared them three different ways we're going to eat each one and figure it out we're using two-inch pieces of meat and they're quite nice and here you're searing it first and then putting in the oven putting it in the oven and then searing it and then just relying entirely on the pan this is the traditional pan fry and then put it in the oven to finish it off I just seasoned it with salt and pepper you don't want to do too much to it because if you've got a really nice piece of meat you want to eat what you pay for you don't really want to mess with it so you're creating a crust and then reaching a doneness in the middle that you prefer right I think in terms of margin of error pan frying and then putting it in the oven is the most difficult and you pan sear the steak but you don't cook it all the way and then you put it in the oven to raise the temperature of the middle and then you have to take it out of the oven and let the steak sit for about ten minutes with all those steps it's very easy to overcook your steak if you're not careful right well this one you just have a much larger area of well doneness around the exterior and steaky let's see these steaks you're not gonna wait for me it's very rude I guess we can only really tell once we cut all of them let's dive into the pan fry the pan fry according to Gordon Ramsay on YouTube is the best way to cook a steak and that's probably the way to go if you're using a 1 inch piece of meat being done in the pan for a little bit longer there's a harder caramelization of the fat and that may be having a slight effect on the flavor I don't have a meat thermometer at home they kind of intimidate me I don't like poking the meat if you're straight pan finding it you can touch it you can feel how well it's cooked I think the edges of this one or crispier yet the inside feels more tender this also tastes juicier I think I prefer this one I think this one has a more delicious texture this sear and then oven that well-done perimeter really has an effect on the overall texture and I don't it's better I spoke to a few state connoisseurs they were very adamant that if you're not grilling it reverse sear is the best way to go how do you reverse sear you take the steak and you season it and you put it in the oven a low temperature and then you sear it for about a minute each side it's in the oven for 40 minutes so you're taking a lot of the moisture out of the surface so it looks like it's a harder crust you're raising its temperature so slowly there's a greater window for you to check it and get it right the reverse sear method you don't really need to let it sit because it's done cooking the entire steak is evenly cooked right easier way to get the best result most of the time if you don't have a meat thermometer I think it's a little trickier one thing I notice about the reverse here is that the transition to pink is a lot smoother this one feels richer like a wealthy person would have this this is medium-rare the whole way except for the crust whereas here you got a lot more variation it also looks like a bull's-eye almost the reverse here is more refined this is like a cowboy and this is the Great Gatsby [Music] so do you fancy yourself a cowboy or the Great Gatsby one more Great Gatsby I think I'm a little more cowboy cowboy just seems lower ever I think both the pan-seared and the reverse here are better than the sear and then oven but I don't know that I could say that I that one of these is clearly better than the other I don't think I would be disappointed with any of them really it's only eating them back to back that I notice a difference you hold your fork weird oh yes ",

        "content": "[Music] go to smoke me a plan and brisket we gotta Bob to shoes who's all gonna smoke me a bad brisket got my barbecue shoes on welcome to barbecue pit boys calm today we're grilling up some real steak burgers at the pit and it's real easy to do all right for this recipe you're gonna need some steak obviously and here I have some sirloin you're probably familiar with this cut these weigh about one and a quarter pound each more or less and this is gonna be perfect for a real steak burgers all right now here we're using our Santa Corona you may have seen this before it it's a great grill you can raise and lower the grate at will totally control your cooking temperatures right so we're gonna be grilling direct so we'll spread out these coals just like that and of course you know how to do this right all right now if you're interested in taking a closer look at one of these Santa Corona grills you can check them out on our website and of course we're gonna be using SPG and we're going to season these steaks first before going on the grill so use your favorite seasoning the SPG of ours works good and we appreciate your support by purchasing our SPG it helps support our almost 15,000 chapters in 100 countries now now if you've never had real steak burgers before you definitely got to check it out it's good now we'll place the steaks directly over the hot coals and the idea here is we want to serum serum fairly quickly right we don't want to cook these steaks all the way through we just want to get some of that char flavor which will get into these burgers as you'll see can you smell that it smells good and if you can't you're on the wrong Damn Channel no right all right these steaks just about seared enough you want to sear them to medium-rare maybe even rare and those look just about right all right now pull them off the grill the hardest part about this recipe is not eat these steaks as they are the heck with the Bourbon right no you definitely got to check out the burger version of this maybe you should buy four or five sirloin steaks all right now we'll let these cool down just a little bit we'll just make it easier to cut these up of course the chickens when I smell steak cook it they're here get in line all right so I'm cutting them up like this because we're gonna be using a meat processor or a meat grinder right and you could see that these are cooked medium-rare if not rare and that's perfect just like that boy I could make this video go a lot faster I guess but I kind of like doing this so use that fast-forward button if you're getting bored here oh the rooster is ready all right now thanks to the modern invention of electricity we don't have to use our hand grinders so we got ourselves an extension cord out here and we're gonna grind up these slices of state and I'll tell you having a meat grinder around the pit is a good idea because you could be making your fresh burgers steaks roasts or whatever it's really a lot better than buying your fresh ground hit the grocery or unless the butcher is local butcher he's grinding all day right so we're throwing these slices of sirloin steak you're already charred and you got a nice coarse grind all right the sirloin steak has been round now sirloin steak as you know is lean it's very lean there's almost not enough fat in there to bind the burgers right so we're adding a little bit of butter and we're also adding a little more seasoning because we want all that seasoning and the butter fat in this ground beef right here right it'll help bind it oh yeah I told you this is be easy to do so we're gonna make four burgers out of what we ground up this is good enough to eat already as a matter of fact it is right if you work with good quality beef this is ready to go but nope we're gonna be grilling it now you can see we're we're compressing these burgers real tight and that has a lot to do with the meat being very lean of course so we really got to we got to form these tight take the time to make these burgers so it'd be just like that alright let's put them on the grill again direct over the flames but we want to cook them slow and evenly we do not want a hot flame all right because that might just blow these patties all apart if you will make burgers you know exactly what I'm talking about so with our Santa Corona grill we'll put a pan cover on top and we'll raise it or lower it in order to control the temperatures right and we're going about a medium heat all right let's take a look at these and say it's time to flip [Music] now we're gonna get that charred steak flavor throughout this burger that's what makes it a real steak burger right you get it now get flip them put the cover on and work with a slow grill now we're just about ready to serve so we're gonna toast up some buns we've got some onion rolls there we got some seeded rolls we got an English muffin and only take a minute or so to toast up these buns yeah all right I'd say it's time to eat so we're gonna spread a little mail on these that's up to you and pull these real steak burgers off the grill Oh Martha we're gonna be eating good tonight just give me a call all right now you can set these up any way you want on the type of bread you want the condiments you want [Music] we're gonna stay fairly simple nice fresh slice of tomato some nice sweet onions these are Vidalia onions I bred sweets like I said you can go any way you want dressing these up [Music] man seated roll the onion roll [Music] we're havin we have got some of our barbecue sauce and of course as always I do apologize for eatin and funny like this but I call this pitmaster Priya [Music] a real state char flavor in every bite [Music] so the next time you're looking for a burger recipe for your Pig check out barbecue pit boys calm [Music] ",

        "content": "so you walk into your local supermarket and guess what's on sale steaks on sale but it's raining it's a bad day you can't use the grill so what are you gonna do we got a stove we've got a flying pin or a grill pan let's make some steak next on sweet Willy's okay so I was over at my local supermarket and they had a real nice sale on non sambar porterhouse steaks nothing too thick you know like an inch inch thick and I felt like making some steak tonight but here in the Northeast today it's raining it's messy out and it's actually kind of cold so the grill would be so and so so I want to share with you a little tip of what we do when it's during the winter months when we don't lose the grill typically what I do is we we use the oven all right we don't use the broiler but we use the heat this is something that I picked up by years ago and helping Braun by using a cast-iron skillet and cooking a steak with a cast-iron skillet I don't know how many you have a chance to iron steel but I do and it was my grandmother's to get everything started we'll take our steaks out of the fridge let them get up to temperature and then we set our oven was high as we can not the broiler but the oven and while we do that I'm gonna take the pin it's gotta be an oven-safe pin guys alright alright so you've got out whether you have you know a good old fashioned stainless steel pan like I don't like something like this all are these guys here one of those anodized eels or even cast iron that's good so what we would do is we would take that we want to get that hot so when it's time to get things cooking everything will be up in temperature so while this is happening we're gonna give you a little taste of what we're gonna do take these take the pan we're gonna stick it in the oven at five five zero five hundred and fifty degrees get that up the temperature so when that happens all right these should be nice and relatively to room temperature when that happens we're gonna put a little canola oil on it right in all the oil has a higher smoke point than olive oil so we can get that crust going it's that pin and then first so we're gonna oil these up and then we're gonna use whatever seasoning you like if you like a steak seasoning that you know some of the manufacturers make go ahead you know mommy Gracie like the old-fashioned Lowry sand salt daddy likes sweet Willy likes good old-fashioned salt and pepper on his so that's what he'll put on is actually with season those up first and then when everything gets the temperature then what we will wind up doing okay we would sear it one side for a minute and then we're gonna flip it over for another minute then we're going to flip it over stick it in that hot oven for three minutes flip it over and then another three minutes then we'll take it out and take it off the heat and it won't put let it rest so that'll give us a nice medium-rare to medium state depending on the thickness that's how we're gonna do it so when we get back we'll be up to temperature and we'll show you how we season everything and then we will be right back okay okay so we're back and we've got a we got an oven that's up the temperature now so what we're gonna do is look at the steaks ready to put these on this thing so we'll take a little the canola oil and rub that rub that on the steaks here ok bubbles up these are oiled up so when the heat hits them they're gonna put a nice crust on when we use that crust to keep keep all the juices inside alright so oiled up alright and for Bobby and Gracie we're gonna use a little of the seasoned salt they like that me I'm salt pepper kind of guy yes do salt and pepper on one side and pepper and salt on the other side how's that for that's living on the edge guys okay so here we go we're going to take this take this out of the oven hopefully I'm doing this before the fire alarms go put the steaks on for one minute on each side all didn't I say that we gotta put the flame on high all right so we're gonna wait 60 seconds and then we're gonna flip them over wait in another 60 seconds then we'll put them in the oven so this is how a lot of the great steak houses do okay they they they put everything on the grill to get that char and then they finish everything up in what they used to call a salamander it's a real high heat type of oven we don't have that here in the kitchen but we'll do the best we can all right a minute is passed you can see what we've done is we've gotten the sear going on one side goin timer for a minute again all right so everything is searing that's the idea that's why we do this so guys I hope everybody has had a good summer so far and I hope some of the things that we've done so far on sweet Willy's kitchen have worked out well for you I'd love to know what your favorite recipes are what your favorite shows are that we've done so far please so please comment I'd love to hear what you guys have done and I know a lot of people haven't been inspired to do a number of things and still please don't forget to comment on what you'd like to see on the kitchen that gives me more ideas and we're at four three two one right so what we'll do is we're gonna flip these over stick them in the up go away for three minutes so three minutes of past let's see what these things look like okay they're cooking nicely so flip them over they come in that huh we'll stick them in that hot oven for another three minutes okay okay it's time the timer is going off we've cleaned off our cutting board and it is time take these boys out of the oven take them out of the oven see you have it there's only cooked up nicely we've got the grill marks again we hear like our meat rare so that's hence the reason why we dog with a minute on the side and three minutes if we want it to go medium-rare I would recommend you go say four minutes aside and if you want to go medium to medium well you go five minutes aside okay so for rare we go for three so for medium we go for four and four well we go for five again if we're going to be using a nice piece of meat I don't understand why somebody would want their meat well-done like that it kind of loses the purpose so like we did in the grilling the perfect steak video what do we do we let the meat rest for about five minutes that way when we cut into the steak juices don't run all over the place so we'll see you in five minutes and we'll have everything all put together you can see how this turns out okay we're back the meat has rested for about five minutes so it's time to take this off the bone okay so we've got the porterhouse which gives you the strip steak and the filet portion so there's two sections here so we're gonna get a piece here you think as you can see the color okay it's nice and pink here nice and juicy pink again this was a relatively thin steak it was less than an inch thick so that three minutes we got us to my medium-rare so I'm just going to take this down you're gonna slice this up some nice pieces here like so I'm gonna take that and we're gonna put this on the tray do is we're gonna serve this with a little baked potato drizzled with some olive oil and some my nice salt and some steamed broccoli and cheddar cheese so that's how we're going to cook a steak when the grill can work or it's too cold even cook so if we want to cook inside you could still have a good steak so for those of you are subscribed I thank you for those of you who haven't please do and those of you been watching I thank you very much so for now I'm sweet Willy up and in my kitchen and we'll see you real soon ",

        "content": "hi everyone tim here from the thermal works kitchen and this morning we're going to talk about getting perfect results with steaks on the grill you'll note as I place these on the grill that these steaks all have different shapes and different sizes and different thicknesses as well those states are going to cook at different rates then you throw into variability of the cooking surface so these steaks are likely going to cook at different rates and finish at different rates but that's not going to bother us at all because you've got a thermapen mark for and we're going to verify the internal temperatures of these steaks one of the common mistakes that people make when they're taking the temperature of state is to take the temperature before they flip the state it's only been on there for a moment or two you can see that down near the grilling surface we have temperatures of in the 90s and then as I pull that probe through the state you'll see that it gets lower and lower those are called gradient those changing numbers on the thermapen those aren't errors or looking for the temperature this thermapen is fast and accurate enough to give you basically real-time information as you pull that probe tip again the sensor is a very very tip of that thermapen as you pull the probe tip through the steak and the numbers change that's accurate information about the internal temperature of that state and the different numbers of called gradient this steak is cooking from the bottom up there's a hot grill surface and kind of a cool top and it's cooking from the bottom up we're seeing different temperatures now that we've flipped these steaks we have a cooked surface on the top we have the bottom that's beginning to cook so let's go ahead and do our gradient test again we've got 136 down there at the bottom 110 96 92 and then 100 at the top that lowest temperature that we saw that 92 that's what we call the thermal center of the needle and that's the number that we're tracking today we're going to be cooking these snake to a medium rare which is about 130 degrees we're going to pull them at about 127 degrees so that they can continue to rest up to 130 degrees off of the heat so I'm looking for 127 at that thermal center I'm going to see other numbers I'm going to see 130 I'm going to see 140 but I'm looking for the lowest number in the center that's my thermal center when that's 127 I'm going to take that steak off and I'm gonna wait for the other states to reach that same temperature you can see I've got a hotter temperature over here and this steak is almost done getting close to being done and this steak over here is not even close so as I pull the temperature through there [Music] 104 106 so my lowest temperature over here was 104 and my lowest temperature over here is 118 currently so a big difference in terms of the rate of cooking on these states so I'm just going to verify this stake in a couple of points and the measure here I've got a 130 it's got a 128 and I've got a 131 so I'm calling that one done I got to 128 and let that continue to rest up to about 130 degrees perfect medium-rare temperature 127 that one's done let's pull it off so these steaks are going to continue to rest up to a perfect medium-rare will custom open see how they go but all of that was possible because I had a some offense which has to speed and accuracy to tell me what's going on with the actual gradients inside those states if I were to use a dial thermometer or gustatory thermometer that I bought at the grocery store for example response time on those types of devices anywhere from 12 to 20 seconds so that ruler literally means that as you pull the probe through the state and you notice that we both passed the center and pull through the center we would have to hold that thermometer in place for 12 to 20 seconds at each change of temperature to make sure you had a verified accurate reading on that thermometer your hands going to burn off and it's not a practical solution so with a super fast and accurate thermometer like a thermo Penmark or or a classic thermapen you're going to be able to get that real time information and pull each steak off the grill as it reaches that perfect temperature let's go eat ",

        "content": "hey guys so in this week's episode I'm gonna show you guys a fun little trick that I like to do with steak now most of you guys have been cooking for a while not very many of you are newbies so I wanted to show you guys some tricks of how to kind of get out of the normal rut and doing the same old same old can I get stuck doing the same things you want to try something just a little different to spice it up a little bit no I'm just kidding we're not we're not making it spicy so in this video I'm going to show you a fun little trick I like to do with limes and garlic on the grill I don't know if you've ever done it before but if you have then just ignore this video and never watch my stuff again you won't spice it up alright so here we go I'm gonna show you guys how to make a I don't even know what I want to call it I guess it's just a tip on a trick to use lime juice on your steak it just makes it like a little sugary crisp lime zesty crisp on the outside all right let's quit talking and let's get right into it we're gonna start with our steak now that I have a New York Strip nice and lean but it does have that beautiful fat cap now here's tip number 1 lots of salt and lots of cracked black pepper that's the key so many times I've had people ask me questions about like when they have one of my steaks like why is it so good because I use a ton of seasoning especially if you have a large cut of meat you don't want to under season it so you can see here I'm using quite a bit of seasoning now here's a little trick you put some salt and pepper on your plate and then you put a little fat side and the other side so every single inch of your beautiful steak has a little seasoning on it now to save on dishes I'm using the same plate here when a season very simply some asparagus just olive oil drizzle a little Drive salt and pepper and that's pretty much it all right here's the lime trick you all know the lime trick I've talked about this at nauseam you just roll it to get the juices loose to lose the juice then we're gonna squeeze the lime juice now here's here's the the tip the trick so I use lime juice on my steak and on my vegetables because it has a really beautiful sugar content and it's got that sweetness it's got a little tart little zing little zip and it adds a much more fun flavor characteristic to your food at the end now you're not really gonna taste lime it's not gonna want mean it'll taste a little bit like lime cuz it's lime juice but I mean you're not it's not just lime juice oh here I'm cutting a head of garlic in half put that on some tinfoil drizzle some olive oil and add some salt and pepper then we're going to wrap the 10 foil up in a tiny little bundle around the garlic and then we're gonna cook this for like 25 35 not 35 minutes or so I'm gonna start right in the middle the heat will get we'll get to that second um oh yeah I almost forgot I had a jalapeno pepper so throw that on there same thing a little salt and pepper and some olive oil really easy if you do it like this to you save on dishes because you only have one dish that you're mixing everything with and that's head to the grill ooh slow-mo alright so here's our little bundle package of garlic and I'm gonna put it right over the heat just for like the first four or five minutes or so just to get a hot real quick and then I'm going to move it over to the side so that the ambient heat can cook for the rest of the time we're gonna put our steaks right over the hottest part of our coals wanna make sure the coals are red-hot before you start cooking you're using charcoal make sure all the charcoal flavor like the pre light stuff make sure all that you know lighter fluid butane taste is cooked out so like 30 minutes or so so I'm gonna rotate the steak a little bit to get a little bit more even crust now I added those limes to the grill now they're hot so that juice is loosening up even more I'm gonna squeeze some of that juice over the steak add our pepper pop helpful and let that toast don't put the pepper directly over the heat because it'll it'll burn pretty quick alright okay so now I flipped the limes over so now they're starting to get charred now we've got a completely different lime flavor profile now we've got toasted lime sugars so that juice is going to be toasted lime juice roasting roasty lime juice that we're putting on our steak you see the little dark bits on the steak actually the sugar starting to caramelize and make these tiny little like little nibbles little nibs of lime Rosi candy fantastic delicious okay so I finished cooking my steak about half way removing the grates I'm adding some Applewood I'm gonna put the Applewood directly over the coals let it start to smoke now we're putting the stick off to the side not directly over the heat add just a little bit more of that delicious roasty lime juice now we're gonna close it and let it smoke for like five or six minutes or so now this isn't like barbecue so you don't want to smoke it forever oh look at this so the smoke is white that's what you want you don't want black smoke black smoke tastes acrid all right once the steak is just about finished throw your asparagus right on there and I throw them over the open fire so they get kind of a charred actually you can see on that one right there it's a little charred but I like that if you don't then you can put the fire out but I dig it all right so here's what the garlic looks like when it's all done so we can pull all of our treats off all right let's head back into the studio and I can see what it looks like everything is just so gorgeous and easy and I actually like that there's a lot of green on this plate you want to change up the colors it's cool all right so we squeeze this lime three times and there's still juice coming out you see that gorgeous oh and the pepper kind of the the heat mellows out just a little bit once you char it in this way so if you don't like the hot stuff then don't eat it oh look at this this is the money shot Oh garlic oh yeah like but a baby like but a baby it's so good so rich so amazing that is just those are a few tricks of how I like to make my steaks Chelsea loves these but if you're making these for your your lovely lady or for your boyfriend or husband or something like that make sure you both eat the garlic because it is potent in very garlicky unless you're a vampire are you you're not a vampire are you so yeah there's there's the tip a little lime juice and then toast that lime juice over the open fire so it gets charred and eautiful it kind of changes the flavor profiles like that's something I want you guys to do when you think about cooking especially if you if you cook a lot and you find yourself making the same thing over and over and over again add little things like I'm sure you've grilled a steak before but if he roasted the garlic or toasted lime juice and then put that over the top so like these little tiny things that can change up the rut change up the rut needs to be a t-shirt maybe I don't know if you guys have watched the video this far you obviously liked it so

rib steak with scallops and clam sauce all right now here we've got our nice piece of rib steak here I had the butcher cut this is about a 2 pound piece and look it's about 2 inch cut thick of course the rib steaks got that nice bone in there it's real good and uh here we've got some scallops now these are about 15 count scallops about 15 per pound we've never had scallops before you gotta check these out is it awesome mollusk it's real sweet and tender and then we're gonna use some clams here here I've got about a pound of clams for the clam sauce you're going to need some garlic you need a shallot if you don't have a shallot and use a little onion gonna need a lemon here we've got some butter you can substitute olive oil butter here we've got some steak rub this is salt pepper granulated garlic little red pepper flake and I've got some Old Bay seasoning which I'm going to season scallops for and here we've got some chopped clams it's clam meat that you can buy in a can this happens to be real tender baby clam you can find the most anywhere and of course you're gonna need some salt here we've got some white wine got some olive oil and for the clam sauce you're gonna need a little bit of heavy cream all right let's put this together here now we've got these grilles set up for indirect heating we've got the hot coals on one side like to do zones like this and this way to control your heat and fire now because the steaks gonna take longer than the clams scallops we're gonna season the steak up first again salt pepper garlic or whatever your favorite steak seasoning is man looks good enough to eat already all right now we'll put it direct all over the coals and we're gonna sear both sides of this steak maybe three or four minutes each side now why we're waiting for this steak to sear what we want to do here is uh take a black iron pan put it over the coals get it good and hot cuz we're gonna make a clam sauce for the scallops and I'm also gonna want to season up these scallops for a few minutes before we put them on the black iron pan and uh now you got to be real careful with seasoning your scallops scallops serve a real sweet tasting mollusk real good and you don't want to over spice in it in fact if you're in doubt about the spices you have don't spice them at all real good now I'm gonna put a little bit of salt on one side you want to check your steak man we've got about another another couple minutes of searing on that side before we flip it now here again I've got this Old Bay seasoning this is a real traditional seafood spice flavoring here but you want to be real careful just used a little bit sprinkle it lightly one side only otherwise it'll overpower that taste of that scallop we flip this steak oh yeah now of course good rib steaks got a good fire goes with it it's got a lot of fat in it don't worry about all right now that pan is good and hot I'm gonna throw a little pad butter in there melted down and this here's about two tablespoons a shower and if you don't have a shower like I said you can use it you can use some money and then we're gonna put it in about oh maybe two tablespoons of lemon juice we're gonna take one crushed clove of garlic and throw it in there you want to sweat them down just a little bit you wanna hold due to Charlotte's garlic all right now we move the steak off to the direct coals being direct we cook that stick just the way we want without burn all right the shallots garlic sweated out here we're going to add about one cup of white one now this is the kind of recipe that you really impress your boss with you're looking for raise or promotion maybe are you trying to hook up with a new girlie hey this works here every time add a little more butter never enough butter and then about Oh a tablespoon maybe two tablespoons of lemon juice and now we're gonna throw the clams in we're just gonna steam them what I'm just when they open up move that pan more direct over coals steam of real quick that's why you want to do it zone grilling that's where you can control the heat all right those clams just opened up it's only taking a few minutes it's where you want to add about maybe a half cup maybe 3/4 cup of heavy cream we're gonna reduce nice and thick this clam sauce and pour it all over them scallops and here I've got about a cup of that chopped clams these little baby clams I was talking about throw them in there and let it cook real gentle all right just a few minutes on that we already Oh dad clam sauce is coming ride-alongs move it away from the direct calls slow simmer now it's time to do up them scallops now scallops are only going to take a couple minutes so we've got another black iron pan here and get it good and hot it's the key to cooking scallops serum real quick look at these see they're nice and tender moist always want to look for a natural scallop too now put a little butter in this pan you can substitute olive oil I want to cook them the butter and chance you get a clam sauce is thickening up all right that black iron pan is good and hot now we're gonna sear these scallops again just about maybe two minutes each side at the most just as soon as they get that nice Brown sear on the outside you flip it and do it again another couple minutes and it's done you don't want to overcook your scallops cuz of toughen up on man at stake just about done take a look at now flip these scallops can brown them on the other side life goes around the pit reading rib steak scallops and clam sauce it's time to plate

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "what's up y'all big jake here once again doing something very special today we got some USDA prime New York steaks also known as strip steaks and we're gonna grill these up this is all I'm gonna be using on them is a basically sea salt or kosher salt you can use one or the other some smoked pepper if you can't find some mocha pepper just get regular old pepper and some garlic powder or granulated garlic we're gonna rub these down and let them rest how long do I let them rest well basically we're gonna be cooking these on my Weber over here Weber Kettle I got a about half a chimney here full of a lump charcoal and once this all burns down and then kettle was heated and ready to go I'd like probably 450 somewhere around there and that's what we'll fill the steaks on we keep it super simple when you got really nice meat like this you keep it very simple and cook it real hot give it a nice sear cook it rare on the inside and it'll taste awesome so let's get these steaks uh rubdown and wait for that fire to get ready also if anybody's wondering now how much of the rub do I put on about that much basically lightly sprinkling it on you don't want a heavy coat of you know salt or pepper or garlic of any of the three just a nice light even coat on all three all right so all those poles burnt down to nice kind of ashed over to where this is ready to go as you can see here on the dome temp we're almost at 425 excuse me almost at 450 so that's where I like to cook on this thing usually the hotter the better to be honest also one thing that's very important is I make a 2 zone fire you can see coals are on this side and no coals on this side so let's get these things started all right Charlie here we go let's listen for that sound ha yeah [Music] there we go that's really all you need to do at this point I leave the lid off cause I like to watch for flare-ups prime means you're gonna have a lot of fat in the steak and if you're not careful you will get flare-ups also with the lid off you're gonna get more airflow underneath the steaks it's gonna keep that loanshark will burn it nice and hot like that so right now we're gonna do three minutes aside and then maybe two minutes you know as we flip them so three minutes one side flip them three minutes and then flip them back again two minutes again on each side so total five on each side and then kind of see where we're at all right y'all three minutes in I did move around just a little bit we're getting some flare-ups here in there but uh nothing too bad got a nice sear on that side a nice sear on that side then what we'll do from this point it looks like this side is cooking a little bit hotter so I'm gonna move it over here so just more lump charcoal on this side what I'll do now is right now I'm getting a nice sear on them and once I feel like they're they're nice and connell eyes and seared up I usually will move them over over here to the right side and maybe even put the lid on at that point that way you can get some like convection kind of heat going to finish them off at the end all right again y'all move these around as I said these are prime so they're really fatty so we're getting some flare-ups but it's not were that big of a deal it's not horrible got a nice sear on that side [Music] yeah we're gonna do two minutes and then flip two minutes and then we'll see where they're at all right these are definitely what I want as far as color I wouldn't get any more feet on them than that I'm at the ICC they are definitely charred up both sides look good got a nice caramelized color to it so let's check the internal temple I'm gonna assume they're probably not done yet let's see yeah these are still pretty cold these are still down in the 80s so this one's probably gonna be a little hotter because it's thinner so yeah so something you can do now at this point which I would sit this one a little farther away from the heat this is why you have the two zone here that's it this one about right here then close the lid start doing like yeah probably a minute aside all right y'all it's been another two minutes this time with the lid on doing these little more indirect now we got our color established and we just want to finish up the inside there looking pretty good nice and juicy set this one back a little farther this one goes closer let's take their temp again cuz you're getting close and you don't want to burn these things see this one's at 121 this one's almost done this one probably ought to take a little longer as I said earlier because it's thicker yeah this one's down to 103 and now this one's gonna be done quick so another probably two minutes this one will be done if I take it off and then this one might take another two minutes after that so we're looking at maybe in total cooking time of just over 10 minutes I'll assume so anyways we'll be back all right Sean another two minutes in check these out these are looking great I'm gonna assume this one's done yeah we're at 130 yep 135 this one right here that one's done check it out yeah this one's not quite done yet this one can get a little bit more char on this side though so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it back over here direct again I'll let it run for another two minutes and it'll be done after that one more time let's check this bigger one 123 right here 122 you know what though I like my steak a little rare so that piece right there don't be for me I mean a real rare but you know what it's gonna be y'all good you can even let it sit here for another 30 seconds and it'll come up to about 125 128 so it all depends on how rare you want it I'd probably the rarest i'd personaly us steak is about 125 and probably the most cooked I'd wanted is 113 okay so we're gonna have both examples right here all right you let the steaks rest about five minutes you can do as much as 15 you can just get right into them if you want for me I think five minutes passes soon it kind of seems to be the best this one again I took it off at around 135 this one I eventually took it off is right around 126 I think somewhere like that so let's cut into the middle of both of these so you can see the difference this one's gonna be a bit more rare as you can see right there it's really pink some people really like that some people really don't as I said this is probably like the rarest ever cook mistake and this would probably be like the most kick-ass take so kind of your choice it's up to you as far as time I would go more by the thermic end you know would anything else but we can't even really tell the difference I guess attend it reason to make a huge difference but let's take a bite of the rare one first-ever one if you really can't how much of a difference there as far as color goes they became of the camera but really very juicy tender you can taste the spices if it's not overpowering it's a very good cut of steak just try this one out I don't think don't know if I can tell much of a difference so about ten degrees or so doesn't make a huge difference really at least not to me this one's like maybe slightly chewy err I would say but not very much so anyways mmm Oh deed New York primes ten minutes ish so no time internal temperature just depends on what you want it salt pepper garlic high heat on a delivery kettle and 450 degrees and again some bombs to thank cell peace ",

        "content": "the best way of cooking a fit is pan fry oil refineries is the best way to cook steak is with butter just butter alone no oil because it helps the caramelization process basically making the meat brown you get a lot more flavor put into the beef you see one side turn it over sear the other side you want a couple of minutes on each side probably about three minutes on each side and then with a fillip because it's round you need to seal all the way around the outside as well what I do at the restaurant that Oscars to try and keep the heat going through the meat so it's not starting to cool down on the top is I'll continually baste the steaks with the butter that's in the pan it's a lot better if you use a heavy bottom pan not a film on they seem to retain their heat a lot better they don't get as hot as a thin pants oh you're not going to you're not going to burn the state because that's what you don't want that it's going to be able to take bitter and it won't look very good and then you want to probably about five minutes just to let them eat rest after you've cooked it take out the pan put on a try and leave it that let the muscle relax it'll start letting a lot of the juices come back into the meat and it will just eat a lot better if you leave the rest the ROM cap that'll take slightly longer depending on how you want it cooked for a rare room cap you're probably looking because it's it's slightly thinner and longer than the Phillips so it's going to take less time for the heat to penetrate into the into the core of the me so for rare steak I'd probably only cook it for about five minutes make sure it's sealed all the way around nicely seasoned and a lot of said before keep based in with a butter and says it's not going to lose the heat from the top of the cap roughly about two and a half minutes on each side then let it rest as same as the Phillip let it rest the rest of the run cap is slightly more important than the Phillip because there's a lot more it's a dense a piece of meat fill it is a nice soft piece of meat boy by the name off of you know of the of the muscle the room caps been used a little bit more so you know you need to take a bit more time on letting it rest once you've cooked it it's important as well with the room cut because it has the has the strip of fat across the one side and to seal that off as well make sure it goes on nice nice brown color nice caramelization with the butter and it will eat a lot nicer instead of having a raw piece of fat left on the side of the of the Stoke the code above that's been taken off a trip river beef and obviously that because of the answer sighs the the piece of meat is going to take a lot longer to cook it's the same process as pan frying they fill it and the rump but then obviously because of the density of that piece of meeting then going to have to go through the oven to carry on that cooking process I'll put that it will be rare sounds and the world called the other two steaks PAMF right see on all sides it's a bit a bit more difficult with a coder book with a bone in the middle but with cooking it on the bone it also imparts a lot more flavor into the meat keeps it a lot more tender you know won't dry out as much as it you know it could do without the bone be in there because that's protecting part of the meat as it were so let's seal that off to sort of like three three four minutes on each side make sure it's nicely nicely caramelized well-seasoned same cooking processes with the the ROM cap and the Chateau I'd keep based in it while it's in the pan I'm also going to a stage where it would be medium-rare in the pan it's right in the middle it's going to be very rare so then that's when it would be placing you oven for about 10-15 minutes our brains are hot oven about 200 degrees make sure that you pre Helion you don't want to put the meat in there and let it cool down in temperature and then come back up because basically all that's going to do then is made that the me contract on itself you'll lose a lot of the moisture either me it'll be it'll be dry and there is a tendency for it to be slightly tough if you do that so make sure that your preheated oven and turn the oven on set over 200 degrees then start pan frying your steak and to make sure the oven is nice and hot take it off the stove pretty straight in the oven in the pan if you start seeing it off in because then you're not going to have any loss of temperature is going to keep carry on cooking that sounds at the same time is what it would on the stove and again once it's been in the oven sort of 10 to 15 minutes removed from the oven put it onto a try let it rest same as the other two steaks it needs a time to rest let them eat relax the rest in time is almost as important as the cooking you know that the actual cooking of me ",

        "content": "[Music] so how to cook the perfect steak it's a question that I get asked all the time and I'm going to show you my way how I think the perfect steak should be and it starts with getting the right cut now I'm using the ribeye or as we call it here in Australia in New Zealand the Scotch fill it and it's from that rib area so it's flavorful and tender and it slightly works being that rib area in the rib cage and this marbling makes it perfect for cooking the best steak because it can take a lot of heat and it can take it nice and fast which is exactly how we want to cook our steak so first of all what we're going to do is just oil our steak I don't Aurel the pan I always put the oil onto the steak and I just rub it into the steak like that and then I seasoned really really well with lots of cracked pepper little or as much pepper as you want but I use nice lots of salt because that's how you going to get that nice crust on the outside and just Pat it down lightly and then turn it over and all those bits of salt and pepper that are on the plate you just want to soak them up and then do exactly the same to this side here so that's all the prep that we have to do with our steak we're now ready to cook it so the next couple of steps to the perfect steak one is to have your pan smoking hot I've got nothing in here and you can see the pan just smoking away and that's how you want it because soon as you put the steak in a lot of that heat in the pan is gone it just like that in a blink it's gone the second thing is your steak must be at room temperature so before you do the last part make sure you have your steak out about twenty to thirty minutes before you actually start seasoning it and cooking it because it's going to cook evenly so we're going to get our steak and put it straight down in the pan and that's the sound you want to hear that nice sizzling sound now I haven't oiled the pan because I've got oil on the steak but I will be popping a little bit of oil in there in a short time when we flavor it up with some butter as well but a good way to how you want your steak cooked is right in the palm of your hand now if you take your hand like that right there is rare right there is medium rare right there is medium and right there is well-done so depending on how you like your steak I like mine medium rare but depending on how you like yours that's how you cook it just by touching it and feeling it you'll get the same feeling in the palm of your hand it's been about a minute so we're going to turn our steak over and you can see there those beautiful marks that say exactly how I want my steak now I turn it every minute so it cooks evenly on both sides now I want to start rendering some of that fat that's down the side so all we have to do is pick up the steak put it down straight on the pan like that and we just want to caramelize and render that fat down now I'm going to add a little bit more olive oil to the pan and I'm also going to add in a knob of butter as well and then on top of the butter I've got some fresh thyme just throw it in there just push this leg over get that time get all the fragrance is released and then just get the pan and start tossing all that butter and juice straight over the top of the steak and all those flavors will infuse on top of the steak and do the same on this side with the steak as well so I'm now going to take it out of the pan and leave it to rest now that to me is how you cook the perfect steak but what I like to do is just take it up a notch and this is optional if you wanted to stop there you've got the most amazing steak after you've let it rest for about four to five minutes but what I like to do now is paint one side with Dijon mustard just all over the top and then what I'm going to do I've got some fresh chopped up chives and I'm just going to place our steak the mustard side down and just press into those chives and when we lift up we will have all those chives stuck to the steak and it is just glorious and all we have to do is just cut our steaks and oh just smells so good [Music] so slice it up just like that and look how beautiful and medium-rare and all that pink in there just looks glorious and I'm just going to sprinkle over just some baby parsley just over the top just to finish it off and that is how I make my perfect steak I'm telling you that meat is so flavorful and tender that my knife just runs straight through it it is like cutting butter it is truly amazing packed full of flavor and those tribes and that mustard is truly incredible now you know how to make the perfect steak I suggest you go out and make it [Music] you [Music] ",

        "content": "all right this is the back strap that I killed just in the day it was out four-point buck with my muzzle loader if you haven't seen the video well I'll put it right there in the corner you can click on that link and it'll take you so you can see them the whole hunt but this is a back strap from that young buck and to start off with we're going to start getting some of this stuff on top of the back strap and then we're also going to remove this silver skin this stuff right on my back this is unedible it's really tough but before we do that we start clinging it up some of this stuff on top can be a little tough we don't want in fact so we're going to trim this stuff off and anything that you feel like well I don't want to throw that away you know I wish I could keep it you can also put with your hammer so you just lay some of this stuff off because it doesn't make great steaks use sharp knife for this obviously just trim it off there we go we're going to do that all the way down your back strap making sure that you got all the stuff that you don't want on your steak cut off like give me that towards the end of the back strap you might have some fat on there cut that off as well put that to the side so that looks pretty good I like what I see and now we're going to start cutting steaks some people like to cut them in really big steaks and they'll cut them later but we sometimes cut them in individual steaks so what I'll do is is I'll come over here and decide how much thick do I want to give somebody so uh I got my son behind the camera he's my camera a day what do you think is that big enough for your sister right there um hello my a little more right there yeah yeah looks Lincoln that okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut down through the back strap but I don't want to cut through the silver skin so I'm just going to lightly cut and I'm just going to cut it to the bottom just like that so it's still got the silver skin on the bottom but I'll cut through the muscle the meat if you can see this silver skin muscle and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna get it to the edge of the camera keys so we're going to move it to the edge of the counter so I can get my knife flat I will put my knife down through that cut I'm going to turn it sideways and I'm gonna go right down that silver skin and there we have it you have a nice fillet and the silver skin is still on here and we're going to do that for every steak that we make so I'm going to cut down through it again I'm going to fillet it right off and there we go another steak and if I find something I don't like on there I can always put it on my cutting board and trim it right off and there's my steaks I'm going to do that all the way down creating as many steaks and this biggest steaks about one now that we've got our steaks filleted out trimmed out ready cook we're going to create our marinade which I actually took from theory from dinner Rob's got a great recipe you need to see his video if you get a chance and basically I took his recipe tweaked a little bit and man we love it so our marinade is made up push your sock sauce I can't say that sesame seed oil this is Liquid aminos but it's soy sauce it's the gluten-free version we have white wine we also have rice wine vinegar and we have honey and we're going to put all of these into this bowl whisk it up and then we're going to marinate these steaks and so I'm going to do this right now I've already got egg up I'm using a half a cup but I've honestly already used the soy sauce I put it in a bowl and I've done a whole cup that's what's in this bowl one whole cup of soy sauce now we're going to put half a cup of sesame seed oil there we go half a cup and now we're going to get half a cup of rice wine vinegar there we go now as far as the this is a little bit of an ad out of what I've done I'm adding some white wine cooking wine basically I'm add 1/2 a cup honey and you want at least half a cup of honey oh yeah this would be so good now we're going to add a little bit of wishes your sire sauce and I put about about eight or nine deals at that and now we'll just continue to stir this up real good you want to stir it until you can't feel the honey in the bottom keeping you from stirring it feels like it's kind of gummy in the bottom when you can't feel that anymore you just about got it all blended together so now that we've got our marinade made you can take for every two steaks I'll use a pork bag or you can put all six into a gallon bag but sometimes I like using the pork back just because I feel like it gets all the meat marinated evenly without having to turn it as much so we're going to do is we're going to take a couple steaks that's a good one it's a little bit smaller one like that I'm going to put it over a plastic container so I don't make too much of a mess and I'm going to pour some of my marinade I'm going to try and divide it up about third between three bags oops drop that alright so I got two steaks in there here we go the last the marinade awesome and now part of what I like to do is I'll seal it not all the way but I'll try to get all that air out so that ways just liquid and mean just all the way so you can get a good shot that that's full liquid and meat I'm on there we go and I'm going to lay it flat so that way that juice can get all around the steaks and marinated up and I'm just going to set all this inside the fridge for about three to four alright here is my better 3/4 and she is preparing our baked potato night so sweetie what are you doing to these baked potatoes well what I'm doing is I'm using Earth Balance coconut butter we have so many food allergies so we can't do corn gluten or even regular milk so what I'm doing is I'm actually covering these potatoes in the coconut butter instead of using shortening so it's better for you and then I'm going to take some sea salt and sprinkle it on the outside and what it does it creates a nice crispy salty skin on the outside but it's still soft on the inside can I eat me yes absolutely right fierce takes of a marinating we're going to take them out of the bags put them on the grill and cook them all right now these been going for seven seven minutes so I'm going to flip them now all right time to pull off these stakes it's been about 17 minutes on a medium-high heat grilled bacon you haven't tried it give it a try it's got that good smoky flavor and we're gonna chop this up put it on our baked potatoes tonight all right as longer seconds Hey all right so the potatoes are done oh man I can hear them sizzling more papers food the surprise Jesus name Amen so guys if you try and you like it let me know give me some comments if you've got some other tips on how how you like to make backstraps eggs besides that it bacon let me know what your recipes are love the trying ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "so for those of you who are not butchers or who do not have a whole piece of beef in our dry aging room this is a solution that we've come up with so what we've got here is a one-kilo rib drop of dry aged Australian Angus beef this has been grain fed for 300 days and it comes with some really lovely flaky sea salt a couple of these butchers Club signature steak knives and one of our handmade chopping boards now what we're going to do here is we're going to show you how to cook these in two methods in fact we're having a bit of a competition I'm going to cook it in a pan in a he's going to burn it in a pair and I'm going to do it French style which the French cook normally wearing yellow trousers called coats to birth and I'm going to cook that in a pan on this on this stove here and Eric is going to cremate his on a grill all right so shall we let's do it all right [Music] now I would always recommend that you let your steak sit out at room temperature for a good hour before you cook it we will add these two to rest a room temperature already so they're perfect and ready to go on the grill now I'm going to take a little bit of flaky sea salt and give a nice liberal coating to the Chop on both sides also around on the fat there we go and just Pat that all in nicely and a nice crack of fresh pepper again be quite liberal with seasoning it's a very thick piece of meat and you want all that salt and pepper to kind of permeate through and also create a nice crust on the beef during the cooking process all right so now because I'm cooking it on a grill which is extremely hot I'm not going to put any fat or oil or anything like that on the steak John you gonna do enough fat for the both of us right so nice hot clean grill and right on what I'm going to do I've got a red or thick bottom skillet or pan frying pan here on a really high heat you can see smokes coming off it I'm going to put mine down on the back side on its back and I'm going to give this a bit of a crust with searing so as you see I'm on a really hot heat you want your grill or frying pan to be smoking hot as hot as possible our grills in our restaurants are typically around five or six hundred degrees Fahrenheit I mean there is obviously the danger that you're going to burn it but what we do when we cook a steak is we try to move it especially when grilling move it around and flip it as often as possible it allows the the surface of the steak to gain a very even thick crust as opposed to if you were to flip it infrequently the crust would be covering a lot less of the surface but a lot thicker it takes a lot less testicular fortitude I think to cook in a pan but that's why John's wearing his granny's do-rag there which I bought it from your granny that I'm at dinner with last week by the way so I've got a nice crust forming on one side I've got a nice crust formed on the top side okay so this is a coach to birth method we've got a nice seal on it I'm going to add the first part of this butter now once we start adding butter we've got to reduce the temperature otherwise the pot is going to burn we got to keep it moving so I've come off the back full heat to 1 a little bit more gentle and we're going to start basting is the healthy way to cook a steak guys super this is just normal butter it's not clarified see I'm going to base this and I'm now adding a more gentle heat and we're keeping it moving the whole time what I'm going to do now is that a little bit of time to this pan and we're just going to keep it moving and the time will infuse the butter give it a flavor remember this is quite a big piece of beef I want it kilo so it's going to take awhile and we're just going to keep moving around this is gonna be at least 20 minutes this is it's a bit of a bit of trial and error and a bit of experience but we're going to put this skewer down into the thickest part near the bone touch my bottom lip it's going to feel lukewarm to warm to give us a a rare or medium rare now whereas John's cooking it on low heat and basting it constantly on the grill we're cooking on a very high heat I've got the steak on the hottest part of the grill and I'm flipping it every 15 20 seconds in order to get those marks in those lines covering the entire surface of the steak and also so that it doesn't actually burn all the way through so as long as you constantly flip it you're going to get a nice even crust and also a nice even cook throughout the piece of beef no added flavor nowa additional fat on this on the steak just the flavor from that char grill salt pepper and the dry-aging is what you're going to get with with a barbecued butcher's love steak but in all honesty I believe this gives a much better product more flavour nicer crust but it takes a little bit more work a little bit more time we'll see soon which is the best product so I'm turning this again we're going to start basting on this side as well so the butter you see is starting to go a little bit too Brown here so I'm going to reduce the heat a little bit we don't want to burn this butter now it'll add a bit more but you'll reduce the temperature I've got to say that does smell pretty good I thought you were more of a tenderloin man yourself huh not at all Eric you're making that out you lying bastard it's totally untrue so we come up with a nice nut brown butter what about three or four minutes away I believe from mom from this being rare you could add some garlic to this at this point I wouldn't bother peeling and I just throw three or four cloves of garlic in here and that will give them a garlicky flavor but to be honest with you this beef has got so much flavor in it already you don't need to add anything other than salt and pepper but if you are a garlic fan you could add that to it as well the times just going to give it a slight bitterness to it get it to room temperature before you start cooking that's going to take at least an hour for something this thick so you leave it out of your refrigerator let it warm up to room temperature then season and then into the pan but getting it to room temperature relaxes the meat it stops it from having a cold to hot reaction which makes it top I can now feel some temperature to heat through here right next to the bowl in the in the thickest part so we're almost there I'm going to give this one and a half more minutes and then we're going to finish and rest it same with this guy just going to take my trusty pin insert down into the center right by the bone leave it there for a second and then touch that to the bottom lip and that is just starting to warm up a little bit so a couple more minutes and we will be at rare as well how's that deep fried steak looking there Johnny it's looking fantastic Harry yeah I have to say yeah much nicer than your burnt piece of crap I would have I would have seen that a man of your age would have been a little more conscious of the damage he'd be doing to to his heart but come true my to judge contrary to popular belief Eric I am NOT an old man who doesn't want that look at that beautiful delicious dark crust once I carve into that we'll have a nice deep red marbled interior this is going to be the best steak you've ever had in your life except this one you don't want to too many sources too many compliments it's good as it is and I'm going to finish that I think I'm good to go I'm going to remove this from the pan and remove the pan from the heat and I want to transfer this to a resting trip we've got out we've got a reciprocal catch the juicers what we're not doing is putting this strain onto a flat service if you do it's going to steam it's going to make that cross that you've spent a lot of time and energy creating it's going to make it gold soggy and it's going to continue cooking the steak so by resting this on it on a tray it is allowed to breathe it also it also allows the muscles to kind of relax and the beef to be less tough if you were to cut in and start eating that right away the beef would not be as nice and soft as you'd imagine it it should be so let's take a look this is my the same cut of beef this is it cook coax to birth style and that is my perfectly char grilled rib of beef mine's a little bit more refined I have to say mine tastes better and it's cooked properly mine tastes better and it's cooked much better so there you go - at this point perfectly cooked steaks how long will even arrest yours yeah probably about I'd say probably about 10 minutes rule of thumb always rest your steak for about half the time that you cooked it for so if your steak took ten minutes you should rest it for about five in John's case because he's cooked it too well-done you want to rest it for much longer than that we're gonna rest it and we're going to show you how to carve it here's a tip for all you aspiring grill masters out there tongs are good for a lot more than just flipping a steak with you can use them to open your beer well done Eric nice you can also use it for enhancing your jacket alright so here is my beautifully perfectly grilled steak nice dark char on the outside that actually being burnt that's going to give a really nice contrast of flavor and texture to the beef within first I'm going to take it off the bone and then I'm going to cut it against the grain as you generally should with beef if you cut with the grain the beef can and a fall apart a bit all right there we go I just like to say at this point my beautiful coats to birth is resting a little bit longer than Eric's burnt ribeye so mine may well be a little bit more than medium-rare we shall see it's anything because he's overcook yet I don't think so be asleep I don't think so but if I have it's because we're waiting for this to carve this so we can get a little a little close-up there a nice perfect dark pink Center a beautiful thick crust on the outside now that is exactly what you want your steak to look like when you're carving it not well-done like John's deep fried piece of all right hello you Kenny there we are and just fan it out a little bit so ever we can see that beautiful pink Center a little bit of our butchers club sea salt on the corner of the board and here we've got a little bit of our homemade grainy mustard which is made with horseradish and dark ale alright and that is my perfect steak it looks now let's do the real thing here's mine coach the birth we're going to do the same technique but with a little bit more finesse taking it off the bone and I can feel as I'm carving this this is perfect medium-rare there's no medium or well-done about this as Eric might have suggested this is the business I'm going to cut this bit off and I'm going to slice it down the middle look at the fat gelatinous amazing and I'm going to carve the same way nice thick slices nice medium to medium-rare I do agree this is a little bit more Cocteau than Eric's steak but the proof is in the pudding and we're going to taste this I guess that's acceptable and that's my version of a little bit more rested perfect steak I'm going to finish it with one thing some of the juices that we saved the butter and these beautiful meat juices we don't want to waste those it's a little slithering that'll make the big difference and as Eric did dollop of our beautiful mustard cool better than yours freedom I do like the color contrast I let the darkness [Music] sorry mistake on the outside gives it that kind of intangible I agree it totally does but this is still better horses for courses but we'll let you guys be the judge pick up one of our butchers love steak packs take it home try it on your grill try it on the stove and you let us know what you think I agree and if you don't like it it's it's our fault ",

        "content": "hey everybody I'm chef Eddie G from coast-to-coast cuisine and today we're gonna grill a buffalo steak one of my favorites the first thing you'll notice about a buffalo steak is how lean it is there's almost no fat so although we are grilling it today a good way to cook this is to pan sear it as well very light on the spices too you don't want to put a lot to it there's not a lot of gay meanness although you do hear that Buffalo is a little gamey this Buffalo is not gamey at all so you're gonna love this cut of meat and the spices I'll be using today is a little bit of salt and then I have this rub I call it an Eddie G rub and then I also have a little bit of white pepper with some garlic and a little bit of onion powder in there so delicious nice and simple you don't need a lot on there just a little so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the Buffalo I've added just a little bit of oil on there and just a little bit of pepper just a little bit of salt and just a little bit of that Eddie G rub that I've got going on so what we'll do is we'll take that piece of meat and face down right on there like that and then just a little more spices right on this end that chef Eddie G spice delicious and then what we'll do is we'll give it a nice little grill marks on there and it'll come out perfect so what I like to do is I like to put grill marks on the meat so you do a little 3/4 turn just like that and when that does is it gives you the nice grill marks on there and we're doing about a minute on each a minute on each for about medium-rare on a steak this size you want to take it out before you start cooking it so that it comes down to room temperature so if you do like it rare or medium rare the inside isn't cold if we had smell-o-vision mmm smells fantastic you don't want to play with it too much just put the meat on there let it work let it cook and then what you could do is flip it right over and you get those beautiful grill marks on there things I like to do too is just add a little bit of high-quality virgin olive oil on there that around look at how that shine okay and you see we've created these grill marks here we're gonna give it another 3/4 of a turn and now the whole outside of the meat should be pretty much cooked as you see so only do the grill marks look beautiful but it's also a way for the chef to time how well the meat is done if you want a rare piece of meat this size it would be about four minutes so it's one minute then a 3/4 turn for another minute then flip it over for the third minute and then another 3/4 turn for the fourth minute like you just saw me do so this one will be about I'd say medium-rare somewhere right around there so take a look what we've done we've put the grill marks right on that piece of meat look at how beautiful so what we're gonna do is put it right on the plate there a little parsley and I love just a little confetti right around the corner there look at how that makes the color pop off of this thing beautiful isn't it enjoy the nice thing about Buffalo too is it's so lean and so healthy most of it is grass-fed they never use steroids or any kind of preservatives or additives to the meat itself so it's so healthy for you it's actually more healthy than a lean piece of meat and a special thanks to Zee carpentry located in Islandia Long Island for letting us use their custom designed kitchen so this is how you grill a buffalo steak I'm chef Eddie G from coast to coast cuisine and cooking is my passion stay hungry my friends ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "welcome to camp and we are fixing to blow them Cowboys Minds today the wow factor just went off the scale I'm talking a big ol 40 ounce tomahawk rib eye dry aged ready to go who better get there for they do folks stick around [Music] my name is Kent Rollins welcome you all to this channel and what do we do on this channel outdoor cooking grilling Dutch oven cooking bacon how to take care of cast-iron but what are we doing today folks we 40-ounce prime dry-aged tomahawk rib eyes you heard me right [Music] where's it come from it's just the ribeye folks just been French the bone has coming off the rib all the way around so it's a little more presentable now this is prime dry-aged meat I want to thank national beef for getting this to me and look what we have here the culinary meat inspector himself yes it is prime big and the good folks that live freedom meets now folks they do quality they be in this business for a long time and they have some great products Shan will have you a link below down there in the description to where you can go online and you can get this but when we talk about prime beef dry aged beef when we're aging that beef the longer it sets the more flavor the more tender it's going to be now when you're starting with prime you've always heard me say hey we're going to put some lime juice on this deal to break down muscle connective tissue not on these big fellers we ain't because they are prime dry-aged now they got at least 60 days on them so what does that do the enzymes in there go to breaking down this stuff and it gives it more flavor more juiciness more taste now a lot of folks would have this and they just throw this big feller out there on the grill and they're gonna burning now when you're cooking a meat that's of this size folks either got to cook it over indirect heat but your coals are not close to it well remember what we do to keep that stuff tender steam it so we're going to wrap it in some foil after we season it place it on the grill but the most important factor you got to remember in this whole process let it warm up so I'm allowing about a minute per ounce that's 40 minutes it's setting out that way I know it's gonna be warmed up and ready to go if you don't do this you're gonna get such an uneven cook on this rascal by throwing them on they're coming remember what I've always said in them videos what is two mistakes people often make overcook under season this is a great big honking piece of meat 40 ounces so we got to give everybody a share so we're gonna use our Red River Ranch original because I'm cooking over good hardwood mesquite today is we got a plenty of it down here but first let's get it seasoned up so make sure you get it on the sides bottom top every where rub it in really well we're going to let it set about four minutes after that before we go directly to the grill but make sure you get it coated well everywhere well like I told you we let it set with this seasoning on it both sides everywhere coated well what's next we got to wrap these fellas up what am i telling you right here this is the Christmas present every man won't just wrap it up in tempo lay it under the tree so folks let's get them over to that fire Bertha didn't make the trip but her little sister Christine did and she'll do the job so let's get these bad boys on the video we have cleaned the grill wire brush greased it a little now there's still some fire coming out of there so I'm not going directly on it I'm gonna go on each side of it and we're going to let these bad boys sit there for about five minutes and then we're going to turn them on the other side and let it go another five minutes so let's let it do its job hope you enjoy the scenery while we're waiting [Music] now folks there's a lot of sizzling going on there it is plenty hot so I'm gonna rearrange just a little there's a lot of firing there's what you're cooking with we call it live fire a lot of people will have disagreements and they'll fuss back and forth what does that bone do but I do think it conducts heat to a certain point gives more flavor to me a lot of chefs have told me bone don't do that bonus for I appeal only hey I'm like the Beagle that bone brings me more flavor and I get to know it when we're through the reason we wrap these in full y'all know so we can slow them down but also what does that help us do it's getting a more uniform temperature throughout the state now when we take them out of that fold it's going to be closer to where we are already at maybe a really rare we're going to give it good color it's going to get that carmelization because all that flavor has sit right up throwing top and come to the surface but it helps it slow down the cooking to where we're not leaving it on the grill quite so long over an open flame unprotected but it's been about five minutes so let's flip them bad boys over you can see we get a little char here on that bone and warming things up so we are where we're supposed to be we'll go about five on that side take them out of that bowl finish them up and then we will enjoy the goodness this is hotter than the fourth of July in a red ant bed I mean it is hot it will burn you when that steam comes out of there so you'd be careful now [Music] so folks you can see that good color we're getting so let's slow that down a little that's what I was after that good instant seer of heat so we're going to move them over here to the cooler side of the grill what do we got here it is a radar for alien spacecraft machines yes you let you know if somebody's trying to get here and get your meat before it's done really it's a temperature probe folks I don't believe in these it's like I told you before if you puncture a piece of meat you're letting something out of it so I want time I ever use one is when I'm cooking chicken now I'm gonna try to take these off there when they're rare to medium-rare because that's how they're supposed to be eaten now in other videos we have done and Shannon might have you a link down there or right up there one to where it'll show you this method again about the touch and how that's supposed to feel whether it be rare medium rare or medium but if you think you just got to have one because this is some high price meat you get you one okay see this sweating in this blood that's coming out right here and taking a fake too you can see a little pulling now I know there's some good color there and it's time to go I'm after that crust that's what I won't get that good texture so when we get to that point let's give him a good flipping over put him right back out here on that side of the fire now you folks that's got to use a thermometer I have seen a lot of folks they would stick it in right here at the time turn it on and watch it till that reaches that temperature and then pull it off it's done I'm gonna go by the method I've always used and that is them fingers and touch so folks remember these was big old forty answers so we're gonna have to let them rest for a while but one thing you got to know is that's still cooking in there just because we got them off the fire now they insure that process that it stays warm and let it rest enough we're going to temp these big resting for about four to five minutes then we'll cut them whew that goodness will take place just been about five minutes let's take that little pin off always comes a point to where I get a little nervous still when I cut one of them but see this good knife goes honking big knife goes with honking big steak know what I mean and I would like to thank Victor and Arthur two of my fans down there in Brazil for sending me this who've got my name on it thank you so much fellers let's see will it cut a keep cut a piece of beef now if you want to serve this maybe family-style I'd cut right along that bone and then we just take that little rascal and go to chunking him up here then you just take it and come right back through here that's what I'm talking about folks now that bite there has my name on it mmm now folks I've cooked a lot of beef and I have cooked select I have cooked choice I've even cooked some roadkill on occasion but what I'm telling you folks is when you get a piece of prime that is aged and dried this way you can taste it too minute it hits your mouth that's what that aging process does it gives such a unique flavor to meet the seasoning enhances the flavor it doesn't mask it fine dining at its best mmm melt in your mouth it is so good and tender I don't know how to describe that flavor to you but it's it's a little bit sweet a little bit maybe a little earthy but oh man it is so good so tender I want to thank the good folks again at national and Pat LaFrieda and the freedom meets hey thank y'all so much this is great steak Shan we'll have a link right there below to where you can go to their website and you can order meat they'll ship it right to your door just make sure you know how to cook it as we recap this deal let it come to room temperature let it set to you know it's warm it's going to help that cooking process throughout make sure that you wrap that wrestling full and you set it out there and you let it steam in there about five minutes each side then pull it out of there and finish it go by that touch like we always have but if you think you just got to have one of them thermometers high stick it over there when you turn it back on that side get to that correct temperature you want then you're good to go I thank you for stopping by one of my most favorite places in the world ranch down here south of Hollis Oklahoma it is good country that old Red River sitting out there is made a lot

        "content": "hello all right I'm pretty good cooking why don't you try to be a man the next thing is you don't on a big stick there's certain things in life that you should know how to do you should know how to roll your own cigarettes you should know how to drink meat whiskey and you should know how to cook a steak I can't help you with one of those things right now because I'm hungry let's make a steak for my cook a steak was requested by Leo Gonzalez I'm pretty sure I know you IRL hey town boy 2 1 3 you need to revise in the other side Peter Barnes sounds like a respectable gentleman and Christian Philip you got two choices with beer I mean you got two choices mistake yeah beer yeah we chose misty what make potatoes first and how many times have you had steak and potatoes like a lot of times this is how to doing it Oh like if you went to a steak house your point on a date and they're like oh we're so feelers fine wonderful be at the potato that's a broccoli you've had it like a million times you know how much it cost that restaurant to me like five dollars and like a lot of times you think about like the ideology the restaurant you like I'm paying for the food I'm paying for them the skills of the chef who prepared yeah well let's take I mean you're literally being sent for and anyway I seen you make the tail Idaho potatoes number one wait take a fork in your boat you don't poke them they're gonna explode it'll be a potato tears feeling three so we're making at least three days probably more it is that kind of like what if somehow you make a potato bomb they explodes and you die everyone's gonna make fun of you so poke cool hey blue team in oil Oh pepper okay I rub it all over I don't even need to tell you what I'll be sent to the cure a viewer at home and you're like we were like that price is right trademark scenario like what could the ovens temperature be if you did not guess 350 you would be like that guy who like someone bid like $2 and you bid $1 then they go I don't know how long it takes let's look at that I don't like the grill you want you want a grill medium medium high not all the way you got little pictograms ones like tiny flames like raging pillar of fire like the Jews out of Egypt you don't want the last one I know I know like maybe your dad friends someone else was barbecuing you were watching them you were like I don't know what they're doing and you know why is they sad like this Bernal Flav's healthful they were like summoning demons I cook your food on they put some dead animal I'm not sacrificing it - I don't know Satan and they're like pushing on it with spatula like like he was flying up and you got to the yeah you talk cool dad made you the goddamn charcoal clerk and you're like yeah you you know dad dad dad needs a son like me to teach him what he's doing well maybe maybe not a son with a father grandfather of the Sun god damn it we're doing steak this stick okay let's talk about steak beef dear Bob was I talking about steak you're expected to eat it and it's delicious so yeah pedantry and steak why why does everyone have an opinion on the best steak in the world the reason I'm sure you guys like understood how I really feel about the matter the steak is the easiest thing to cook in the whole goddamn world anyone can make a good stick you could do it your dead grandma can do it Saddam Hussein could do it steak it's like it's like quality of and like okay so like every every food you have a ratio or a counter balance yeah yeah so okay so every dish the whole world every food you've ever had has this ratio quality to execution okay so this is like the quality of the ingredient how good is the initial form of the food so how well was it prepared right so if you have something that's like shitty dingy but something like an octopus okay an octopus is a strange creature lives under the sea it's highly intelligent you you it's hard to believe it it exists on this planet it lives in a different biome than you do and it's it's structure boggles the mind I mean it's really just it's weird but from a food standpoint of eating it it has almost no flavor and it's it's it's chute it's like I see if you you were eating a rubber tire in animal form okay so like the quality of that ingredient it's not gonna make that much of a difference right so like pretty much any octopus octopus our octopus or octopodes it's gonna it's gonna be the same it's gonna really matter how the person who prepared the food mate so someone like made a wonderful marinade barbecue it appropriately and then you're like wow this tastes great even though it's like really just a rubber tire that was prepared in a great way that's amazing steak is 100% the opposite of that steak if you buy an expensive steak and you made it wrong it would be more enjoyable then an octopus that was the best octopus ever that was prepared just okay I mean you literally can eat it rough so the cooking whether you sear it for 20 seconds on each side and serve it blue as if the blood and it was like still in the heart of the cow whatever that the cooking matters so much less then the actual agree so everyone everyone who's never touched a snake has like cooked it in some capacity they learn to cook that they've overcooked it they cooked it perfectly and they've been like my god this is amazing this is the best steak and everyone else's thanks to God then those are like they're taking credit but really what's just a delicious thing on its own any goddamn eat on the whole planet can throw a steak on the grill for an arbitrary amount of time literally like 30 seconds to white 20 minutes and it's still gonna taste really good and so you've asked me to to make that well I'm video I'm gonna make it okay stay I have a top sirloin I'm sure you've had it somewhere it's usually the cheapest steak on the menu alright a couple steaks here well those aren't cut and now they are you can rub them in butter I'm too lazy this is like just like the potatoes Oh what kind of rub it in make sure we're okay I'll let these come up to basically room temperature by the way of course 30 or so minutes time to grill go go outside girls probably too hot who cares I don't care take the big stakes you got bars like this you put it on a diagonal angle all right look what we got here they're all gonna have different cook times do I care do you care does anybody care at all probably not they'll still be good now we're gonna close the lid it's not gonna take long can't go anywhere honestly just okay it's all you've been like a couple minutes see that professional sick lines gonna rotator it's a 90 degree rotation right let it resume cooking maybe you can't see it with the smoke with tops cook cooking do that that sides definitely done so is that side we're gonna cook the bottom Oh baby look at you could top your steak with a couple things like onions and then slice on a mushroom cremini these are jiminy mushrooms real thin slice slice some butter butter medium heat like that go go to the 6:00 now we're rotating them the last the last turn even though they're probably already done you push on and you like is that done I don't know the answer is it's actually done okay so these are done they're new girl now snakes need to rest we'll let those rest they're still cooking you got some socks here to this house put it over there keep the topping for flavor beef and bun it's a little bit and mushrooms oh yeah turn heat up a little bit the boxing time I lose Rocketdyne cut it you just keep cutting it so you got just broccoli I'm going to show you the ultimately lazy and also awesome way due to microwave you get a plastic bag but some broccoli in it go to the sink just a splash you see how this corners it has a little bit of water in it that's all you need nuke it for a minute all the way sealant 60 seconds those steak tapas now when you do this either the back exploded or dude this bag exploded there's a ridge so we open the bag carefully so the steam doesn't burn us no problem and we've dumped the broccoli into Sun Bowl perfectly steamed broccoli looks nice oh the potatoes they're done nice roast potatoes and like almost 50 minutes here's a probably like super done yeah that's a baked potato you could eat that all right thanks been rested let me show you what it looks like let's pick this stick let's just cut it right down the middle yeah you see that that's medium to medium well that's okay that's delicious a virgin steak a big thick juicy steak nice grid lines some broccoli well I got damn potato love you champ you're a steakhouse get that potato up in half put anything you wanted in it I saw the broccoli some butter then your potato whatever just think you want some  on top of it we made yes you paid $40,000 for this at a steak house I made this for six dollars you can do it too you dummy let's eat tastes like victory I'm so happy okay and same instinct like a man ",

        "content": "hey guys what's up it's Steve so I've had a lot of requests from not only family and friends but also so from some of you guys out there to show you how I like to cook steaks inside the kitchen so obviously if you follow my channel you know that I do pretty much 99% of my cooking outside on the grill but a lot of people you know either are in a situation where they don't have a grill or maybe they just don't like to grill whatever it is and they just prefer to cook inside the kitchen so the great thing is that you can cook an amazing steak inside of the kitchen obviously they do that at restaurants all the time really high-end steak houses and things like that what I'm gonna be showing you how to do is my preferred method it's a reverse sear that I've showed you guys how to do outside on some of my grills but we're gonna do this with the oven and then a cast-iron skillet I bought some massively thick New York strips that we're gonna cook up so let's go ahead and get started okay so when you're gonna be doing a reverse sear one of the first things you want to do is make sure you get some super thick steak since we're gonna be cooking low and slow in the oven first and just slowly bringing up that temperature and then searing on the finisher just works so much better when you have a nice thick steak I ran across these beast New York strips these guys are about an inch and a half thick they're just enormous they're on sale for $5.99 a pound so I jumped on that and all you want to do is just take some kosher salt and we want to salt both sides fairly liberally all right and flip them over and for those of you that may be new to this process what this is doing is that the the meat is going to basically draw the salt into the center of the meat and so it's gonna provide some extra flavor and it's gonna help tenderize it and so what we're gonna do is after you've got both sides nice and salted these are gonna sit out at room temperature for anywhere between 45 minutes and 1 hour okay so I let these strips set out for one hour in room temp so at this point it's time to put these in the oven so we're gonna go ahead and give a nice little sprinkle of crushed black pepper on both sides okay so now what I've done you want to take a wire rack so you can get these elevated off your pan so you just have some nice air flow going underneath there that's just gonna help with a nice even cook and then the single most important part of this reverse sear method is using a high accuracy food thermometer so we're going to be using the thermo work chef alarm since these steaks are basically almost identical in size I'm just gonna take my food probe here and just slide it straight into the middle of that guy right there okay so again our oven is preheated to 250 degrees we're gonna go and get our steaks in and then we're gonna go ahead and get our probe connected here to our chef's alarm all right and so you can see here I've got the high alarm set to 115 because that's when I want to pull these and we'll pull them out and get our cast iron screaming hot for that finishing sear so we'll pick up pick back up in just a bit okay guys so it has been right at 45 minutes and the chef's alarm is reading out at 115 degrees so we're gonna go ahead and pull these bad boys and let those sit for a second and then we're gonna get our cast iron skillet cranked up to a just searing hot tub okay guys we have our cast iron skillet just raging hot and I'm going to be using about a quarter cup of grapeseed oil and then we're going to go ahead and get these guys in here it's like that alright so let me turn this fan off this for a second so you can hear me it's about every 30 seconds I'm gonna give these a flip and then I'm gonna be monitoring these very closely with my fountain pen and so each flip I'll just come in here and give it a quick little read alright I just flip them again now we're gonna add some butter these are just about done and just continue to flip all right these are about 1:30 and so I'm gonna go ahead and pull these all right then what I like to do right here on the finish is just put a little pat of butter on top and let that melt in just for about 30 seconds or so all right so I only took about 30 seconds for that butter to melt and you instantly want to serve these so let's go ahead and take a look you can just see how gorgeous that came out show you that right there oh my gosh look at that color so you have this just amazing nice little sear on the outside but just tons of nice color on the inside and so for these thick steaks like that you definitely want to cook a low and over low and slow in the oven and then just finish them off like that with a nice hot sear let's go ahead and give that a little try real quick Wow amazing such good flavor so easy to do right here in your kitchen definitely try this out let me know what you think I appreciate you guys watching we'll see you again soon ",

of this warm weather that we're starting to experience as well as the impending Memorial Day I thought we'd dedicate a whole week of content to grilling and grilling related episodes so this is WTF grilling week episode 1 we've got a bunch of great sponsors lined up for the different episodes during grilling week and we're starting off with stagecoach sauces which you can check out online at stagecoach sauces dot-com stagecoach produces a number of different types of sauces that are all great for barbecuing and grilling ok we're going to take a look at their steak sauce which like all of their sauces is free of high fructose corn syrup free of preservatives free of additives free of other not healthy ingredients it's all really raw ingredients that are good for you and are natural they also make a great ruby red garlic sauce which is awesome for marinating chicken and grilling chicken with but today we're going to focus on the steak we're gonna use their sick sauce along with our dinner check them out online at stagecoach sauces calm all right I figured that it was best to start a grilling week with grilling 101 so before we get into the complicated recipes we're going to take today's episode and really talk about the history of grilling and some tips and tricks to make your grilling experience really easy and fun grilling is probably the oldest and I think the manliest way to cook meat it's meat on top of fire there's no messing with that as far as its aged people believe that grilling started about 500,000 years ago it's a long time grilling didn't really do much evolving until the 1950s prior to the 1950s young is always a communal act he would grill in public parks or way back in the day they would grow on a bonfire however everything changed in the 1950s in the 1950s a guy named George Stevens inherited a company called Weber brother metals and I'll go now that company was primarily known for making booties which are these devices that go out into the water to help guide chips home and into port he took one of the buoys cut it in half through a grill inside and drilled some holes and created the first weber grill and weber grills took off the buoy business sunk and basically everybody bought these grills for their home use that was the first time that grilling went from a communal act that only happened in public places to a backyard activity fun fact the phrase come to a backyard barbecue is actually often wrong because the art of barbecuing is very different than the art of grilling grilling you're cooking with radiant heat and it's direct heat the cooking things also very quickly barbecue is all about low and slow it's about indirect and it's all about smoke and today there are generally two camps of grills for your home some people go with a gas grill which uses a gas source like propane the propane heats up a bunch of permanent briquettes that are stored inside of your grill great they hold all of the warmth and transfer that warmth to your meat the other type of grill is a charcoal grill in a charcoal grill the actual lumps of charcoal hold all the heat are on fire and they transfer the heat directly to the meat regardless of the type of grill that you have I have a few tips for you that will make your grilling experience a lot better and your food tastier tip number one is create heat zones don't put Arklow all through the bottom of your grill as it's just going to create a blanket of heat and it's not going to give you any room for play instead put all of your heat source on one side of the grill whether that means turning on one side of the burners or putting your charcoal around one side keep the other side open now you'll be able to move your steak or your burger from the hot side to the cooler side and have more control over the cooking temperature and time point two is keep it clean I recommend using natural lump charcoal and using a charcoal chimney as opposed to using something like lighter fluid for number three we have three essential tools for grilling number one is aluminum foil I prefer the heavy duty varietal it'll allow you to tent your meat you can also crumple up your aluminum foil to help clean off your grill grate before you put the meat down number two would be a spatula from metal spatula the same way that you would flip fish with is a great option for the grill and number three is a tongue it is the most versatile tool in your kitchen I recommend getting metal tongues so they don't melt while you're moving things around over the hot Heat number four is know the temperature of your food food dries out very quickly on a grill so it's helpful to have a thermometer on hand you know exactly what the temperature is and be prepared to move things off the grill about five to ten degrees before they hit the temperature point that you want them at because they will continue to cook another rule of thumb is actually the rule of thumb you can simulate the doneness of meat and then compare and contrast by moving your fingers around on your hand if you feel this pushy part of your thumb right now it is the same texture that a rare piece of steak will be if you pinch your first two together you have medium rare medium medium-well and well-done so as I move my fingers together it's tougher and tougher just like the steak will become the more you cook it alright so today we are going to go through some of the basics setting up a charcoal grill and growing a steak couldn't be simpler first put some tightly crumpled newspaper in the bottom of your charcoal chimney add a few pieces of lump charcoal on top light up the newspaper and allow it to heat up your charcoal depending on the size of the grill and the amount of food that you're cooking I recommend putting some charcoal in the beginning letting that heat up and then slowly adding more I find that if you put all the charcoal in your chimney at once and then heat it up it doesn't heat up thoroughly and it actually goes out before it really eats up while the charcoal in your chimney is heating up you're going to pour more charcoal into your grill remember keep it on one side only once the charcoal and your chimney is ashy and white pour that charcoal carefully over your grill and over the other charcoal cover up your grill and let eat up when the majority of your charcoal has caught fire and is a bit white you're ready to grill lay down a steak seasoned with salt and pepper season early and let it kind of work its way into the meat before you throw it on the grill I'm using a strip steak bone out it's about an inch and a half thick another quick tip if you keep your meat in the refrigerator you want to let it come to room temp trip about 20 minutes before you put it on the grill all you're going to do is make the cook time and temperature uneven and the result will be a charred piece of meat on the outside that is basically Raw on the inside you don't want that I'm also going to cook up some asparagus just toss it in a little bit of vegetable oil because it's a high heat oil with salt and pepper and put that on the grill as well cook the steak for about four minutes on each side remember to use the rule of thumb to determine how well your meat is cooked and when it's done you're going to take it off and tent it in some aluminum foil for about five minutes before you eat so the juices get to reabsorb and it gets to rest so that's my grilling 101 episode and that's how to grill a steak remember to check out stagecoach sausage calm and tune in all throughout this week to hear a bunch of different episodes about all different wild ways to grill see tomorrow on what C's food ",

        "content": "welcome to barbecuepitboys.com today we're cooking up some steak fries at the pit and it's real easy to do all right we got some ultimate beer snacking here going on and this is how we do it here i've got some round sticks or we actually cut these steaks from a round roast all right now round roast as you know or the cut around from the beef is tough real tough right and the only way to tenderize it is um is to stew it right which is often done or marinate the hell out of it and that's what we're gonna do here now we'll trim this um fat off of these steaks right here because the fats not gonna do anything in this case this is a hard fat we don't need it we're gonna get rid of it now like i said round steaks are tough so it'll require a good 24-hour marinade for this steak right now if you use like a rib steak or a cubed steak from round yeah you won't have to marinate it so long but uh in this case we're going to marinate it to get it nice and tender so what i'm doing here is cutting up some fries right now if you're here because you're looking for steak fries made from taters you've come to the wrong place this is real steak fries we're using steak there's not a potato within 50 miles here of the pit now we've got them cut up in basic fry size you can make them bigger or smaller and we'll throw them in this two and a half gallon plastic bag you know use a marinade and dish or whatever you have and now we'll make the marinade and it's real easy and it'll be real tangy and a perfect snack food for a nice cold beer we're starting out with one-third cup of worcestershire sauce all right this is going to be nice and tangy and uh here we're gonna add about a third a cup of soy sauce this would bring a nice saltiness to this beer snack food right now if you've never had a steak fry before a real steak fry you definitely gotta check this out and you better make a ton of them for that game you got going on right now here we've got some balsamic vinegar and we're at about a third a cup of balsamic vinegar and you need the balsamic right it's a mellower taste not so vinegar taste so you don't want to use regular table vinegar right use a good balsamic now for this recipe you're gonna need some minced garlic and we've got about a teaspoon used more or less and here we've got a teaspoon of onion powder right now because this is beer snack and food we're gonna bless this marinade with some beer we're gonna use a about a half a cup or so right more or less and uh be sure to save the rest for the pit master that's the way you do it all right now we're gonna season it a little bit more right so we've got our spg at least seasoned a little bit of salt and pepper or whatever you got your favorite seasoning salt will do all right and even though we got the soy sauce in there and uh here we're also adding some fresh ground black peppercorn pepper is always good for that steak all right [Music] now what i'm gonna do is um of course mix it up right and like i said we're gonna marinate this for at least 24 hours right because this is a round steak in there and it needs all you can give it like i said before a nice tender steak doing this maybe a few hours will do huh man this is gonna be good we'll throw it in the refridge [Music] and we got 24 hours to kill and in the miracle of time and you know all about that 24 hours has gone by and we're going to make the batter or a so-called breading or whatever you want to call it we're going to start out with two cups of all-purpose flour just like that and we'll use another plastic bag you do it the way you want but uh using these bags makes it real easy not a big mess too now of course your breading or flour always need some seasoning so we're going to add about a quarter to a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and you flavor your your batter up the way you want or your flour mix the way you want we're going to add a little more seasoning we've got that spg going on maybe a half a teaspoon oh yeah [Music] give it a good mix oh man and now let's make an egg wash up i probably don't have to show you this part you guys probably know all about it but if you're a newbie haven't been around a long we're just going to make an egg wash just like that a couple eggs maybe a quarter cup of milk right and season it up you can never have enough seasoning with these steak fries and you whisk it up blend it up just like that oh man now like i said we better make a bunch of these because they're gonna go real fast at least one fry of beer right or maybe two fries a beer so do the math make a bunch of these all right now like i said in the miracle of time 24 hours has gone by actually um we did this a day before and we're ready to fry them so we'll take these uh steak fries here throw them in the egg wash then right in to the bag of flour and mix just like that you get it right or you've done this before like i said this recipe is going to be real easy to do i'm telling you martha wherever you are we're going to be eating good tonight now you shake up the bag with your uh slices of steak and coat it really well [Music] now it happens to be only about 28 degrees fahrenheit out here so everything is nice and cold if you're doing in this in the summer or warm weather you may want to um you may want to take these coated steak fries and keep them refrigerated before you fry them you probably know all about that too right but it's so cold out here we don't have to worry about it again shake them up real good get that flour coated all over now here we've got one of them electric fryers one of them fancy electric fires right and they work real good at this and we're going to take a few of these fries drop them in and you don't want to crowd it you want them to get nice and crispy so just do a few at a time in fact you can do these per order right whatever you guys want just make a quick batch because it only take about five minutes before they get done like crispy loaded with flavor on the inside eat one of these and you want another beer right that's the way it goes that's the good things in luck right now let's do a couple more just in case you fell asleep i'll show you how it's done it's about a 350 degree fahrenheit oil right there it's about the perfect temperature and again it'll take five minutes more or less [Music] i'd say get the car started get down to your butcher get yourself some round roast or some round steaks and get going [Music] all right [Music] look at that now this is a total of about a pound and a half to two pounds of steaks uh we did so if you got a big group going on just buy a ton of it and of course this is what you got and uh it should go without saying but we do apologize for eating in front of you like this but we call this pit master privilege yeah we got some cheese dipping sauce we got some ranch dipping sauce we got some seasoned chocolate right use your favorite dipping sauce [Music] cheers [Music] maybe we don't apologize for eating in front of you like this now take a look at that [Music] the next time you're looking for a beer snack for your pit check out

        "content": "hey pitmasters today we're gonna be grilling a hundred and fifty dollar steak and we're gonna love every minute of it [Music] look at this beautiful cut of beef it's absolutely gorgeous 2.7 kilograms will be a Gallagher louia Gallagher is the breed of cow and they raise this cow in Galicia which is a northern western part of Spain and it's absolutely gorgeous so today it's all about this cut we're not gonna do anything special we're just gonna do it right so we're gonna season it with a little bit of salt and smoke it so I'm gonna use my own salt and modeled salt is salt that is has a thickener shape it's made out of pyramids so the crystal of the modeled salt is shaped in pyramid style and you might think that it's a little bit overdone to use a salt like that but the reason why I like using salt like this on a stick is that these pyramids they they melt away so if you get one of these crystals on the beef it will melt and spread out where if you use rock salt it will stay in the same place because of the thickness of the steak you can't really have too much salt on the outside now we're gonna start off by smoking this cut of beef and the reason that we want to do that is because we wanted to get to temperature slowly and we might as well add a little bit of smoke flavor to it I'm using some Hickory for smoking it and Hickory will produce a heavy smoke and that's a good thing because it will stand out against grilling mistake which will also provide a lot of flavor now I'm setting in the deflector plates and I'm putting in grill grates and a beautiful steak on top we're going to smoke this beautiful steak at 150 degrees Celsius which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit until it reaches a core temperature of 50 degrees Celsius while our steak is slowly getting up to temperature we want to make sure that we got the right temperature and we're not exceeding the temperature that we want to reach so I'm getting a reading of 25 degrees Celsius so we're halfway there now we started off with a cold steak so that's about right I want to flip the steak over just to make sure then we get an equal amount of heat on every side oh boy I'm already getting hungry [Music] so it's a little over fifty degrees Celsius we're taking it off the grill be careful you don't want it to fall off the bone at this moment now we're gonna change it up a little bit we're going to take out the deflector plates and we're going to put in this cast iron Halfmoon and that's gonna create a beautiful cross for the meat so we'll take out these grill grates take out these deflector plates with a little poke they're gonna Center the coals put in our half at a low position take a little bit of oil a piece of paper towel and now we're gonna give it some time to really heat up well it's blazing hot and we're going to add just a little bit of touch of Oh more and then we're gonna put the stick right on now we've got a nice bit of sear and we're going to take our steak off the grill put it on the board and we're going to let it rest [Music] the steak has been resting for ten minutes and now going to take it off the bone it almost falls off the bone and we already can see we got a nice bit of coloration from the smoke look at that beautiful and we can smell it because normally if you grill just realistic you only get that grill smell than my yard effect but now we also get a good dose of smoke flavor look at that smoke ring well so we cooked it to medium well-done 57 degrees because I wanted the fat to fully melt you know a piece like this you don't want to cook rare that's so much fat in it you want to see that marbling melt all over the meat and that's the way you get the best juicy beef there is [Music] Wow that is absolutely delicious on the outside of the beef you can see we got this beautiful smoke ring gorgeous but thank you guys for watching I really hope you enjoyed this video and of course the steak they're not delicious but if you ever get the chance to build a steak like this make it for a special occasion get a good bottle of wine and really enjoy the process cooking it do it right and then have a feast give you a big thumbs up leave me a comment and see you guys next time until then it's mark [Music] ",

your butcher box hey there i'm Yankel and today i'm going to show you how to grill for a crowd there are a couple of really important things to remember first of all you need to have fun especially if you're not getting paid to do it so I'm gonna show you how to do that with some of my pro tips number one do as much prep as possible before you get started pro tip 2 easy to cook quick cooking cuts of beef and I'm gonna use boneless chicken thighs today as well because they are awesome on the grill and cook really fast pro tip number 3 I'm going to use sides that go really well on the grill and pro tip number 4 wrap the whole thing up with a really easy quick delicious dessert I've got a terrific menu plan for you today first thing we're gonna do is a flank steak marinated in my all-time favorite beef marinade then we're gonna do boneless skinless chicken thighs with a delicious citrus marinade we're gonna do a smoky summery herb potato salad with bacon some grilled vegetables with aged balsamic and we're gonna wrap the whole thing up with a absolutely amazing grilled peach shortbread time to light the grill coat tip number 34 they don't go in order don't worry start with the things that take the longest first so I'm going to light the grill and then we're going to move on to getting the potatoes going potatoes are obviously something you can do inside on your stove I'm lucky enough to have an extra grill nearby so I'm going in remember when you're doing potatoes for mashed potato or potato salad start your potatoes in cold water [Music] heavily salted water thank and water when it comes to boiling water on your grill do it the way you would do it on a stove medium to high heat when you add your ingredients turn the heat all the way up takes a little while longer but we have the time because we're gonna plan the rest of the party right now we're gonna marinate our proteins right now I'm using my two favorite marinades both of which are in the butcher box kitchen handbook you don't have a copy yet go get a copy we're gonna start with the beef marinade that's real easy I've got minced garlic lime zest fresh chopped cilantro and of course I'm using some beautiful salt and olive cabron cosas extra virgin olive oil we just want enough olive oil to make a paste so I start with a little bit give it a quick stir [Music] when you think about a marinade you have all these amazing ingredients that are using to flavor the beef how do you tie it all together you have to choose an excellent olive oil that really adds the final element all right beef marinade is done now we're gonna do the chicken marinade it's a citrus based marinade so I'm using orange peel and all lemon again with the peel some onion fresh minced garlic chopped thyme chopped rosemary we're gonna give that a quick pulse and then we're gonna slowly add some olive oil to bring it together we want a paste not soup beautiful I like to be very precise with my seasoning so I'm going to season all the meat first before I add the marinade beautiful butcher box flank steaks time to marinate my beef [Music] time for the chicken [Music] after many years of burning myself I realized safety first we're gonna get our grill ready to grill some vegetables so my coals are hot I'm gonna spread out the rest of the coals for the vegetables we want one even surface of coals I let my coals in the chimney they got really hot I add them to unlit coals they're gonna meet and get really hot but while that's happening we're gonna grill our vegetables so we have a medium heat to grill our vegetables and then a super high heat to grill our meat pro tip number 996 we're gonna put our grill grate on and let that heat up so I've got whole years of corn and I've cleaned the silk from the inside replace the husk and soak them in water we're gonna put them directly on the coals [Music] there's a power washer out there but we still have to grill our vegetables what are you gonna do salt and pepper olive oil not too much oil because we don't want it to flare up [Music] [Applause] [Music] a pro tip when it comes to grilling vegetables is keep them in as large pieces as possible that makes it really easy to grill so onions I cut into three pieces not more than that everything else I'm leaving whole will cut it up afterwards [Music] well it's still the apocalypse next door but we don't care about that because we have a delicious summery potato salad to make champagne vinegar Dijon mustard whole-grain mustard mayonnaise just some good old-fashioned kosher salt [Music] dill parsley Paragon [Music] I like to peel the charred skin off of peppers it can taste a little bit bitter to eat you still have all that grilled smoked flavor inside the pepper [Music] [Applause] I'm going to dress the vegetables with some traditional balsamic which is aged 18 years this is from salt and olive in Cambridge it is phenomenal no matter what you do this makes it taste way better it's perfect every time smoky grilled sweet from the vegetables sweet from the balsamic vinegar a little bit of acidity at the end there's gonna wow your guests all right it's time to grill the meat and I'm gonna set up two zones which is what I like when I'm cooking beef I'm gonna sear it on the hot zone finish it on the cool zone and I've actually thrown a couple of wood chips onto the coals those are gonna help smoke the beef so we're gonna close the grill up for a few minutes while we grow [Music] we're gonna close up the grill for about a minute before we do our first quarter turn closing it back up for one more minute one more minute on the hot side then we're going to move them to the cool side to finish the cooking now that I've cleared up my hot zone I'm putting the chicken down we're gonna let the chicken go for a couple of minutes before we turn it and we're gonna let the steaks finish we're gonna close up the grill so that it smokes nicely perfect medium-rare don't forget you got to let your steaks rest at least 10 minutes that'll make the inside beautifully red and reserved all the juices now we're going to flip our chicken and remove them to the cooler part chicken is all set we're gonna pull it off clean the grill off and then we're gonna grill our peaches for dessert oh yeah we're gonna let those rest for about 2 or 3 more minutes meanwhile let's get our peaches on the grill got these beautiful yellow peaches they're gonna go flesh side down as soon as the peaches have a little bit of color on them I'm going to slice them up throw in a bowl and hit them with a little bit of sugar [Music] Peach's have just a bit of color time to pull them off and slice them remember when you're slicing into your flank steak it'll be absolutely delicious and tender if you cut it properly there's a very distinct grain running through the steak and you want to cut against that it's a long piece of meat so I'm gonna cut it in half before I turn it and slice against the grain nice thin slices will make it extra tender [Music] that was awesome I'm surrounded by information subscribe to our YouTube channel watch more awesome recipe content full recipe in the link below

        "content": "hi I'm Rob Barrett and you're watching cooking for dads today we're gonna make kabobs they're awesome and a lot of fun a great thing to do in the summer let's go get our stuff you're gonna need some chicken breasts some steak I definitely recommend getting top sirloin filet or a flank steak don't get tip steak or anything like that for a kabob get some 16 to 20 count shrimp they're perfect for your Bob's to the right size it tastes awesome get some lemons get some coconut milk get some curry powder get some salt and pepper and if you want extra credit get some coriander seed we're gonna make two kind of kebabs today the easiest possible kind and then a relatively complicated one I usually try to keep my recipes to things that you would have around the house normally but we're gonna make an exception because this is so good that's the beef stew tell you what I'm talking about the first one we're gonna do is lemon juice but we're gonna get our meat ready so we're gonna cut our meat into strips and then into cubes I kind of like to keep the cubes small they're just easier to eat and they cook faster so you don't have to wait as long so cut your chicken into strips and then into small cubes put those on the kabob people say you should soak your kabobs and water and you can do that my seam mine tend to burn up either way so these I did not soak in so they'll kind of get burned on the edges but it's not the biggest deal in the world there's our chicken you'll put these on the plate here's our shrimp try to handle all the raw meat at one time then wash your hands now this first recipe it's not really even a recipe I did a bunch of experiments and found out that lemon juice and butter work on almost anything they're super good here's our steak a top sirloin we're gonna cut this in strips put that on skewers so here our chicken shrimp and beef kebabs we're gonna hit them with salt and pepper both sides our flavor magnifiers if you will thanks to chef in for our pepper grinder I'm using coarse kosher salt because it's the best now all we're gonna do is squeeze fresh lemon juice on them and let them sit for as long as possible the lemon juice actually starts to cook the meat ahead of time so don't let it be like overnight but three four hours it's gonna taste amazing then we're gonna brush it with butter when we put it on the grill get lots of juice right on them don't worry about the seeds you're not gonna cook those cover these put them in the fridge and let them sit for like an hour 20 minutes is okay but try to get like an hour to light your grill scrub it wipe it oil it let your grill get hot enough so you can't really keep your hand over it for more than a second put on your kebabs you want to hear a sizzle brush to each with butter let me flare it up a little don't worry about it that's all good all these meats cook at different speeds that's why I put them on separate kebabs because the shrimp is gonna get done first and then the beef and then the chicken you want chicken cooked all the way through you want beef kind of pink on the inside the shrimp cooks like this about a minute aside for the shrimp two or three minutes aside for the beef and probably four minutes aside for the chicken the shrimp are turning red we're gonna flip them over very nice check our beef give that in another minute I know you think this recipe is too simple to be good but trust me it really is tasty and you flip them get the other sides of butter here flipping over the beef oh yeah hit that with butter I love cooking kabobs because I think it's the most basic cooking method that's probably the first thing that cavemen did it stick meat fire good you know it doesn't get any simpler than that the Minnesota State Fair we call it well we put everything on a stick so that's a whole different story but kabobs are just they're just instinctual these shrimp are firm and read all the way through we're pulling them off I'm gonna flip over our chicken very nice brush that with butter these beef cubes are done you can kind of see in the middle there that's kind of pink all right we're gonna pull that off those are done give this chicken one more minute you lose your chicken frames up so it doesn't push it all it is done pull it off you don't want to overcook your chicken okay there's the easy one salt pepper fresh lemon juice and butter these are super good we're gonna make the more complicated ones next but first viewer male yeah they're cooking for dads why do you always say to use coarse kosher salt wall-e's lodge from youtubers so we asked morton salt and then the crack growth back morning kosher salt is a coarse flake salt chefs and food enthusiasts use kosher salt if you like the coarse grain it's easier to get the right pinch something it has a cleaner crisp flavor morning table salt normal salt that has finer cubic sake crystals it also has a free-flow agent that ensures when it rains it pours both iodized and non-iodized table salt are available both kosher and table salt are certified as kosher however kosher salt got us things because is the salt used in the culturing process for meat and poultry the coaching process from eating poultry is under rabbinical supervision and the rabbi's require that of course salt be used there you have it Wally good luck with that send it in for the more complicated one we're gonna make what's called the satay this is actually an Asian kebab it is so good that it's worth going through this F extra effort we are going to take half a can of coconut milk one spoonful of salt one spoonful of sugar two spoonfuls of curry powder some fresh ground pepper and for extra credit get some coriander seeds and crush them up this is completely optional but it's a super good just get about half a spoonful pour them in crush them down they smell just like amazingly good pour that in stir that up this is our marinade for our satay and is really good into that put your beef chicken and shrimp or all the above this really works great with beef stir that up that smells incredible okay put this in the fridge cover it and let it sit for as long as possible even 20 minutes is good or if you can do 3 or 4 hours you're gonna be happy campers and I'll take your various meats and put them on kebabs it gets a little messy but once again it'll be worth it if you want something that has a little different look leave your meat and strips and kind of weave your skewer back and forth into it a lot of restaurants serve satay this way when you're done you'll need to wash up light it scrub it wipe it oil it put on your kabobs so your shrimps gonna cook about a minute aside your beef about two to three minutes aside and the chicken about four to five minutes aside depending on how big your chunks are I keep my chunks pretty small so they cook fast because I don't like to wait for my food flip over our shrimp smooth whoa smoothly flip over our beef a shrimp is firm and red on both sides nicely done take that off our beef is done we're gonna turn over our chicken our chicken is done and we are done with this satay you want to serve it with the peanut sauce either you can buy a premade one there are lots of different kinds this one's really good it's a Sanji peanut sauce or Lian Chin's peanut sauce or you can make your own right here on the grill get your pan small pan use the other half of your coconut milk three spoonfuls of sugar three spoonfuls of peanut butter you smooth if you can these are mandatory things two spoonfuls of fish sauce fish sauce you can give them the Asian part of your market this is Thai curry paste you're gonna do one spoonful of Thai red curry or Panang curry spelt like that put that in for super extra pair that you want some tamarind paste about a spoonful this is really optional you're gonna have to go to an Asian grocery store to get that but it really adds a super taste to the finished product okay you're gonna take this and put this on your grill better keep your your handle off to the side you're just gonna combine all the stuff if you wanna make the sauce over the stove that's cool too this just keeps your house from getting heated up let it simmer for a couple minutes stirring and pour it into a little side dish you're done so there you have it the simple kabob just lemon and butter salt and pepper and the more complicated but super worth it satay with a coconut milk and then the peanut sauce and Rob Barrett this is cooking for dads cook well it's worth it mmm that is worth it ",

        "content": "hi this is chef George from Stella Nets we are here to introduce you today a premium certified beef from Salinas we are from the wrenches and Kansas 12,000 acres of land that the animals growing around and we fed them with corn and and grains that they make an excellent quality the best in the wall in the aging process we take the humidity out of the beef for 14 to the 28th day of the procedure and what we do is it takes humidity out makes it buttery taste and it's much better when you cook it it stays nice and juicy and tender it has that buttery flavor and that side of it here you have the the O's already you can see is all dry and shrinkage in a deeper color and on the other side when we caught it is you can see how beautiful the meat is inside and automatically when you make when the cuts you have to trim it a little bit more than the usual but believe me is worth it to use that this meat because the age that gives you that butter flavored flavor then it's excellent when you cook when you grill it if to make a good barbecue to make you guests happy you need to touch two or three different things a good quality a good grill and a good seasoning then automatically what you need to do is preheat the grill nicely the way you should be as you can see do I keep it in high and I keep one in medium on what side to the grill make sure that it's really hot when you put your hand on the top if you can keep more than three or four seconds it means it's hot enough then in the other side you keep it medium and at that particular moment you make the marks on one side you seal the juices in and then cook it and the other side and medium what I'm going to do now is I'm going to make sure that my grill is nice and clean and it is and I'm going to take a drop of olive oil like this and I'm going to oil the grill and I'm going to do both sides because I want to and a lower temperature than the other side there now is nice it's ready to go normally a nice piece of beef like these I can give you 20 different Murray Nations to go with that but I'm going to put an imagination because it's such a delicate beef is such a good flavor then I don't want any makeup on it I want to feel the taste of the beef that beef rich butter taste well the only thing I'm doing is a little bit of salt and a little bit of cracked pepper and I already put before just a drop of oil and a grill my grill is ready to go now what I'm going to do here I'm going to put the beef right in that position like this I'm going to push it down a little bit like these the marks it will be nicely on the other side and I'm going to do one mark like this and after I will turn the meat and do it the other side and then I will put it on the other side to cook it nicely one of the reasons and I put the seasoning before I can control better the flavor I can control better the level of the of the seasoning when you add salt and pepper in the end you can never get that point of seasoning that is so delicious because it's very hard to be able to season it after some people say well all the blood will go out with my hot grill nothing goes out I seal all the juices in automatically the flavor is there too and now I'm going to do is turn it to the other side and make the other marks and I always use the hotter pieces into the grill soon I will be able to pull it in the other side in a star cooking but what I'm doing now is I'm sealing all the juices inside at the higher fire it's really really high and then I will seal all the juices and now I will be able to do on the other side put them over here and as you can see I have already seated one side the marks are here and it looks the meat looks really really they say eat me eat me they're really delicious as you can see I did one mark this way and I need another mark the other way I make almost like you know a criss cross marks like this and then not only it looks nice but it seals the juices is a reason for that is not juice the beauty the beauty is nice but it's the the juices you seal him inside and then you do the same thing and the other side the other side you do exactly the same thing and you put it into and you make the same marks and the other side and then when you have seared all the the juices in you're ready to put it in the bag and cook it slowly when you have the meat in the fire ladies always use a tongue or use a spatula you don't see me carrying a fork I don't want to have to make a hole over here because all the juices will go on the bottom of the grill and the meat will be dry and that particular piece of meat that certified beef is so delicate it's so buttery it's so delicious then it's really really pretty if you ruin it is you can see the marks how beautiful it looks and not only it looks eiope lling is attractive but the you seal the juices in and the quality of the feed the beef you using a certified beef aged that is so delicious then automatically you don't want to ruin it making holes draining all the beef and right here you have this is the porterhouse steak then you have the filet mignon right here and you have the shell strip and the other side of the thing and you have a combination and it's fantastic normally I this one is medium rare normally this is the way I like to cook is such a delicate piece of meat I don't want to overcook it at the touch you can touch if it's a little bit firm it becomes medium rare if he's like in a corner over here you can see it's very resistant and it's already medium well then automatically if you want to leave it rare normally if you touch you Hin and that side over here it's soft when the meat it has that softness it's me it's rare and it when it gets a little bit more firm that you go up to your finger then it's medium-rare this is a good way to judge The Meters inside with all the tips that I gave you grilling with the good quality of certified beef h the way we do it in the store and a good grill nice and hard seal the juices in voila this is the best you can find on the market a good quality happy summer happy grilling Bon Appetit ",

        "content": "hi I'm Micah and you know recently I was in Canada and visiting with some family and my brother-in-law has fancy whiz-bang barbecue with a smoking attachments to it so we smoked pretty much everything while we were there we smoked the pork we smoked chicken we smoked beef I think the only thing we didn't smoke was some fish but now I'm home in Australia and I wanted to give it a go unfortunately I don't have the whiz-bang barbecue that my brother-in-law has so I decided that that I would go to my local local barbecue shop and have a look and see what they have so looking around I found that they have this barbecue chef stainless steel smoker box so I picked one of those up for about 20 bucks and this smoking wood chip blamed so I picked this up as well now I haven't done this before so you guys are along for the ride and just cleaning my barbecue so I'll take you through some of the steps that I've done so as you can see I've just got your basic your basic barbecue just four burner gas barbecue now what I've done is I've taken a couple of handful handfuls of the woodchips and I'm just soaking them in water for well pretty much for as long as possible and wood chips all over my hands and what I'm also doing is one of the things we tried in Canada was brining so I've had a look and I found a brining recipe for steak so I've just got some porterhouse or strict States as they call them in North America and I've got some bourbon some honey salt and rough chopped garlic and water I'm going to leave them in there for probably for a couple of hours then I'm gonna take them out rinse them off and set everything up mmm give this smoking gig ago so yeah come back in a sec so I've got most of the preparation done I just want to sort of give you a look at what the setup looks like so as you can see I've got the smoker set up here and really it's just a stainless steel metal box with with holes in it and then over here what I've got is I've got a just a pan of water now what I understand is that when you're smoking a meat can sometimes dry out even though I'm brining the meat so I just wanted to have a pan of water in there just to keep the humidity up a bit now I haven't done this before as I mentioned and not really working off a recipe except for the for the brine recipe so with regards to how we're going to cook this the plan is to slow smoke the meat probably I don't know I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to guess but possibly for up to 30 minutes at on a low indirect heat and then the idea is what I'm gonna try is I'm gonna take that meat off I'm gonna crank the barbecue up as high as I can I'm gonna put some salt on the meat and just barbecue it like I normally would which is pile of salt on there for a little bit and then just sort of brush it off just before I'm going to I'm gonna grill it so we'll give that a go and when I'm ready to to cook then I'll bring you along for the journey I'll see you how we go okay so the steaks have been smoking for I guess probably about an hour maybe so here they are here I did some fish with them as well as you can see so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fire up the grill and we're going to cook them as I would normally cook a steak so fairly hot grill let it get hot and I'm gonna throw some olive oil on there and grill them up and see what they taste like right okay so we've cooked all the steaks and I'm just gonna just take a little chunk here hasn't rested yet but let's just see Wow mmm very nice can really taste the brine coming out and there's a hint of smoke so it's really quite nice so I'll put a I'll put a link to the recipe on my web page on my blog page and I'll put the link in the comments below so until next time happy grilling ",

        "content": "hello everyone today I will show you how to cook pork steak this is a Filipino dish we're in pork chops are cut in soy sauce onion and lemon and here are the ingredients we will be using pork chops for this recipe yellow onion soy sauce a piece of lemon and crushed garlic will also use cooking oil ground black pepper sugar and beef or pork broth and here is the complete list of the ingredients that I just mentioned let's start by marinating the pork I'm just gonna grab a resealable bag such as a ziplock bag and put all the pork chops in it just make sure that a bag is large enough to accommodate all the pork chop now we will pour the soy sauce into the bag you can use either dark soy sauce or light soy sauce it really depends on your preference I'm also gonna squeeze a piece of lemon in here and I'm gonna shake the bag just to mix all the ingredients together next we'll seal the bag but before we do that just make sure to push most of the air out before sealing it marinate the pork chop for at least one hour once done we just need to drain the excess marinade and set it aside we'll be using it later on at this point we need to pan fry the pork chops I'm just gonna spray some cooking oil on a pan that I already heated and let's just wait until the oil heats up and once the oil heats up that means it's time for us to put the pork chops into the pan one by one we need to pan fry one side of the pork chop for one and a half minutes we're just trying to partially cook the pork chop until it grounds a bit and afterwards we will turn this over to do the same thing on the other side we will also be pan frying the other side for one and a half minutes once done we'll just take the pork chops out of the pan and set it aside now it's time to saute the garlic and onion let's start by pouring oil on the pan wait for it to heat up a bit and then add the garlic we are using crushed garlic in this recipe you can also use chopped garlic if you want well cook the garlic for around 15 seconds and then we will be adding half of the onions we'll be saving the other half for later let's continue to saute the garlic and onion until the onion starts to soften now it's time to deglaze the pan I'm just gonna pour some beef broth to deglaze it and then we'll be scraping this gently using our bamboo spoon there you go and then I'll just pour the remaining marinade this is the soy sauce and lemon mixture that we use initially to marinate the pork chops in let it boil and then put the pork chops back in here again piece by piece we'll need to cook the pork chops longer until it becomes tender so what I need to do here is put everything all together and then we will be covering the pan and adjust a heat to medium and continue to cook the pork chops for 20 minutes after 20 minutes the pork chops are partially cooked now we need to turn it over to cook the other side doing this will make the porkchops more tender it will also balance the color if you'll notice the site cooked in soy sauce is darker than the opposite side cooking the lighter side in soy sauce will make the color uniform I'm going to add more broth this is just to make sure that the sauce does not dry up while we're cooking I'm also going to cover the pot again and cook this for 18 minutes and after 80 minutes were almost ready it's time to season our pork chops we'll put a bit of sugar here and some ground black pepper here's the sugar and a ground black pepper and we're not going to use any salt for this dish because the soy sauce is already salty if you want to add salt just make sure to taste the sauce first and see if it's really needed just make sure that all the ingredients are well blended and right now it's time to add the last ingredient I'm referring to the remaining onions it's good to have more onions in your pork stay so that'll be really tasty I'll just spread it on the pan and after this we'll just cover it and cook for eight minutes more now our pork steak is ready it's time to transfer it to a serving plate and serve it with warm white rice thank you for watching this video if you liked it don't forget to hit like and share on the video below I am also inviting you to subscribe to our YouTube channel see you next time on our next video ",
