        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hey guys it's Tessa from handle the heat comm and today I'm so thrilled to be showing you how to make ice cream right in your own kitchen with no machine or ice cream maker required I'm going to be showing you three simple no churn techniques that you can use which is the simplest ingredients and tools that you probably already have in your own kitchen so be sure to watch all the way to the end for the best tips and tricks and also be sure to click to blog post that goes along with this video because I've included tons of flavor customization ideas for you to use to really get creative in the kitchen and I also included a special bonus and that is really cute and adorable ice cream labels you can print out and attach to your ice cream and make it a super fun and cute project so if you'd like to learn how to make ice cream with Auto machine then just keep watching alright so we're starting off with the easiest method and that's the two ingredient method so for this ice cream all you need is 2 cups of heavy cream that's been chilled and a can of sweetened condensed milk that's it we're going to be adding some other flavor options but that is all that you need so with the cream in my KitchenAid mixer and the whisk attachment I am just going to whip that up until it forms stiff peaks and once that happens I'm going to add in my sweetened condensed milk but not without taking a little taste of cream first so I'm adding in 1 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk which I've actually also chilled and I'm just slowly mixing that in to the whipped cream then I'm adding in a bit of vanilla extract and for this recipe I'm going to turn this icecream into a peanut butter cup ice cream so I'm adding in half a cup of peanut butter which I've just briefly melted in the microwave just enough so that it is horrible now I'm adding in half a cup of chopped up Reese's piece or Reese's candies you can add in any type of peanut butter candy you want and you can add in any type of spread that you want so instead of peanut butter if you want to do Nutella or cookie butter or whatever feel free to go nuts just make sure that you freeze for six hours before serving that ice cream okay so that was the two ingredient method now we're going to move on to the other methods which you can use any ice cream recipe for I'm going to show you my favorite basic ice cream base this is super simple I just added one and a half cups or one and a quarter cups of whole milk which has been chilled to 3/4 cup of granulated sugar and I just whisk that up until the sugar dissolved now I'm adding in two cups of heavy cream which has been chilled a generous heaping a vanilla extract and a quarter teaspoon of fine salt and I'm just going to give that another little whisk until it all comes together and now you can totally customize this base with any flavors you want or you can just keep it vanilla I decided to do mint chocolate chip for my flavor and I just added in one cup of mini chocolate chips a teaspoon of peppermint extract and a few drops of green food coloring the food coloring is totally optional and usually not a fan but for some reason you just got to have green when it comes to mint chocolate chip so my other flavor I want to do is mocha so I added in two tablespoons of espresso powder and a cup of Dutch process cocoa powder now you can use any cocoa powder you want I just love Dutch process because it is so deep and dark in color it just makes for a beautiful result so for this mocha ice cream I'm actually going to use to freeze and stir method I've just placed the ice cream mixture in a shallow baking dish and popped it in the freezer for 30 minutes and now I'm just going to whisk it up you can see it's starting to get a little bit of frozen bits in it and I'm going to basically repeat this process pop it in a freezer for 30 minutes whisking putting it back in the freezer whisking until it starts to form a thickened ice cream and texture and you know that it's ready when it starts to kind of stick to the pan and hold the shape of the pan so it takes about 2 to 3 hours for this process all together and once you're done you can pour the ice cream into a container a sealable container and you're good to go and of course you have to have a little taste before you do that just to make sure it's good the next method is the plastic method and you may have done this in science classes in school or for a summer project but basically you place your ice cream mixture in a quart size bag you may need to use two quarts ice bags and I had a little bit left over but I just use the one and then place it in another quart size bag so you want to make sure it's perfectly sealed now we're placing those two bags in a freezer bag and adding in 4 tablespoons of coarse salt you saw that I used ice cream salt but you can also use regular salt ice cream salt does work best but regular salt will get the job done so to that salt I added also and about 4 cups of ice I actually ended up adding more ice and you see here our ice maker was being a little uncooperative but what you do is just shake it you just shake it vigorously shake it like you have a vendetta against this ice cream and once you're done it'll look like soft-serve ice cream and you can pop it in the freezer until it kind of gets a little bit harder and that is the beautiful creamy luscious result this one was the freezin store method for my mocha chocolate ice cream and then of course one of my favorites the two ingredient method for my peanut butter cup ice cream Oh can't you just taste the bite and don't forget to download my free ice cream labels at the link below alright guys so how easy were those three methods for making ice cream without a machine I really hope you enjoy them as much as we do and use them all summer long maybe even into winter because let's face it I just face is good all year round and I just adore these totally cute ice cream pint containers that you can get off Amazon I'd link to them below and they make for such a fun project so many flavor customization options is pretty much limitless so really get creative here and I'd love to hear your favorite ice cream flavors that you plan on making with these recipes so leave me a comment below I really hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my channel I'll see you next time with another food video and right now I'm going to take a bite of my peanut butter cup ice cream because it looks and smells amazing mmm so rich and creamy this is was the sweetened condensed milk and cream method and it just is it'll blow your mind if you haven't made this before so I'll catch your own soon ",
