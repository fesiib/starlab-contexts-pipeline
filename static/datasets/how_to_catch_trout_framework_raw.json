        "content": "what's up you guys Timmy bangers here today is April 15 2016 and we're out here at Virgin run lake and today I'm going to show you how I fish a lake like this for stock trout I have with me on my rod this is a the rods and ugly stick elite 7-foot graphite rod medium light the reel is a Shimano similar symmetry 2500 I'm running eight pound mainline on this set up just because I use this for I also use this for other other things but if you're just using trout you can go as light as six pound or four pound if you even have a lighter rod like an ultra light but what I like to do is put a slip sinker on my mainline this is a one ounce egg sinker tied to a bead to protect the knot and then tied to a swivel and then from the swivel this is where I put on my four pound fluorocarbon leader anywhere from 16 to 24 inches this one's a little longer because we have to float this power bait up above the grass there's a lot of grass in this lake I have a size 10 bait holder hook and I have power bait covering the hook completely in the shape of like a hatchery pallet like these fish would be used to eat the power bait on using is gulp natural garlic scent chunky cheese now personal preference what color and flavor you use depends on what they want that time of year but since it's early and they're going to be used to eat and hatchery pellets which are brown I'm going with this and this water is not too dirty it's pretty clear so I think that'll be just fine today and I'm going to add some more flavor to that by using bite on garlic trout attractant this is a garlic flavored it's a you could dip your power bait in or you could squirt it in there or spray it on the bait I mean so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to shake it up put some couple drops on now this power baits already garlic scented so this is just going to spike it up even more and I'm not done yet on to that I'm going to add lip rippers hatchery dust and since that is now wet with that garlic scent liquid we're going to roll it around in this I'm going to get it is covered up as much as you can and that is what you're left with that's what we're going to throw out there and we're going to see how long it takes now this stuff's probably just going to come off most of it but it's still going to put that scent out and that's what you want all right we'll just go past this straight out and see how long it takes to get a bite now the lines out there just going to take a float pull my line down and this way we can watch the one when the bomber starts to move go up when a fish bites the ball will go up like this then you know time to set the hook all right we're going to let that go and see how long it takes right now it's 341 so let's see how long it takes to get a bite all right I'll be back with you guys in a minute all right look at this I always want to wet your hands if you're going to be releasing you don't want to take that slime off of their body he's a wiggler all right nice hook set in the corner of the mouth comes out very easily look at that that is a very nice rainbow stock rainbow and I'm just going to let him go right there we don't want to keep them out of the water too long and there he goes perfect catch and release for stock trout all right guys stay tuned ",

        "content": "I folks at Tegel here from fundraiser company nice to see you again and welcome to today's episode of Thundermist fishing tips we've got a beautiful fall day here upon us I'm fishing today with Antonio as you know our boatless angler from the Thundermist fishing types boatless angular series and we're out here in Port Dalhousie it's early fall we have a boat oh I'm going to say an hour make that an hour and almost an hour and a half of daylight left before it gets dark and that's the perfect time we're targeting salmon and I'll show you my setup here at this time of year you can catch salmon you catch trout we're really trying to hook it to the salmon today and I've got to set up here with my favorite the swivel as you know the t-turn swivel off to a hook and I'm going to on this hook I've got a nice jar of Roe bags here that Antonio did up for us and I'm going to put that row bag right there on that hook just like that nicely and then as a little teaser on the top I have another T turn and I've got a nice trembler fly here it's a trembler by Big John died that for me especially for today and what I like to do with my flies put a little bit of scent on them and they will just absorb that scent any any kind of scent if you have a game fish scent that will be ideal but that scent is just perfect and the salmon will hone in on that and good strike on it so it gives me a couple of chances and because we're only out here for an hour and change I've got my bait caster here as well this is setup regs and ready to go in case I get hung up I don't want to waste the time rereading so this one doesn't have it we're on it but it's ready to go if need be and when we're fishing here we're really not ditional far it's relatively deep so I've got a heavy sinker on there and he with that heavy sinker is it's going to get me down there this is a strong current they want that sinker to keep me in place and unlike fishing in a boat where you got to move around this time of year all you want to do is stay stationary the salmon are moving up from Lake Ontario they're moving up these creeks and rivers and they're in here to spawn basically they come to spawn and die that's what they're going to do and so they're constantly on the move and they're going upstream so all you have to do is stay in one spot and just wait for the salmon to come by and we're hoping to do just that so stay tuned folks between me and Antonio we're hoping to have a great hour on the water there's one there's one like that oh just like that folks I got a scream rods unbelievable Oh better think fast action oh my goodness oh it feels like a decent fish oh that's a good one well when you're fishing for salmon in particular you want to make sure you've got always feels like a good fish you definitely want to make sure you've got a good size reel with a lot of line because as you just seen there oh they're just screaming and I've got that dragged on tight my goodness this is no place for a smaller reel and the other thing I'm doing I've got braided line on here and the braided line the advantage of a braided line is that you can put a lot more line onto your spool so if you do have a smaller reel I had to tell you this thing's really strong if you do have a smaller reel at least with the braided line it will allow you to hook and into and it allow you to spool up with a lot more line I got a friendly angler here on shore helping me out here this is what we ended up landing right there at an absolute beautiful round throat it's not a salmon but it's a great start to our day we just just started fishing in the water for maybe less than a minute and what a great bite that was and what an absolute beautiful fish that is right there so we're going to get back in there I really want to get into some salmon action and the nights just started so with any luck we'll get into a few more fish but what a great start to our day right there love that backhoe they go like I say we're not casting out that far and the salmon and the TRO obviously they'll follow the shoreline they'll come nice and close especially as it gets darker here it's no problem to the fish close to the shoreline they're not as afraid they'll come right up and you'll see them jump in close by - so well folks here's your half-hour update as you see this rods got two teachers on it and no sinker and no hook I got into a snag it's been a half an hour and I'm switching over to my other rod with just the row bag and we'll get it back out there but I got to tell you the reason I like that original setup with the row bag on the bottom and that trembler on the top it's not because I caught a fish right away mind you that's your help but main reason is because that row bag is down along the bottom and it's hovering around the bottom and that that trembler was a little bit higher up top and the trembler with this current is just going to be waving around in there so I'm covering both avenues there I'm covering the very bottom and I'm covering a little bit higher and we'll salmon there moving along the bottom and they're coming up and jumping and the whole key to that setup is those key turns that are the T turns the t turns keep you 100 at tangle-free while you're fishing out there allows Meru bank to spin around the rosettes that streamer fly that trembler just to move around in the water and it will help trigger bite because these salmon aren't really feeding right now they're moving up river to spawn and they're not really on the bite but they're always enticed by a little row bag and in fact if you use a spoon like the the Python tartar or if you use a crankbait or an inline spinner the salmon will hit those two but I think they hit them more out of spike than they do out of hunger to natural reef reflex to them but the other thing I'd like to say we've got about another 20 minutes here even if you don't fish it's worth a walk in the fall if there's a river or a creek off the Lake Ontario and just watching the salmon jump because they really put on a great show and I'm hoping the hook into one more fish here myself or Antonio before the end of the day and like I said I think we have about 20 minutes of that's quarter to seven right now they said the sun's going down at 7:00 may get another five or ten minutes after sundown but we'll see how it goes I did want to say one more thing I always keep my rod in the ready position fishing from shore like this and I'm still fishing they keep it right there in that position and in a great position to set the hook as opposed to keeping your rod tilted in a higher position this is the perfect position right there all I'm doing now is just waiting for that pike which in the past half hour I must say I did I got snagged up on the one and I did have another bite that I hold and missed on he just as I finished saying hopefully we'll get into another bite here Antonio set the hook and he reeled that fish in before he even had a chance to get the camera it's a bow the little rain boy oh that's a beautiful nice little fish right there Antonio took the row bag took the reel well we didn't have too bad of a day coming here for a little time like so a nice brown trout a nice little rainbow had one other bite but we just couldn't entice the salmon to fighting and like I say they typically not on the on the bite right now this time of year but it sure would have been nice to in face intubating but i got to tell you what a relaxed will night an hour and change out here on the water absolutely love it I want to thank you so much for tuning in folks that thundermans fishing tips always nice to spend time with you and that's always until next time good luck ",

        "content": "alright y'all so today give me like a lot of requests we're going into the fall season and speckled trout is heating up so I figured I want to do a tutorial for y'all today on how to catch speckled trout and actually not just talking about it but doing it as I'm catching it and today what we're gonna be using is just a standard jig head with a plastic lure and I'll show you guys all this throughout the video but hopefully this tutorial this video will get you guys stoked on catching speckled trout and teaching you guys on how to maximize catching as much of them because the speckled trout are a blast if you all have like a kid you got a girlfriend a wife you have someone who you want to get into fishing and maybe they like don't even want to fish like artificial lures this speckle trout fishing when you get into a school and you're able to locate them and you're you know doing it the correct way you can just anybody can catch the speckled trout and it's a blast so that being said I'm gonna stop talking and we're gonna start catching some fish so stay tuned guys how to catch [Music] alright y'all so when you're catching speckled trout first thing you want to do is you've got to have wet hands so after you all wet your hands so you want to make sure that your lure is sitting flush on your jig head like so you don't want it all bent up and Brett's on a fish little guy and so for speckled trout fishing it's actually more of like locating the fish but so yeah once you once you get on them what I like to do is switch to a bait that's more durable it's the z-man shrimp and I've got a 3/8 ounce jig head 20 pound leader line link to 20 pound braid and pretty much all you want to do is just cast it out and let it sink to the bottom and give it a twitch to which keep it off the rocks that's a fish right there and a lot of times they'll come back for it so keep twitching it yeah a little bit more size and that's a that's a decent size trout right there so when you handle these trout again you want to have wet hands because their scales on on these fish well something about it if you have like if your hands aren't wet then it does a lot of damage to these trout y'all can kind of like comment below for known as some of y'all who have a little bit more detailed information about it but just know that you do want to have wet hands when you handle these trout and you want to handle them very delicately these trout are in the same school the same class of actually read of redfish drum black drum red drum and you'll find the male ones kind of make that drumming noise but that's a awesome awesome fish right there so for all of you guys who really if you have someone like a girlfriend or a you know one of your sons or anything you don't want to get them into fishing speckled trout this is what you want to do so catch these guys non-stop see you buddy that's a good one get that one in the boat I got you listen to him drumming dude that's a really nice fish yeah so there's a beautiful speckled trout that my man Jay right here just hooked up on but what are you using a it's Bertha gulp swimming mullet yeah so the let's see here so the so the shrimp will work also these Berkley Gulp swimming mullets that's what Jay caught this one on quick cool man all right I'll let him go we had a bad trout kill this past year he's good [Laughter] that's right that is awesome all right you guys so trout are a finicky fish and a lot of times you'll get into a school of them and either they'll just go crazy and it's every single cast he'll be catching them and then all of a sudden it'll just turn off the bio just turn it off like what happened so don't let that get your confidence that's just the trout being trout and they'll eat when they want to eat typically on a moving current is you know when when when they'll feed right now we've got an incoming tide so we're just casting right up against these rocks where these trout are coming up and just feeding it so the other thing with trout is they have a nickname for trout as paper mouths that's because the trout their mouth is really like fragile and if you try and like house this fish around and you like rickwaa hook set and you're probably gonna lose the fish another small one yeah so depending on how often you are catching them probably once it one one every three fish you want to rewetting hands see you dude so the general technique for working these soft plastics is you just cast it out let it go to the bottom and you're just popping and see how slow I'm reeling just letting it on the bottom and you're kind of imitating a serious that's you kind of imitating a shrimp that's like struggling on the bottom it's a meal that these trout cannot resist so just some other fun facts about trout you really want to look at jetties inlets fish grass lines are excellent running right towards me jetties grass lines structure the speckled trout do prefer a higher salinity than their counterparts of the redfish so if you get a big old rainstorm then you might want to think about if you're targeting speckled trout going to an area that's not gonna have a lot of rain and runoff also I was switching out my battery my GoPro and Jay hooked up on this massive speckled trout this is what Blair Wiggins would call a Mogan speckled trout I hold that thing up that is a beaut oh that's awesome we're gonna give this fish a nice release but shout out to Jay over here that's that is a nice speckled trout that's biggest fish I caught this year is it Yeah right on anyway there you go I can tell what city yes I want you guys cast out you're gonna cast out to the structure to the grass line or to the rocks and you know again just a slow real and then pop slow real pop you do not want to host these fish you want to set the hook but not a bill dance like best you know crazy you know lunker's TV best hook set biggest thing with trout is you want to keep that line tight don't you the trout you get a lot of head shakes so you catch that big one you don't want to lose him if you are like reeling in and then your line goes slack he's gonna do a head shake and then he's gonna throw your hook so in the fall you guys shrimp and swimming mullet are gonna be you know mullets always gonna be one of the best types of bait that you can use for speckled trout there we go right off the rocks but this time of year in the fall the redfish and the speckled trout are definitely gorging themselves on shrimp so thank ya so as I was thank you guys so shrimp with the shrimp part definitely one of the top baits that you all want to use this time of year mullet you can never go wrong with mullet even the mirror lures as a fish [Music] alright y'all so you know again some other places that you all want to look for these speckled trout yeah as I was saying these rock jetties oh that was a fish you know grass lines excellent you know anywhere that you're gonna have like baitfish coming in and out mullets kind of they're like number one choice of food there so that's why like if you're if you're catching like small speckled trout and you want to catch the bigger one then do not be afraid to upsize your lure size some of these speckled trout are eating you know full size mullet that are about this big right here so that's where you know you definitely don't be afraid to you know go up and a bigger size lure I'm just throwing the shrimp right now just to give you guys some fish catching kind of content and some tips here not really that's a good one not really going for the real big one per se trout will also be in anywhere from really really shallow water when you know one to two feet to even some of the deeper areas off of these rock jetties is where they're all kind of staged in the wintertime when you're you know catching the trout the water gets cooler then that's where you're gonna move to the backs of these inlets and the trout just like the redfish they're gonna come up on the flats and they're gonna get that Sun you know if that tide you know kind of coming in but yeah you know again you guys just seriously like you got someone that you want to get into fishing or you need a confidence booster for fishing and get on these speckled trout [Music] turning right towards the boat come in here oh yeah you know that's about the average kind of small-sized speckled trout that you're gonna find we did have a really bad fish kill where we're fishing in Virginia North Carolina is you know where I mainly fish out of so we did have a bad fish kill you know it's past year but it's it's this is a good sign that we're seeing that you know numbers of trout so some other things y'all can do if you're catching the small ones if you find this main school let's say like right here you can cast to the sides of it because so these trout will stack up hill school up actually bluefish will tear up speckled trout so this speckled trout when they're younger they get into these schools which again is great for catching and catching quantity but when you want to catch the quality than the bigger speckle trout tend to hang out more on their own so once they get to that size probably about above that like 17 inches is when you're gonna start to you know see this speckled trout be a little bit more kind of on their own and they're not gonna really you know be with the school not to say that well look at that not to say that you won't catch big speckled trout within the school but if you're really targeting the big one then use the bigger bait he's a bigger lure you can even use like fresh like live mullet pen fish even spot croaker almost the same type of bait you'd use for catching big Reds is what you know you can still use to catch these speckled trout that are 20 inches same it's really the same bait you would use to catch like a 40 inch red so yeah this the live mullet live pen fish those ones are all excellent choices for live bait ooh come on in here another fun sized speckled trout yes another thing about trout is they have a very strong I guess what you would call like their shoulders and a lot of muscles up in here which is why you get some really really good head shakes so definitely want to keep that line nice and tight the whole time yeah dang you hit it on the fall these guys are like hungrier now here let me uh hold on before you throw that went back and this is a good one that's a bigger there's about inch nice alright y'all so that right there concludes the tutorial on how to catch the speckled trout so dude I've stoked for you to come out here man I could just catch these fish all day long ",

        "content": "hello everyone have a look at this beautiful string it's very very high it's carrying a lot of water as a result of recent rainfall so now is a great time to fish for trout using worms for bait because the ground is so saturated is going to be worms everywhere now I'll get a lot of questions and lately the questions I've been asked I've been hooked size sinker size and weather or sit in one spot will move so I want to try and answer a few of those questions for you right now here I have three split shot sinkers on my line may be able to see that camouflage with my dirty hand there are three split shot sinkers there and the hook which i think is a size 10 but I could be wrong I get a little bit confused about sizes I'm pretty sure that was a 10 but anyway I don't go much on fancy numbers it's a hook that big it's a centimeter and a half long and it's got a gap about not quite a centimeter wide sinker size the higher the water the bigger the sinker needs to be I work along the lines of I like to use the smallest sinker that I can get away with on the day if the water is lower and the current wasn't as strong I'd only use two split shot if the water is even lower again I'd use no split shot and if I could I would fish with a bunch of worms totally unweighted the problem is with the water being so high without a weight if I discussed the one out there unweighted by the time it sinks to the bottom it's going to be right down there about 150 meters I reckon I want it down the bottom in there in which case have probably got to cast way out there beneath one to sink down so what I want to do is put a weight on that's going to put it down and hold it there against the current I'm going to go with three split shot sinkers here two days ago in the season open dollars up here I was using a ball sinker because there was just so much water around so basically rule of thumb use the lighter sinker you can get away with with the conditions and I think these three little split shots I think they're bb's in size I think that they three of them will be a bit light but I would rather be a little bit light on that a bit heavy I've crimp them on the line about 30 centimeters up from my hook nothing fancy no running sinkers nice two rigs nuts or anything just use whatever not ties the hook onto the line cream three split shots on about 30 centimeters up and they're ready to go with the worms some people want to thread the worm under the hook and just use one worm or just simply poke it through poke it through again just keep poking it through so there's plenty of wire on the hook this worm hasn't actually got a lot of guts he's not like me yeah I just dug these worms up there neither car on the property under some cowpats my hands are so dirty they covered in cow look at that that's looking good I like to leave a tail or two if I can just say that might wiggle in the current attractive features of the trout's attention a little bit better some going three split shot 30 centimeter dropper and a bunch of worms now some people ask me whether or not I sit in one spot or do I just walk up drifting through the holes that is largely dependent on the current because there is so much water in here today I will probably give each hole a significant amount more time than what I usually would usually I drift the worm into a hole like that for about 30 or 40 seconds maybe a minute then I'd move but I'm probably going to sit here for 10 or 15 minutes before I move on upstream to the next hole because the water is so high I think the fish will be moving around they won't I'll be sitting in one spot I'm just going to cast this just there that need to cast it across the creek all I want to be able to do is see my line and I can see that I'm just going to sit here relax and watch Mike get a bite straight away might take 15 minutes I might get one at all one thing I do know is that when the water is this high trout will be feeding on worms because all of the little gullies running out of these hills are flooded the worms are coming to the surface and getting washed into the system buddy is guys a nice fish too yeah I just made a small little cast in there a tiny little cast in there and just set it near my feet just off the current and I wrecked little rewards with that magnificent brown trout on the bunch of wounds have a look at that his follow that hook a bit deep I don't want to give him any more stress and he's already got so I'm going to put that in there yeah a few guys here little Ripper Oh y'all I can smell a smell of nice small strain Brown trap I can smell them in this hole I am sure I can absolutely beautiful bit of water yeah it's fascinating looking these streams change year after year a few years ago this was a big deep hole the creeks years ago the creek is to go over there now it only flows there when it's flooded a really high lock right now once this water drops four or five inches that will stop flowing cut through there in the 2010 floods either bite is about got it and if I look any little bloke I knew that to be one there right rip hooks which is guys Gooden wet my hand magnificent beautiful little brown trout I put him straight back in minimize minimize see someone out of the water sitting here watching your rod nibble must pull the line a little moved along the bottom just make it look a bit alive maybe it wasn't evil cuz there he is you know can I catch it feature better than get nothing fat bum you bring is nibbling nibbling tape it tape it it's might be a little one there is little boy got him haha oh oh dear look at that Wow there's a little one he has swallowed the hook it is great to see small crap like that in the screen and with all this water around they will grow very big very quick if they don't get eaten by the larger fish that trout was probably out of the water for about 10 seconds at the most sadly even a fish that size is capable of swallowing a hook I'm using a reasonable size hook here mini a bait fishing the rule of thumb is and it is a rule of thumb it's not always true a smaller hooks generally tend to have the better hook ups you get in your hook more fish with smaller hooks then what you do with larger hooks in saying that the larger hooks will hold the fish better you'll lose less fish with bigger hooks so you don't get the hook ups as easily with the larger hooks but when you do get the hook ups I usually stay stuck a lot more than what the smaller hook to do I'll try to find something like I have today that's not too big and not too small getting a bit of a nibble again now line is quark on the steep I definitely had a nibble down there then even though my line got caught on that fork shaped stick when I pulled it up I would have pulled the bait well away from that fish that's okay because if it's actively feeding in that area he will find it again your guys you found it again soon as I started moving that tap-tap-tap I went to put the rod back up here on the stick and cut that back yes I'm suspecting if I have another really small trap of my hands here hyah the pidgeys small got him goodness me look if I look at the size of that Wow that has made my day if he goes did you see that self-releasing he's just done me a favor I didn't even have to touch that fish that my net brand trail was probably 4 inches long I will be honest I don't know whether that was this year's spawn or last year spawn I'd say last year's but what I do know is a trap I one of the fastest growing fish in Victoria one of the fastest growing freshwater fish right up there the European carp that little trout has the potential to grow to be 2 kilograms by this time next year it probably won't that's just the potential but realistically that fish could be given the fact that I've got such wet conditions at the moment there's a lot of food in the system I would expect that fish to be 30 to 40 centimetres in the next 12 to 18 months and probably three pound within two or three years unbelievable I'm loving the fact that I've now seen two little small trout come out of this one little pool - fantastic he's gone was one of those bites where the line never actually pulled tight I wet my hands it's one of those bites where the Fisher's grab the hook grab the bait and swim towards me come on II missed that well had a medium-sized brown tree out of around about 23 or 24 centimeters but we'll get you back in the drink here he goes it was one of those bites sometimes the rod doesn't have to move to get a bite I was watching the line it was just getting limpa and limpa limp a little slack slack slack what's happened the trout has grabbed the worms and then started moving back towards me so I reel in all the slack and then found the fish will commence me up just under that Tussey love it turning up I think that there's more than one fishing it all beautiful little backwater sort of hole dreams are made of it like women lock myself libel definitely more definitely boss he he's bought movies Barton it just nibbles come on take him take him golly haha neither be a second fish in his holes be big in the last violent gonna be more couriers corner it's now now certainly putting on a fair bit more of a performance in the last one that he's coming back three and a bloody snag or something just I think the fish is still here but I don't really want to yeah it's starting to kick fancy being snagged by a body dirty old trout idea oh he's gone no longer can I feel the kicks he still there I can see him I could actually see a big guy ah there is the lad he's got me wrapped around that tree I don't miss no you come here yeah not doing anyone any favors by doing silly things like that might lovely brown trout of around 32 to 33 centimetres wrapped around this branch well that beautiful see you buddy ",

        "content": "hey guys going to show you a quick simple setup for a Carolina rig I used it yesterday to catch a trial at foster you're going to need a sinker bead swivel and a number 10 hook and I was using a six pound test line I use a three-quarter ounce a little bit heavy but yesterday was really windy and my line was boat in the wind so it's dragging my sinker so I use a 3/4 ounce to help it hold it down on the ground more so it doesn't move alright so first thing you want to do is that's your main line there let's say hook it through the sinker it doesn't matter which way you hook it through just hook it right through there and a B so there you have it and then to your swivel okay I'm just going to tie a really quick uni knot okay so there is your sinker bead and swivel so this is going to slide all right now you have your leader let's go with this one right here okay first let's just tie on the hook all right just going to do a really quick uni not again just going to do three turns only this is a demonstration only so it doesn't really matter alright so for moto line you always want to make sure you wet your line because a mono is very sensitive to friction and it'll warp if you don't win it okay so there's your leader now you tie your leader on to the swivel the leader yesterday I was using about a three-foot leader because Foster reservoir is pretty deep reservoir and I tend to use longer liters when I'm fishing deep water um that way you know it stays in a strike zone just really simple not here I do not in a separate video cut off the tag in okay so there you have it so you have your hook and then your leader here just for demonstration it's about probably 13 14 inches and then your swivel beat and wait so that's what I was using again if if you're fishing you have to adjust the leader according to the depth that you're fishing it if the water you're fishing is about two feet you know maybe use about a 1 foot clear so that way it just is suspended halfway ok PowerBait my favorite color chartreuse works really well a lot of people like it and quite effective now the color that works is a lemon line and rainbow rainbow also works well so these are my three favorite colors which are Troost rainbow power bait and lemon line power of a you eat the dough flies up very easily when you cast so I recommend the power eggs so to put them on yesterday I was using to power eggs you can use one if you want but I just prefer to so it stays really boiling it stays float you know way above the ground so when you hook it through just hook it to the side don't go in the middle because it'll bear your hook and you won't get a good hook set so go to the side a little bit and you want that hope to be exposed just like that so once I hope to dispose when that fish takes it it's going to hook them right away you get a good hook set now if you use only one if you use one that's fine - nothing wrong with that but the longer your leader the more weight is going to drag so it's going to so you need a lot more buoyancy so one egg might not be able to float that line so that's why I use two so anyways if you use one egg don't hook it in the middle like that because as you can see it's just not enough hook there to get a good hook set so you just want to go on the side a little bit just like that see now your hook is a little bit more exposed so that way you get a good hook set solid hook set alright and here is the video thanks for watching guys there's one like a little guy pretty good-sized pretty green back - oh yeah really good size curious like another one this one's on a chart crease got stuck on that log come on Darius came off right there really nice size - there's another one got him on the orange PowerBait again not the orange see a rainbow rainbow power base I put two on there because I want to float way off the bottom so this is number three oh actually is number two on the orange power base sorry Rainbow Power Bait keep on seeing orange I don't know why you swallowed it all right there it is the rainbow power bait usually I'd release them but this time I'm gonna keep them there's one more I didn't realize I had him on I wanted to reel up my line to check it and he got on that's cool so this would be number four this is the chart truth table array right there there he is he's good size these are pretty good size for a stock trout there is the good size yeah let me see oh there he is yeah you took it there is she's about 13 I think 13 inches nice looking fish again on a simple PowerBait rig set up there yes there's another one I got the bell on so it round not crazy come here baby that would be number five for me this is on the I believe the lemon line cartoons lemon line all right I got to take that Bell off that's really annoying there we go that's good sighs there he is now that's a fighter wow he's a really good size he's about right thirteen again right there so lemon-lime PowerBait see that and he took it pretty deep too which is okay because I'm going to keep them there he is here's a good one there's going this is on the chart truth power bait again pretty good size there he is put a stalker yeah it's good size ",

        "content": "hi doing guys Malik over at modern pawn today we're going to be talking about croaker fishing it's springtime those big styles are running through the grass flats and the croaker are in season down here in South Texas there's croaker at the bait stand if you guys have never fished croaker it is a different way of fishing from what we normally do the majority of the year but it is it's pretty fun and you have a chance of catching some really big trout so I'm talking some some big logs and big big 30-inch trout are normally caught on on live croaker and we're going to go over some of the reasons why we fish croaker why the trout hit croaker and the way in which we catch him looking fish croaker fish undisclosed location the first thing we're going to talk about is why fish a live croaker a live croaker is not just a food source for trout it's not like fishing a dead cut bait a live shrimp or anything like that I mean cut crab any of those kinds of things that people fish for inshore species the croaker is a natural enemy to the trout especially large female spawning trout what happens is those big trout in the springtime will swim up into shallow grass flats they'll swim up from deeper water into a grassy transition to spawn and what they're doing is they're they're going in there they're interested in finding a spot to lay their eggs they're not in there gorging on finger mullet they're not in there looking for shrimp they're not feeding per se now they do eat obviously but they're in there to spawn take it easy big girl croaker are natural enemies to the trowel they eat trout eggs female trout know this if a female trout is in a grass flat looking for a place to spawn or she's currently spawning putting eggs here putting eggs there and she here's a trap she hears a croaker making his little croaker noise that's why we call him a croaker it's cuz they grunt they make a little grunting croaker noise if she hears that she will come to that fish they will bite that fish that will grab ahold of that fish if they're hungry or if they're not hungry it really is almost irrelevant if they're feeding or not they're in there to drop those eggs and they're protecting those eggs so the croaker bite on it from a trowel is generally a defensive bite not necessarily an opportunistic feeding bite there's a type of hook called a croaker hook a lot of companies when you buy it on the package it actually says croaker hook it's also called a kale hook kale with a K I think this is a 4 OTT I've seen them 3 out of 4 out 5 off all the way up to a 6 on we I will carry a couple of different size croaker hook depending on how big the average Coker is that we get from the baits and sometimes you get these croaker and they're they're like six six inch croaker and sometimes you get them in there 2 inch croaker so we normally size this style of hook to the appropriate size croaker that are in the live well sometimes you get a mixed bag the for our croaker hook seems to work cover everything cover all our bases I generally throw thirty pound fluorocarbon I might throw 40 pound fluorocarbon if I feel like there's some extra oyster eat oysters in the bottom or are some instructions or I feel like I might get to start getting a braided on my tie on 40 pound fluorocarbon but generally thirty pound fluorocarbon is what we use these are here are just basic egg weights sliding egg weights these are faceted glass beads you don't have to necessarily get the faceted ones you don't necessarily have to get red really what you want is just glass beads and what we use these beads with in conjunction with the egg weights is a it helps the egg way from slipping over the knot and B it provides a little bit of a click clicking noise the other thing that we will throw or we're called chatter weights and what these are are they're weighted they're not ultra super heavy like an open lead egg but they are weighted and they have a rattle in them some of them rattle a little more than others and I have a couple of different sizes all the way up to some some bigger ones like this and what this does is again we're drawing attention to where our Croker are as also a weight helps bring that croaker down to the bottom it helps keep your bait in place if there's any current there's any wind so this this generally we can you use a combination of any of this bait sometimes we'll throw a small chatter and a small egg weight chatter only any weight only just kind of depends on how much current we have pulling through there how thick the grass is as well what I did was I tied my suffix braid to a chatter wait I don't know if you can hear that chatter wait then I tied for carbon and I put about maybe six inches on this one with a sliding egg weight and a glass bead and the glass bead in this situation is really just to keep my egg weight from sliding that far forward all the way to the hook and when I have here I put a nail knot in the middle that this this egg weight stops on that bead on that on that nail knot and so there is a little bit of movement of the egg weight this one's about maybe twenty four inches of the thirty pound fluorocarbon and and then we had the hook tied on to the end about the anal fin right below the lateral line on a croaker hook and that's what you want right there little little egg weight spinning rails versus bait casters both can work both have their advantages spinning reels we use spinning rails and bait casters there's another type of reel that's the that it's kind of a blend of the two it's called a bait runner spinning reel it's a spinning reel that has a bait runner function on it the real advantage to bait casters is the fact that you could open the spool very quick and easy with the push of the thumb button opening of the spool what that does is it allows that trout to take the croaker you could push that button and the line will peal out with little almost no resistance and then as soon as you're ready to set the hook all you have to do is click it and you're fighting the fish spinning rails to get the same kind of effect you generally have to open the bail you open the bail let the fish take the the line then you got to either flip the bail over manually or if you have a reel where you can just turn the handle and then we'll close the bail automatically the third type of reel is a bait casting spinning reel or a bait runner style spinning reel and what this is it's basically a standard spinning reel has your drag up here but it has a second drag system right here and it's a bait running drag system when you do with this as you flip this guy off now the line comes out very easily and you have some control over it down here on how much drag is on the secondary drag so you can keep the bail closed while the fish is taking your bait and as soon as you go to turn the handle it disengages the light drag Andry engages the stiff drag and now you're back to your six pounds of drag or whatever you're running on the reel so there's there's a few different ways of doing it but the way that we catch the the Croke with the trout on the croaker is the same every time okay guys we're going to mock up for you like we're catching we're catching fish on croaker basically you're going to cast the rod as soon as that croaker hits the water you're going to leave the spool open for a second let them get down to the bottom let them get oriented you're going to let them make sure that there's actual slack in the line so there's all the way down that he's oriented as soon as he's as soon as you give him maybe a five count you're going to click the bail and you're going to real up until there you feel that there's just light tension in the line if you get good croaker from the based and they're still going to be lively you'll be able to feel I'm just kind of jiggling on there they'll be wiggling their tail that's what you want once we have them in that position I'm going to let out a lot offline so that my rod tip is relatively straight up and down I don't want my rod tip out pointed towards the fish I want it real high almost at a 12 o'clock position okay what you're going to do from this point what we do is we keep the bail open so we keep the spool in the in the click position we keep it here and I leave my thumb on the reel to have some sensitivity from this point what we're going to do it just on occasion I'm talking maybe every 60 seconds is give that croaker a little don't thump-thump-thump wake him up make sure he's that he's not grassed up make sure there's a bait there see if I can feel them swimming what's going to happen when you feel that croaker get hit by the trout you're going to feel it bolt you're going to feel like a little bump up as soon as you feel it what we do we drop the rod and we let our finger off the spool okay and what you're going to see is that trout is going to start peeling that line off they're going to start taking it and you're going to want to just go bill dance on them that's not what you want to do the instinct is just to jerk back work hard on it what I see guys do is they as soon as they feel that bump they weigh em they slam and turn rip that trout's head off all you're going to do is pull the croaker out of the trout's mouth what that trout is doing he's biting that croaker normally on the belly or the back and he's going to swim and then he's going to move the croaker around until he gets a head first and eat it so you got to give them some time and and sometimes you need to give them lots of time I've had times where the guys that were given like ten counts we're catching the fish and then sometimes you know you dill they're picking them up and they're swallowing on them real fast you'll know because they'll take off real hot and heavy and even if you give them a little line you'll still catch them so you're going to let them take that five count off there then what we're going to do is we're going to click the bail and just lift up and they should be on there because if he's pulling line there's tension on that line so I don't need to I don't need that wham and slamming real hard all you're going to do is if they don't have it properly positioned in their mouth is that you're just going to jerk it away from them now sometimes on the when you click it and lift up you'll feel it go boom and it'll pop out of their mouth what do I do I immediately drop the raw tip again because that trout is now still sitting right there by that croaker he there's many many times they'll come right back and pick it up again so if you feel it again they picked it up again let them out let them take that line give them a good 10 count click it over and then just set the hook like that and you'll you won't if you're on the boat with those fishing you won't see us when falling off the side of the boat trying to set these fish as hard as we can it doesn't take a ton of pressure to set that hook remember when you look at that barb you only got to move that bar that far for it to get set so it doesn't need to you don't need to jerk that hard on it now if you're running monofilament you got to set it a little harder because all that stretch in that line isn't going to transfer to that fish until you get a good Bend in that rod with the braid you don't need that hard set you're a lot easier to get the advantage of the bait caster with the fact that you have control over opening and closing the free spool with the click of the thumb with the spinning reel what we do a lot of times if I think I'm in a good position on that croaker I'll open the bail and I will hold it with my thumb and as soon as I feel that hit that thumb I'm gonna let it down make sure he's taken it then I can open my finger he could take it as soon as I think he's ready I'll just close the bail and again pull just pull back up to the 12 o'clock position and start reeling I don't need a slamming real hard the other thing is a lot of times you'll cast it out there you're messing with the line or you know you're you're doing a shake or something like that and all of a sudden you feel that bump if I drop that rod tip he he gets a good seven feet of line six feet of line he's got lined just for if I keep my raw in a good straight up position he gets that and it'll give me time to open my bail let him take some line then I can close it again set my hook okay third type of reel a bait running spinning reel again cast it out give it a little bump bump once you're you think you're in position what I have the advantage with this reel is I can click this and then I can almost with no it's almost no pressure pulling it out there and it's not even a pound of drag they could very easily pull out the line and I have control over how much drag I give them based on this knob down here this is the Shimano tunas 4000 to fog good she still looks nice and lively come on look still she looks still strong good job bar high good job ",

        "content": "I felt like a pretty bit better fish hey what's up guys Nick the informative fishermen here and today I'm going to be doing a video on beginner bait fishing for trout I'm gonna show you the most simplest method to get started out there on any leg summer winter fall spring you name it to go catch trout and a lot of people are going to show you elaborate methods for catching them and you know myself I'm a professional angler a multiple to two species you know I'm cash checks and many of them but I'm going to show you the most simplest form to get it done with first of all if you've never fished before check out my video on introduction to fishing and that's going to help you out a little bit more I have a spinning reel basics video out there you can check out as well and rod action meaning understanding why your rod bends how long it bends how far back it bends you know so you get a better understanding of those now first off what we're going to talk about when it comes to trout fishing is there's a variety of trout out there you have mixed breeds of trout's but most stock trout in lakes are rainbow trout you know there's a few different types but generally you fish for them all the same way so what we're going to start off with is the rod and reel basically all you need is a spinning rod and a spinning rod and a spinning reel and if you see this little wire here the bail on the reel this is your spinning reel and your spinning rod generally has the bigger eye closer down to the reel minute tapers off towards the tip you can use any rod from six foot and length out to nine foot in length it doesn't really matter if you're bank fishing the advantage you get over a longer rod as you have more leverage when you pick it up it's going to fasten that line and put the hook on the fish faster because you're moving more line the shorter rod you're moving less line so you have to think about it in that sense when you look at your rod you're going to look at the rating system right down here you want a medium or a medium light rod and when you look at your line class it's going to be right down there it's going to say lure line and it's going to show you a four to twelve pound line six to fifteen generally you want a rod that can handle four to twelve pounds and the basic line we're going to be getting started off with is eight pound test this line right here is copolymer this is a line that's a mixture between fluorocarbon line and monofilament line I'm not going to really get you into that too far right now what you just want to know is you're going to start off with eight pound monofilament line and this is for monofilament is going to be for your winter your spring and your fall and the reason for this is trout are going to be shallow around those times a monofilament line floats so shallow water floating lines not too big of a deal but when we're in the summertime the middle of the summer the trout are going to be moving deeper the Sun gets a higher you have higher ultraviolet days warmer days the trout are going to start moving down deeper along with the baitfish so that's when we're going to start using fluorocarbon line and these are two different lines the monofilament floats and it has stretched the fluorocarbon is almost invisible it has very little stretch and it sinks the reason why we're going to use it in the summer time the fluorocarbon is because we're going to have less big Bo in our line it's not going to be floating up and we're going to feel the bites much better when we're fishing deeper and really far out there so we're getting started with eight pound line in the spring fall or some our winter we're using monofilament in those hotter months from let's say June early June through mid September to late September we're going to be using fluorocarbon line and then we're going to go back to the mono so those are two good choices to work through now what you want to focus on when you get out there I'm going to show you the rig in a minute but what you want to focus on is finding trapped and when I say finding trout what this means is if we go out to any spot on the shoreline and we cast out there realistically we're just hoping we're not finding the fish you know we got to get out there the fish really you know hold at about five percent of the water and that means 95% of the water realistically doesn't have a fish in it so if we have no clue where the fish are guess well we're throwing blindly and we're just hoping that they come along and eat our bait so what we want to focus on when you're just getting started on trout fishing if you go out to the lake and you have the wind blowing in your face you're in a good spot also if you're on one of those spots of the lake where you have a big point that tapers out and wind blowing on it that's even a their spot and the reason for this is the wind blows microorganisms which those little minnows and all the other little crustaceans and stuff in the water feed on and those little minnows and crustaceans are what rainbow trout feed on they feed on minnows they feed on shad crawdads worms grubs anything else the winds going to blow up to that bank so therefore if you're fishing with the wind blowing to your back realistically there's not going to be as many fish in that spot winds blowing in your face you're in a good spot those Lake points that stick out the reason why these are so good is they hold fish year-round because they hold structure there's rocks there's cover there's crawdads there's minnows and the wind always blows from one side or another or straight at it so it's always catching a lot of food therefore holding a lot of life year-round so that's always a good spot to target trout if you find one of those big points sticking out of your lake and I'll tell you exactly why this episode of the informative fisherman is brought to you by never try pulling a planer board next to your boat when trolling or fishing from a swift current bank if not you're missing out on one of the most phenomenal fish catching machines on the market today with Yellowbird planer boards pulling your lines perpendicular to your boat you can't help but catch more fish find out more by visiting www.h ants to fish the baddest hoochie on the market today that's right I'm talking about the Shasta tackle wiggle hoochie one of the most dynamic reaction trout and salmon lures that run second to no other for pulling and triggering fish into striking so I guess the real question is are you catching all the fish you should be catching did you ever wish for an RC boat do you have a passion for fishing but guess what it's time to do it both at the same time with RC fishing robot comms RC fishing pole it's time to be a kid again so visit www.michigan.gov/mstep swai I use P line each and every time are you fishing the best hey have you been to rusty lures calm did you know they offer free shipping on anything over $29.99 and with all the latest and greatest in bass fishing gear from punching tackle umbrella rig swim baits and you name it there's really no reason for you not to be getting the best deal online today so go to WWSD luscom now let's get back to the show so fish in those main Lake points and what I mean by this let's say you get out and you see it sticks out way into the lake you can see the angle on that alright so you can say well I'm an Imagine it's 20 foot deep right about there because you see it dropping down like that the point out into the water you see it coming down here so you see that angle going down so you know it's probably about 20 feet right there probably about 50 feet right there now how does this work to your advantage well in the wintertime the trap will often occupy the top 20 to 5 foot water column mean very shell up in the top so in the wintertime we're going to use our bobber rig and I'm going to show you how to do that in a second here in the summertime the trout often move deeper like I said it's getting hotter they're going to go down deeper and in the summer your trout are often occupying 35 to 75 feet of water so that's pretty deep so by using that point as a visual and fishing right on it you can kind of guesstimate how deep it's going to be and instead of just throwing straight out into the lake where you don't know how deep it is I'll tell you why this is a disadvantage to you we have a thing called thermal clients in the summertime and in the wintertime you could develop a thermic line too this is when the weather stabilizes therefore the colder water pushes down to the top of the lake the warmer and that night right temperatures in the middle well at the bottom that colder water you start losing oxygen plant life dies it goes down there it consumes oxygen therefore the trout won't be hanging down out on the bottom they'll be right in between so by fishing on a point you know you can find that in-between point where those trout are comfortable and feeding not on the very bottom not on the very top so in the summer time points are phenomenal for fishing so let's get into the rigging here all right so the rig that I'm going to be teaching you to float fish and bottom fish is the split shot rig it's extremely versatile and super simple I have my line coming straight off my rod here and this is going to go to a size four hook I use size four and size six for my split shot rig if I'm just getting out there no matter what I'm fishing for what type of trata I'm fishing for this will catch fish if the trout are a little bit bigger on average I'll use the floor if the trout are a little average aren't smaller I'll use the six the numbers get smaller from 1 up to 32 from one backwards it becomes one on to three and they get bigger going that direction but not I'm going to use to tie on my hook is a Palomar knot so I'm going to switch and show you an illustration here and then we'll come back once I have this tied on and you'll be able to check this illustration out and hopefully figure out how to tie yourself all right so now that we have our hook tied on I'm going to show you something see I have a little bit longer shank on this hook and when you're a beginner I suggest using a little longer shank if you don't understand what the part of the hook that I'm talking about please watch my video on a better understanding of fishing hooks so we got that tied on now this is very simple this is just going up our line this here is a split shot see this little guy looks like a little Pacman all we're going to do is go about 18 inches to 24 inches up our line and we're going to squeeze it down on there we're going to cinch it down we can use needle nose pliers our fingers you squeeze it tight with your fingers if you're one of those people that Dennis doesn't like very much you can bite it down that works too now this is beneficial if you're fishing on the bottom and the reason why is you can use a bait that doesn't flow you can cast it out there it'll drop your split shut down and your bait will sit on the bottom we often don't do that with trout fishing when we're fishing on the bottom we use floating bait like the doe baits here this is like your power baits that they float they also have some that sink and sit on the bottom or your egg baits here another thing that these will do is they'll float or sit on the bottom so you want to make sure if you're fishing on the bottom you use ones that float and what that's going to do is it's going to float up just like that and a good way to test to see if you have a big enough split shot or enough split shot is toss it out in the water right in front of you and if your weight is just barely sitting on the bottom like so it's perfect you don't want it floating up off the bottom because you're not going to know where your bait set so you can squeeze another split shot on or you can take one off but as long as your bait is floating just up off the bottom like so it's perfect that trout is a scavenger you have come up you'll eat that thing BAM you ought to be jumping all over the place you can pick it up and set the hook on now here's another cool part about the split shot rig I have a bobber right here and I'm not showing you a slip bobber or anything overly elaborate these type of bobbers this is just like a standard stick bobber the round bobbers you can do it the same way you pull that spring down you put your line right into the clip and you twist it around and that will hold your bobber on to the line now the benefit is you in the Sun in the winter time or the spring time or the fall when the trout are up shallow now can you use that sinking bait the one that doesn't float and toss this up on the surface and that will sink and sit right under that bobber just like so so that split shot will hold it stable and make sure your baits down below that bobber and you can fish you know that upper 5 to 20 foot water column 20 foot leader behind here's a little bit long that's might when you want to start using a slip bobber at that point and I'll teach you how to use that later on but you know a 5 foot leader is doable and you can cast it out there and fish under the bobber and those colder months when those trout are up searching around shallow you know those summer months when those trout are deeper you can pop that off use your switch back to your floating bait and get that down there look at the grass on the bottom if you have grass it looks like it's about two foot tall make sure you set your split shot further down the line to where your bait floats up and above it so when it comes to choosing your bait how I told you the floating baits you know your power baits your your P line makes good floating baits as well for trout there's a whole variety of stuff out there there's salmon eggs which is a very common one these are your salmon eggs the little red eggs that come in the jar like so then you have you can do sweet corn you can get canned sweet corn and this is a really cool trick but you have to check with some of your links it might be illegal to use corn in your leg when you get a little jar of minced garlic and sweet corn you pour them into a sandwich baggie soak them in there trout love that you want to float that under a bobber I guarantee you they'll eat it you know your salmon aids your power baits you're floating baits you little soft egg baits trout love this stuff so they'll eat it up so if you get out there you know and you're wondering where they're at let's say it's the spring or the fall and you're wondering if they're still deep we're still shallow you know bring 2 rods out there get a dual rods dam fish one on the bottom and fish one under a flow fish the split shot rig on both you know and you'll find them in no time jump around through your baits you fish a spot for over 30 minutes and you don't catch a fish look for another spot where the wind's blowing your face or point out there where the winds blowing food into their cast out to that thing and fish there if you're having a problem you see your line drifting across the water that means you don't have enough weight so add another split shot and then your line will stop drifting around if it's very windy you might have a tough time with a bobber so a good thing to know at that point is cast up there let it drift across that's also presenting the bait to those fish at the same time so don't get frustrated that it's moving the whole time pick up cast let it blow across again trout are often cruising around looking for food so use that wind to your advantage it's going to drift it right across there and troll that food right through there for you so play with your depth and go up and down off the bottom I'll play with your dip off a bobber go deeper go shallower and try different baits until you get bit once you figure out what works I guarantee you there's going to be other trout there and you won't have any problem filling up your bag to take home for a killer dinner I'm Nick the informative fisherman and we'll see you next time

        "category": "Sports and Fitness",
        "content": "I'm at the Patapsco River Daniel's Dam and today I'll be teaching you how to catch trout from a river or Creek just like bass fishing when I'm fishing for trout I like to start with a moving bait right now I'm using a panther martin in-line spinner and i could cover some water just to see what kind of mood the fish are in when looking for a prime trout water you always want to look for deeper slower moving water right after fast shallow water so right here we have some fast shallow water some riffles and a moves downstream right into this deep slow pool right here and this kind of area is exactly where I like to stack up and just wait for food to get washed by I think ambush it and they won't have to spend a lot of energy sitting in these deeper pools how I like to fish a deep pool like this is the cast of bait out and slowly retrieve it with the current for a nice natural presentation and the nice thing about a spot like this is if you catch one or two trout you can come back later in the day and a lot of times it'll reload of a couple more fish there's one all right oh nice trout they're just moving downstream from the dam fishing our riffles right there there's a slow a pool coming right through here because it's beautiful trout so if you guys in a catch-and-release trout like this you want to make sure you wet your hands before handling it this guy's really aggressive Oh quick release that made it easy oh there we go that's about I don't even see him using water right there is chilling it's about a 13 inch trout but Gottman spinning just slow retrieve right across the current came up and nailed it so we just got that trout what I'm doing is just like I pointed out that slow pull head I'm doing the same thing I'm finding these riffles I'm fishing the slow pool of water that I'm moving on so there's some riffles right there I'm going to hit that slow pull after it I'll just keep working my way down and looking for those fish hanging in those slower pools look in the feed I'm exploring the area a little bit and right now all I'm seeing is a lot of flat water not moving very fast very shallow so I'm thinking this unless I find some deep holes I'm probably just going to stop exploring down the river and go back up to the dam and show you guys how to catch us and try to empower bait there's one I told you God that catch one out of here came back throwing a little blade bait beautiful cow go ahead and dip my hand in the water beautiful rainbow right here oh there it goes quick release again see if I get my hand on it check this out got him that's how we noodle rainbow trout beautiful trout right here beautiful colors got them on the de Mickey vault quarter ounce blade bait imitate a minnow oh all right there goes when all else fails I go to power bait never lets me down just how I like the Ridgid a little split shot about a 10 inch leader 6 to 10 inch leader and today I'm using a side stick hook let's all rig it up so I'll pull out a good amount of bait of dough I'll mold it around the hook try to mold it tight on there because it has a tendency to the slip off just like that and before casting it out one thing I like to do is I like to dip it in the water that kind of coagulates it and helped us down the hook a little better I found so I'm gonna go ahead and cast it is a fighter off my line he's on there whatever up out of you got to see the spiders all over my rod right now go away I love this trick I think all right so you want to cast it as close as you can to them sound perfect right underneath it letting all the way to the bottom on a pretty much slack line then once they hit the bottom reel up the slack and just keep your eye on the line keep your pay attention because the fights can be really light sometimes sometimes you won't feel them at all and usually if I don't get a bite within a one two minutes I'll reel it in and make another cast when fishing with power be one of the key things remember is you want to use enough weight in the split shot be able to cast your bait under the ball but you don't want to use too much because then you'll be more likely to get snagged underneath a rock or something like that and if you guys enjoy the tips in this video be sure to read the video description in this video and all my other one because I include a lot of additional information that could help you guys catch more fish let's go over some of my favorite bait I like to use without fishing I know when we start the day off with an inline spinner something like one of these Panther Martins my favorite color silver and gold occasionally I'll mix it up with something like a rooster tail in a more colorful pattern next up are the middle invitations I like to use small jerkbait or a small crankbait this is a neck strap this is a striking series of one I think when I'm going for a bigger bite or fishing murkier condition I'll usually pull something like this out and one of my favorite bait but one of the more unusual ones I'd say they have blade bait you can fish them in deep water shallow water jig them off the bottom and it's something that a lot of trout fishermen don't throw they like throwing spoons by very rarely see him throw a blade bait so this is something that really produces well for me I like users next up we got plastics shut the trout magnet put on a little jig head and jig it off the bottom you can swim it very good for Clearwater and I didn't pull this one out today but this is kind of same deal as the trout magnet I'll fish it on a small hook size 6 size 8 size 10 with a little split shot he kind of just let it drip naturally with the current and a lot of times I can get a vise on that last up we got a my go-to if all else fails Berkeley power bait natural set I like this yellow color because I feel like it imitates the color of pellets that are shout the farmer a shout at fed so if all else fails go with this but be careful the trout tend to swallow this bait and get gut hooks so if you're planning on catching and releasing the fish I would go with one of the other baits as opposed to this ",

        "content": "Hey look here captain carb commie my boy Tommy here we're catching cleaning and cooking trout all right buddy you ready to go fishing yeah now we go out to West Virginia catch some trout huh Tommy and I headed up to mountain meadow farms in sure West Virginia I'll put a link in the description to see more about this location Tommy was super excited he loves catching Troutman so I got this little ultralight set up for him it's a 13 foot ultralight you can use it like a cane pole because it's so long but it's super light and easy for him to handle and I've got a number 8 hook little Eagle Claw under a bobber with a piece of worm they'll split shot nothing else super basil you got it dog all right there's time he's tried okay put it in the ice well they keep attacking our orange bobber so I think we might try some of this orange power bait well that power baits not doing diddly squat let's go back to earth work yeah that's sick alright Tom let's go to the other pond you don't need to get a fire way the fish look how close they are Oh see anyone go you know why you got what you got what I need to be here well Tommy there you go you concentrate look at the camera all right Tom you want to put them in the bucket go ahead and put them in the bucket good job buddy that's number two nice big piece of worm like that seems to be working good with these more aggressive fish usually I go for a smaller piece but this large piece seems to be working really well these little pay to fish private ponds are great for taking kids to fish Tommy loves us because he can do it on his own and he would rather catch these little trout than 30 pound catfish because he gets to do it on his own it's just so much fun fun do you look like a serious trout fisherman there you got trout blood all over your face tell me what bonkers when you discovered you can catch newts in the pond I think that was as exciting or more exciting than the fish how is it cool we never had these in Alaska yes let's love go that's it you take this snail it's right there into peace from snails are awesome underutilized bait we're great for catfish carp trout whatever if you're in a pond like this one that's full of them give it a go the snails here work better than earthworms or the power baby whew good good job huh you're great with that net yeah he chomped down on that snail look at that snail that is the first trout I have caught a long time figure out how much I love catching this guy you can to learn okay come up and show the camera show it to the camera the old it still holds up Wow that's how you kick a friend there I think you go on time you going the other one reel them in get that rod up get the rod tip put the rider way up in the eye whoo that's a big one Tommy mmm that is once the bucket of fish all right we have enough fish I think it's time to quit Tom we have a blast doing this we have the place to ourselves on a Saturday morning we got to feed the fish we got to catch news we caught a buck of the trout and Tommy learned a lot about fishing he got better at casting and fighting the fish and it was just a chance for us to have a great time as father and son in a beautiful location and I'm really glad we went home the time comes our first now that is what I call a message route look at that okay so let me show you how I clean is a trout I simply cut the fish behind the gill plate and then turn the blade 90 degrees and work the blade along the spine from the top of the back to the middle of the belly all the way down across the fillet and then I come back afterwards and trim off any fins that are attached and take the tip of the blade and shave off the ribs that are attached to the flight it salvages a lot of meat it's simple it's a technique I know but if you want to see how an expert does it check this out do one of the owners of mountain meadow farms came and started playing the my fish for me and I pulled out my video camera so so what I do when I fillet a trout I'll show everybody when I'm teaching them that here's the gill plate and it's a real hard bony like structure and if you look this is meat from here all the way up into right behind the head here so you don't want to waste that make your initial cut same angle as the gill plate down to the backbone on the back side down to this color line where you can see where the line color changes down towards the belly of the trout so then what you're going to do is put your knife into the cut the back is going to go first and the belly always trails behind at an angle this part of my knife that I'm touching is going to ride right on that color line right there and as I bring it back as long as the knife makes contact with that color line and the back is down here next to the fin on the back though it's going to get the meat and missed the rib bones when I get to this fin I'm going to straighten my knife out because there's no bones from here back and then just ride the backbone with your knife all the way back to the tail and we're going to cut it off the only thing in this fillet that needs to that needs to be cleaned out right now is the little anal tag right here where the anus is so just take a little pop right there and your fish is clean good to go and you can see it's what neater you have nobody mess do you take the pin bones down on the really big ones not usually don't I usually just take it out after I cook if you get one it's about 16 inches the rib bones or the pin bones are right here and you can feel them you know yeah and on the big one you take your knife and go right alongside of them and make a V you cut all the way down to the skin on that side and all the way down to the skin on this side just a teeny tiny narrow strip then kind of cross it hook it in them to take your finger and go from here down to there and to meet your strips out that's got the pin bones in that's here right here how these filets are kind of got little yellow kind of whitish tint to it that's nice that's natural for a trout a lot of people expect them to look like wild salmon filets and you only get that from eatin in the ocean some some farmers that dieted to the fish food to make them look orange e just because people expected to be orange but this is what a real healthy natural trout fillet should look like I think the most efficient I ever deal in a day with like 750 that was in an eight-hour day it was Memorial weekend and we had both farms rings people fission I like this this Cabela's lane I think it is a really good knife and it's not an overly expensive knife no no nice we've had two of those they've filleted a lot of fish it's not a hologram blade so and I used to convey a sharpener with it to touch them up after each use most of the time you'll be a quick pass through this if you've got a bad spot in the blade and then run over to your stopping blade and run several swipes through it and you're right back to shave and hair off your arm yeah I grew up in Alaska and ate a lot of trout and salmon and halibut in my life and everybody has their own recipe and way of cooking them this is the best this is the simplest this is my favorite okay really easy and I've seen a whole lot fancier recipes and I like this a lot better take one part melted butter 1 part brown sugar mix it up okay super easy then take some tinfoil I need to lay it down onto a barbecue grill or onto a baking pan okay and it's raining cats and dogs so I did this in the oven rather than the barbeque but well how you're doing it lay the tinfoil down put the fillets top side up dry them off so they're not wet and then just smear on this butter and brown sugar mixture on there and be as liberal or as light as you want you're doing it in an oven hit it to about 450 degrees for about 6 minutes that's all you need and if you're on a barbecue you want about a medium heat same amount of time just go and pace that stuff on there get all that little syrup and caramelized sugar on there the skin sticks to the tin foil the meat comes off really cleanly easiest way in the world to cook fish super delicious okay now I'm going to show you how to make smoked trout this is a really easy wonderful recipe okay take a bottle of soy sauce plain old soy sauce put it in that saucepan then take five six hearty chunks of fresh ginger and toss it in there as you bring it up to a boil then you're going to add about half a dozen cloves of garlic doesn't need to be precise eyeball it every time and about Oh cup of sugar for a bottle of soy sauce this size and what I'm doing is I'm making a homemade teriyaki sauce and this is going to be the brine that cures the meat before I smoke it and taste it see how it is if it's a little too tart add some water and bring it up to a boil and once it's boiling for a few minutes that's it you're done cool it off just let that sucker set you want the saw completely cool before you pour it on to me because you don't want it to cook the meat but pour it into a bowl let it sit for a few hours or you can do like what I'm doing and dump the whole mixture into a ziploc bag and throw it in the refrigerator for a couple days till you can get to it I think I let this sit for a day and a half before I had a chance to get the smoker out but this is the part that actually cures the meat that salty teriyaki brine is what cures it and then just drying it out helps preserve it you're not cooking it in a smoker you're simply adding flavor and drying it out that's it so I've got my file cabinet smoker which I made several years ago I've gotten a lot of use out of and I've got some chicken wire here just to keep it off the bottom and this is why I keep the skin and scales on the fillets because that chicken wire is nasty you don't want to be eating food that's been on that so put it skin side down you're not eating the skin anyway so well you can smoke smoked fish on that doesn't have to be all clean but I sat there and smoked it with some hickory chips for 810 hours I think in it because they're such thin fillets they cured up very quickly well just wonderful flavor and smells these suckers but next day before I went to work had about a kilo of of smoked trout to pass around the office of a beautiful delicious food and it lasts a long time in your refrigerator or freezer nice and smoked fish alright so yeah way to you like smoked fish Tommy yeah well if you like that video check out some of our other great videos from the catfish and carp youtube channel we put out new videos every Saturday and Wednesday morning and don't forget to write ",

        "content": "YouTube what is going on kale appear a little more cash TV I'm here to talk about our rig that we're going to use for opening day at route it's coming up next weekend for me and my area here in PA so I wanted to get this video out last weekend but just life got in the way so we're going to get it out for you tonight this rig I'm going to actually use and record my whole trip on opening day so you can see how effective it really is if I had to take one thing with me to the stream you know one particular setup this was what it would be if you want to kind of go out on a budget and not buy a whole bunch of stuff you could buy just the things in this video and definitely catch trout even on the stream or pond or lake doesn't really matter where you're fishing this thing out so we went over line ra's reels all of that stuff in the previous videos if you haven't seen this check them out if you need help with that stuff I will go over how to tie the knot that I used for this hook that I have on here in another video but for now it's called a polymer not so if you want to google it figure out how to use it can do that I prefer it over the clinch knots maybe a few out there that disagree with me but I have the most luck with this not so I pretty much use it until I can't because maybe the Flies get too small or whatever the case may be but for these hooks that we're going to be using for trial you can definitely get away with it so again it's called polymer not check it out I will have a video for it eventually I just don't know what at this time so I left this longer tag end on the line for you so I can kind of show you a lot of guys kind of want to know where you trim it after you've tied it I trim it semi closed but not extremely close just so there's a little bit of slip way there just in case it would slip a little bit so if you can see that too pretty it's cut pretty close but anyway I just figured you might find it useful okay so here's what you're going to need hooks I use Blackbird brand and I'll have all the links in the description for everything that I'm using in this video I use Blackbird brand you don't have to use that you can use whatever you want I like gum got two as well I typically will use the Gammy's on my steelhead trips they're very very strong I don't really necessarily need them for the trout around here but I have them in my box so I probably will use them the sizes that you're looking for are either size twelve fourteen or sixteen probably going to have guys that disagree with me on certain things that's fine everybody likes to use with the they want to use but if it were me and you wanted to go in the store and find the best trout hook look for size 14 I like the salmon egg hooks they tend to curl up in the lip a little bit better so you check them out again that's what I have tied on here is a black bird hook so doesn't have to be that they're a little bit the one the hooks that I use tend to be a little bit more expensive so again it all matters according to your budget so okay so we talked about hooks again I'll put a link in the description below split shot or your weight a couple different sizes I have some here in my box next to me I like the BBS or the B size split shot doesn't really matter kind of get a couple different packs of each again I'll have the links in the description below let's say you guys can check this out horn in my hands you can see the size so you can see the very very easy to pinch onto your line which I will show you here in just a moment bigger ones if you need to get down lower deeper water you put the bigger ones on smaller ones not too much water or I'm going on Saturday which I will be recording for you guys I probably able to get away with just two of these little small ones so where do you put it everybody has their preference I like to come up I don't know and you know 8 to 12 inches up I kind of just doesn't it to be exact just you know figure out close space so prob about that far up for me that's what I like it's all pinch it on here so you can see it just put that on pinched it on boot okay so that's what it looks like now what are we going to be using we're going to be using my favorites and all-time probably highest catching bait PowerBait three inch trout worm from Berkeley fantastic it is bubblegum so you can see that there's a another variation bubblegum something like bubblegum waders on it's strictly bubblegum all pink this or red if you had to pick one over the other go pink so open this pack up so you can see what they look like they're going to come all kind of like together here you can see they give you these little perforated spots you can tear them off at that's it right there that's it that's what we're going to be using seeing of your hook and you're going to be doing what is called a wacky style rig so you're gonna I you can stick it in the fatter part of the worm I typically like to find the middle so I'll put the worm bend it in half here figure out kind of where the middle is to rip out here just pierce it through there one time just like that that's it okay so you've got your hook your worm your first split shot if you want to put more split shot on because that's not enough weight you can kind of go every two three inches up from there you can see I've seen plenty of guys stack it right on top of each other I like to space it out a little bit it's it's really your preference to be completely honest there's no benefit over the over spacing them out like that then the next thing we're going to talk about is your float or if we want to be specific and call what it really is a bobber but we're going to call it a bobber we're going to call a float because it makes us sound better so your float is going to depend on where you put this is going to be based on the depth that you're fishing it you're gonna have to try to get this so that when you throw it in the water let's put this on first these trout floats that I'm using or by trout magnet they're my favorite as far as being cheap and quick and easy they come for in a pack for like a dollar ninety-nine there's these little foam flutes come with this little black peg and just slit on the side you just slide your line right through there put the peg down in the hole it's on BAM okay you can easily adjust this pick up the peg slide it up to where you need to go put it back in you're going to adjust this float so when it's in the water it's going down the stream you're going to see it probably tick every little bit you know and when it's doing that that means it's on the bottom tit and bottom or you have a bite but probably at the bottom so I was going along the stream here it's ticking ticking ticking that's that's usually a good spot that's kind of where I like it to be where it's hitting that bottom every few feet not consistently if it's constantly getting hung up then you're too low come up a little bit bring you float up a little bit more until you've got that nice tick every few feet that's typically going to put you in the sweet spot every time so again I will put all of the items that I have in here in the description below so you can see what they look like so if you wouldn't go online and order them you can if you just want to go to the local store pick them up all you need some floats some split shot some size 14 hooks in this Berkeley PowerBait trout work absolutely killer opening day again like I said it's coming up here next Saturday for me April 16th I'm going to video I'm going to document where I'm going so that if you're in the PA area where you're going to visit PA sometime you can come check out the place that I'm going you'll know exactly how to get there I am going to fish probably two three different streams that day and I'll break it up into that video and show you exactly where all of them are I am NOT going to switch all day from this bait just so you can see how effective this rig is I don't I throw plenty of other different baits all the time I just want you guys to really see how effective just this one set up is it's absolutely killer catch you fish whenever nobody else is if there's another color you want to get two different packs this is another color that I had to say was probably another killer would be the red so red and pink can't go wrong with that if you have any questions comments anything put them below in the comment section be happy to answer any questions you might have there's anything that I didn't go over clearly please let me know and I'll break it down even better in the comments section until next weekend I hope to see you out more water ",

        "content": "hey one is up everybody today we are going to be doing a catch and cook at Green Valley Lake they've been having some monstrous catches out there some giant trout have been caught in these last two weeks so we're gonna try and rush up there I just got off working we're gonna try and get at least one before the Sun sets to do this cut and cook in addition to that we'll be auditioning my brother Jim aka SNF Ron he wants to be doing the butchering and the cooking part of this YouTube channel so hopefully he has what it takes and let's get out there and have some fun get some fish and as always i am dr. pico and welcome back to the wild life all right let's get it guys [Music] all right so if you guys saw last week's video I was at Big Bear that's right down the street and I had a lot of luck with these night color worms so hopefully we have some crazy bites again all rat that's eating [Music] all right so no luck with the worms I'm gonna do a weight with a perfect to float up about 12 inches apart and hopefully they're feeding at that level all right [Music] affectionately smile ruff [Music] [Applause] yeah buddy [Music] oh yeah pretty good site trout good calm down please hurry you down cool right I like to put it in through the kill cut through the mouth courtesy okay she was a non-gay trout all right this guy nervous you prep up because our risk like you're at a job interview look like Tom Cruise man let's get er done all right I see he's starting it out prison style drowsiness the proper technical term would be cool oh let's pronounce cool I spin it all the way up to throw up to take all the inside [Music] see he has experience with this he is a definitely straight what's wrong what I'm serious look in the bad way hey man did you forgot that there's a hook in there okay oh  that's my best ever my bet is that you're gonna be split right so just get that rip the heck out [Music] that's why we brought him home to begin it because he swallowed it so you get anything a lot of baby [Music] he's followed all right [Music] okay so what we're gonna do now is slide the knife right beside the spine pointing out but the thing is we're gonna slide it under the rib cage so that we cut out and separate the rib cage from the actual fillet that we're gonna eat and it's alright if we lose a little meat it's definitely better than then getting a big rib bone stuck in your throat and you want to do that on both sides just cut out and triangle as first farthest as possible so that we get the widest fillet possible both sides [Music] that's the sauce birthday yeah they're all [Music] it's not presentable [Music] that's good there's there's many wanna be at one more place hey Frank [Music] I'll write a writer right so how did you feel about it honestly more breakfast [Music] all right so for your health nuts use a sea salt and that's for me I use garlic salt and C so I probably just put both but you want to put a little bit at a time guys just so you don't overdo it and get our salty fillet this is a little bit of this and just put it on with passion guys everything you do do it with love man just to watch this watch it's like I like to imagine I'm always cooking for Jesus man that's how that's how much passion I want to put into my my stuff yeah [Music] all right so I don't like to cut my lemon all the way through I just slice and twist a little so that I could squeeze all the juice out and none of the seats fall in my stuff but as for the skin side of the truck you guys want to leave it super more especially so it doesn't stick to the the pan which brings me to my next point black pepper black pepper goes on last because that will stick to the pots and pans guys and that's that's hard to wash off for common courtesy for the wife now because she has to clean this mess up and just put it on lightly you know keep it moist moist tune it up guys you want to dry filet either oh you'd like that like that shout out to the wife all right [Music] all right so once you cook the tortilla on the grease if you want the tortilla nice and greasy put the fillet on there then we're gonna add some cilantro our why people say but it's really Samantha wrong with chopped onions just like any other proper way of making a tackle and we're actually gonna do some salsa too but here's what it looks like [Music] how to try it hold it up hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] Etruscan is amazing and conclusion recap we made it to green uh lake we kind of fish within an hour or two we now know what they eat that's a green power of a they were suckers friends they made it like that I had numerous bites and they will actually be stocking mid-october so we'll silver would think so we definitely thought of getting back there and we made it back in time for my brother Jim aka is that mo to gut it he actually got a hook in his hand I don't know if we should give him points or deduct points for that it's actually blood cross-contamination but we still ate the toggles they were bottom they're still good and we got a given points for the recipe those tacos were amazing and if you guys like what you saw let me know in the comments below if you guys think we'll skip to me the boot also let me know in the comments below but there were some people around here that you guys liked the video hit that like button if you

what we're going to be cooking let's get to it so here's the healthy little fatty that we caught today beautiful trout and I'm going to show you how to play this thing really quick first off I'm using the super sharp bubble blade and I leave some pretty good blades guys I think they cost fifty to sixty dollars what you want to do is lift up this pectoral fin go ahead and make a slice straight down till you reach the bone then turn your knife and lay it's almost completely flat on that bone and you just really want to run straight down the back here right down the backbone now you can either stop right here and flip the flay over and then cut the meat off of the skin or you can just go ahead and cut the play completely off like that and that's what I'm going to choose to do today now next what I want to do is go ahead and cut out the stomach lining just like that lay that aside I don't personally eat that but if you're making a soup or something you may want to keep it now what you want to do is hold this with your nail lay your blade flat and go straight down the skin and you can also wiggle the skin with the blade and make the blade do the work just like so all right and that way you get literally every single piece of meat for the most part off of that filet lay that aside and now what I like to do is go ahead and cut out any of the blood lines which there isn't a whole lot in these trout and that will take out allow that fishy case that's a healthy piece of meat laid out aside flip this over and repeat you better be there when I shake watch me working if I can stuff [Music] all right so in order to prepare the the plays what I like to do you can either soak them in milk put them in the refrigerator for about an hour or ice water and lemon and what that will do is to help draw out any of the fishy bloody taste or the blood that's in the meat and it'll make it taste that much better so I got a little small bowl this is only a two nice trout that we kept and put some ice cubes in it I like the colder the better in my opinion go ahead and put your Flay's in the bowl just like so and now I like to go ahead and put some lemon you can put fresh lemon or there's bottled lemon will work just fine and a couple tablespoons and the lemon will also help draw out any of the blood and the fishy taste give it a little bit of Tang when we go to cook it so let's put this in the refrigerator let it soak for a moment we'll get to cook it alright so the first thing I do is I get my big boy pan and you want to use this to go ahead and get your butter melted and you can take about a half a stick of butter that'll be fun cut that place that in your little pan and we're going to put this on our grill do that that's the real deal guys ah [Music] hey everything is always better with butter a lot of butter oh yeah only professionals do this guys Thank You Chef Ramsay and honestly guys this is probably a little excessive you could probably use kind of a quarter of a stick but more the better I guess all right so what I'm going to do is go ahead and Pat my fish dry pull them out of the water and lemon lay them on your paper towel just like so all right then I just quickly Pat them dry guys just to remove any of the excess water off of them all right so now what I like to do it's just crate up a little right thing oh guys where everything is not going to seep out now what I want to do is go ahead and add my Flay's to my aluminum foil and now I just want to drizzle a little bit of my hot butter onto my fish Oh tell me that it doesn't look delish I think that looks really good and you can't leave this guy alone for a minute this is Paul Prudhomme magic seasoning for black and red fish or fish in general use it on chicken as well what you want to do is put a nice coat of black and seasoning on these on this fish and I like a lot you know apply enough to your liking of course but I like that black and taste so now what I like to do is go ahead and flip it over each fillet so after you flip them over go ahead and co2 one outside as well all right simple is one two three guys wrapper up oh boy you know your mouth is watering don't you lie wrap them up just like so all right I'll go ahead and place them in your drill put this down on medium heat give it about four minutes four to five minutes depending on the thickness of those Flay's and you'll be grubbing in till time alright ladies gentlemen so after four or five minutes you're going to have one heck of a delicious meal sprinkle little salt and pepper maybe drizzle a little lemon over it and you're all good to go if you enjoyed this video be sure to give a thumbs up comment below and subscribe you want to see more catching Kooks let me know until next time we'll see you
