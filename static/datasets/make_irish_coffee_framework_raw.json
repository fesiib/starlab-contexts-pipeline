        "content": "hey I'm Jeff Adam fell and where the cocktail dudes so you were making the millionaires Irish coffee sophisticates this is one of those you have to drink with your pinky in the air right no Lanier's don't bring the piggies in there got some of you holding the glass do there that's what I would do if I was annoying there and then you know the napkin oh yeah right after if I'm a user sure feel like we do so this is our souped-up version of the classic Irish coffee minute in the 40s and we're using just kind of premium ingredients pretty much here right definitely we're using the Jameson the rarest vintage reserved whiskey very good which is delicious very complex yes you could use a middleton very rare or some other top shelf Irish whiskey right like top top shot yeah like daddy can you get the key please golden staircase yeah take it to the top top shelf and we're using cream that we have flown in twice a week thing Michigan of all places right Rebecca we're a connoisseur of certain things one of them being cream and it's embarrassing to say that here we are in the dairy state right it's when we have a cow on the back of our quarter for crying out loud or and we're getting everything across the lake you tried we can't ride cream from everywhere in the vicinity and the best one comes from this little hill hof I think they have 12 cows and if we ever become popular they're probably going to hate us because they're going to start getting calls from my Donald Trump them like this is the best Christmas best and spring and summer when they're eating the grass but even year-round it's just something about it that is phenomenal so if creff millionaires would have that and of course we're having as our coffee civet poop coffee right right coffee that's been ingested by these Weasley critters and the South America and pooped out and if someone has to go collective that would be the point the worst right and then I get sucker is up with the states to buy it so that's what we have here and we have the little certificate that tells us the date it was roasted and the day that was harvested right it's just some question about that I don't know if harvested means when it was actually pooped out or when it was picked up yeah not quite sure about that but that takes a little Stevie and so we're gonna do that now right we have our water here just off the boil this is the first time we've ever ever had this in a poop coffee it is may look like millionaires but yeah not even close it smells like coffee not like poop that's always a good sign yeah that sounds very good we're gonna do for rounded tablespoons here in our small little French press I don't know that's probably a hundred dollars really help Jackie about with me hey wait till she gets the B signal right all right there's nothing there for a few were these all right now the civet is like like a weasel writing so the theory behind this coffee is that when they go through their digestive system it somehow digests the way the better parts are something i don't know exactly what the deal is i think it lessens the acidity yeah and like the bitterness to it all right but we're not exactly sure how it works yes but you we just know it makes it taste bad yeah and this is what me if you were in the millionaires pantry you'll probably have boxes of this stuff right exact don't think so all right we're going to let this sit for another three and a half minutes and we'll come back and finish up this cocktail shortly all right we're back we have about a minute left for the coffee so we're going to start by adding our whiskey and our sweetener to the class we're using this riedl venom pork glass perfect class for this thank you we want one and a half ounces of whiskey poor rebel more and then one half house of liquid sugar in the raw you can use sugar cubes and in which case you'd want one to one and a half sugar cubes the benefit of this is that you don't have to stir except for like five seconds exactly whereas if you're using a sugar cube it it's about 15 seconds or 20 seconds even then it doesn't always fully dissolve yeah there we go over those oh alright so now our civet poop coffee is all ready to go we're going to pour that right in there and we're looking for about four ounces we know the about the size of this glass and we're just going to pour to about three quarters of an inch a little bit at the top perfect there you go nice right and then we're having our way I store that a little bit yeah I couldn't get the distributive a little better we're having our kill off cream made by the finest cows in Michigan no no I'm done with the count the cream is darn good we're gonna whisk this for about 15 seconds with our Lottie do you want to whisk it until it's doubled in size right mm-hmm you want to get air in there so that it's light enough to fold on top of the coffee yet trickable drinkable you need it drinkable you can a lot of times the worst thing you can do an Irish coffee is have cream on top you have to eat your way to you know you want something where you get the sweet creaminess the cool then almost instantly followed by the warm fuzziness of the coffee yeah this came in this case of worm losing this with little poop overtones don't you think I can't imagine that good coffee was having a full of poop flavor to it we shall do the same oh all right for the cream right on the top and we're going to dust the top with a little bit of nutmeg and we look for an wine we couldn't find a nutmeg that had been through anyone's digestive right so this is your ordinary nutmeg there you have your millionaires Irish coffee enjoy Cheers you ",

babe and if made correctly this is one of the best drinks there is right oh yeah but you can mess it up I mean it there's not a lot of ingredients with the way you make it up make it or the things that you use the mitigate can mess up I've seen bartenders make this drink unless time then it takes them to pour pint of beer because it's simple right shot of whiskey coffee some sugar and then cream usually they just dude I could ready wit kind yeah and that's where they're gonna mess it up you want to be able to drink the cream with the coffee yeah um if it's the redi whip stuff and you're like almost eating it yeah you got to eat your way to oh that's not good isn't he enough with like wooden beam up your mother but there's nothing better than tasting the cold rich cream immediately before that hot sweet boozie boozie coffee yeah that jointed that's I can't fit all right I love allegedly get how this all came about yeah so apparently there was this guy Joe Sheridan and it was in western ireland where these Americans were stranded or they just couldn't they were trying to get back and in the airport it was on the 1940s it was a cold wintry day and he's trying to warm everybody up so he served them coffee with Irish whiskey no and they all started asking all were you serving those Brazilian coffee he says Oh Irish bog yes brilliant right yeah I don't think that's right I think that's true it's not legendary you said legendary but that sounds very reasonable to pay pods it does all right so let's get started you need hot coffee that's right right some Irish whiskey we're using tricon all today but you can use any Irish whiskey Jameson probably the most common and cream and some sure we like using the sugar in the raw because if you don't need to stir for ever to get the sugar dissolved all right you can use a sugar cube or sugar cube and a half to your taste right right ok let's begin I think I'm gonna start with one and a half ounces of whiskey we're going to pour this right into our Irish coffee glass you want to serve this in a clear glass sometimes we use a small wine glass like this riedl venom pork glass but today we're going to use the Irish coffee glass because there's it's very beautiful see on this dark coffee on the bottom topped with the rich cream half ounce of liquid sugar in the raw this is like a rich simple syrup we find it one of our grocery stores has it nearly coffee another one has an ear of sugar so don't worry what you'll find it yours but this is nice rich and it makes life a lot easier move night you still need to stir it a little bit you got only a smidgen to compare it to right if you put a sugar cube in there sugar keep we're going to have to stir for like 15 seconds it's still it's not going to dissolve no score right in here I always wanted measured perfectly but yeah well we sort of know you want four ounces of coffee then and that brings it up almost to a half inch from the top of our glass here right and while you give that a quick stir I'm going to make our cream get our cruise for crying out loud now if we're making just a glass or two we're going to use our little arrow lot type thing right mm-hmm that's just little bed rio preto risk simple right if you haven't making a bunch of these for a party or something it's or you don't have one of these you can shake the cream and a cocktail shaker all right half a cup of heavy cream in your Boston shaker with one of these little springy things you need to shake it for a minute yeah it's something like you would find in you know if you do protein shakes or whatever like after the gym just that kind of like all whisk thing right or sometimes we use our Nespresso guy here which you pour half a cup of cream in there hit the button in a minute later it's all done for you it's like simple z yeah all right but we're going to use our little arrow latte today and me a fresh bigger if you would well there you go so you want to just incorporate some air into this you wanted to use this for about 15 seconds or until the volume is doubled by about half all right you want to have it a little bit toward the top so here and get in so I'll always see the tip of the whisk right tells you that air is getting in there you could go overboard it's going to get thick pretty quick and going to begin to end up with that stiff cream which you can't drink right and you want it drinkable right not eatable drinkable yes right there you go pour that right on the top of our coffee let it float there beautiful we're going to top it off with a little grated nutmeg you can grate some cinnamon on here if you'd rather watch the fingernails yeah now you have your rich and delicious wonderful Irish coffee enjoy Cheers you ",

Patrick's Day weekend so I decided to buy might make irish coffee and guess what we're going to make a non-dairy version so you know that's like all my thing I got on my little green I've had a pieces together for y'all I got my little shot glass it should be fun okay so what I'm going to do first is start with the coconut cream and I make that real quick then make a copy and add all the ingredients so see you're in fact the first thing that you're going to need is coconut cream you're going to denilla have shot this week we are coconut cream you're going to need powdered sugar so I gotta meet up with last but not least they're going to kill bowl that's why I couldn't breathe in cubicle okay but I'm not going to do this exactly to measure and we're going to make a small amount for myself and for the students the coconut came for the cost actually forgot my room it actually bought a hand blender so I'm going to try this out to see how it goes okay listen mr. Hamblin this is this definitely not giving me the desired effect okay y'all something crazy just happened so normally i will clean our pledge message array of the coconut cream right and then i will blend it but that didn't happen it got really like Sophie and I didn't know with you so I put it in the microwave a little bit and mix it together and it got softer so new plan here's a quick cream hopefully it works at this time I'm going to add half a teaspoon of vanilla so I'm going to add a little bit of sugar got maybe two tablespoons problem I like my kind of free stuff I'm gonna add see it's definitely looking more like with pain now I don't know what was going on earlier y'all ok so now I'm going to prep the coffee and then oxidized misery together ok so now the coffee is dead you got value then we're going to add the daemon which is only takes one shot there's it up a little so good it smells really good okay so i put the coconut cream in a little bag and I'm going to squeeze it on top of the coffee and then you have the Irish coffee dairy free let's see how it tastes it's pretty nice actually I like that it's like it's not to sleep because I didn't add me figure i'll add up with sugar into actual coconut cream and then the Bailey's here I can have a little bit of sugar in it and so that's a mess it's not going to eat when you get a nice flavoring of the whiskey and it comes together really nicely so there you go I urge copy non-dairy style so thank you so much for watching everyone don't forget to like subscribe comment and stare and have a wonderful fantastic day and be safe see you next time bye ",

Patrick's Day everyone hmm that's good one little post note if you don't really want to go through all the trouble of whipping up the cream to make the little crown you can make it with either just pouring cream right in or with milk but if you do that you won't get the crown on the top it'll mix in make it very more cappuccino colored it's still good though trust me I've tried it it's still good that way it's just not doesn't look as cool shall we say just just so you know ",

        "content": "did you hear back answers in another DJ through to mix drink out too well you see a whole mess of ingredients out in front of this little coffee here little cream and sugar saying DJ we make them for us well today we're going to make one of the most classic hot toddy drinks there are out there we're going to make an Irish coffee but we're going to make the DJ brew tube twist on this that's right we're and we're going to make the world wide stout Irish coffee that's right i'll be your cocktail beer toddy I know you haven't seen one of those have you but we're going to prepare this this worldwide sell Irish coffee in the traditional style and we're going to make it like to do at the point of Easter cafe at San Francisco California and they've been making this drink there since nineteen fifty two they were the first to popularize it after was invented in Ireland at an airport that in it ever since then it's just grown and exploded ever since nineteen fifty-three the year after they were pouring more Irish whiskey than any bar in the United States and probably North America so really classic drink and people line up to get this one I've had their version there and it's really delicious I think they use doers Irish whiskey their special plan made just for them but you can correct me if I'm wrong I can't remember the exact frame but it is really tasty I figured I replace it and I make my own twist on it by adding worldwide stout which is a really strong stout in case you don't know it clocks in between eighteen and twenty percent abv so that's between 36 and 40 proof so this is a liqueur strength you know sort of beer and it's good in part I've had this before it's going to impart nice chocolate notes and roasting is and dark fruits and all kinds of lovely flavors into this classic drink so let's get to making it where we got four ingredients we got four ingredients in this of course we got our worldwide stout or whiskey either one we've got coffee we got sugar and we got cream to top it for easy ingredients and as you'll see this is a super easy drink to me so you check out my glass here with little cap on it that's because I've warmed it up with some warm water you want to do that first you want to prepare your glass you want a warm glass for a you know toddy drink and you want a cold glass for like say martinis and things of that sort you know you prepare your glass you get a better drink and a better experience so take our glass here we're going to dump a water all right then first goes in our sugar I've got three teaspoons I like it on the sweeter side I got three teaspoons and I use cane sugar I think it's important to use cane sugar why because it dissolves better in the coffee and you get nothing worse than getting to the bottom of glass and having that you know sugar lump in the bottom beet sugar does that if you find sugar cubes most times those are made a cane sugar to view sugar cubes you between two and three of those so boom put our sugar in next up we got our coffee we're going to fill it up to about here so we leave a little space to the top for our cream copper boom get in here now this is fresh brewed coffee as you can see it's steaming hot you can also use a French press to make this if you do the French press version I recommend getting a big one because if you have somebody around they're going to want one of these two that's why I tend to make a pot of coffee before I do these so we get this stirred up nice if you go to the point of Vista cafe one of the coolest thing is the big show that you see there as well it's really cool to watch will make like 20 of these at a crack so here we've got two ounces of worldwide stout and we've warmed this up to room temperature so we don't get a cold coffee I'm going to blend this real quick with a spoon boom and now we have our whipped cream this is loose whipped cream it doesn't have to be you know like party topping or something you're going to put on top of a cake that's like they call this bartenders whipped cream also or lose either one you want just get light peaks we've got a beat so you got a thickness and we're going to take a spoon and we're going to slowly pour it over the back of the spoon here see it's coming out slow so hopefully we'll get a nice capper and really nice layered effect on this drink pouring it slow and low to the glass is what helps you get that nice cap and also when you have it whip just thin enough that it'll pour like it is now but not too thick that it's nothing to come out of the cup here for you but here we go the whole trick of this and point of this is that you're going to drink the hot coffee through the cold whipped cream but take a look at that guys there you have it looks like a Guinness in the glass if you didn't know better done it gorgeous perfectly layered Irish coffee let's get a taste of this because I'm ready to have something this is my dessert tonight because you know I don't do pie and cake damn that's good wow you got the sweetness from the cream fresh hot coffee sweetened just enough for my taste or to your taste and we've got the world wide stout in there that's bringing chocolate notes of roasted notes and they're like a bit of cherry in the background like dark fruits and raisin ma'am it's totally delicious give this a try if you have a strong stout give it a go if not just replace the stout with your favorite whiskey or bourbon and you got an Irish coffee going on so to the next DJ brew tube we got to do something really important we need to think globally drink locally and support the craft cocktail and beer movement because we're doing both of those right now simultaneously since we've gotta be your tail going on and you know what that will keep variety coming and cool new drinks and new ideas and riffs on classics like this one made popular by the point avista cafe in San Francisco you know what that's how we do it around here so Thanks minutes each and every one of you for watching it is your first time watching plz sub up we got lots more make drinks um videos coming out mixed beer reviews and all kinds of crazy fun so till then I got this like I said thanks a million and I got nothing but a bunch of Irish coffee drinking love for you actually worldwide stout Irish coffee drinking love for you to be correct and you know what ",

        "content": "hey guys thanks for checking out this in India slicker and today I'm making a classic Irish coffee drink now today I'm making the Buena Vista version of it and it is basically the first when they brought it over to America basically the first Irish coffee that was made in America you can check out out buena vista in san francisco they use these awesome glasses that you get from libby i will link where you can actually buy these in the description below so what we're doing here we're making the Irish coffee you need some Irish whiskey you need some heavy whipping cream that you whip into basically a thick mixture not a stiff mixture but thick enough that it will pour yet be kind of phone me almost like a cappuccino foam so we have that and some brown sugar simple syrup it's a two-to-one ratio two parts brown sugar to one part hot water also some strong coffee and I didn't really have a strong strong coffee so I just took regular coffee and doubled it to make it a double power so what we start off with is we take hot water and we put it in our glass to make sure our glass gets nice and hot because we don't want to serve this drink in a cold glass so once it's hot we'll just dump that water out and get ready to make this cocktail so we start by taking one and a half ounces of our Jameson or Irish whiskey of your choice and we're going to pour that in and after we do that we'll take about 1 teaspoon or it's about a half an ounce of the simple syrup if you just want to actually throw a teaspoon of the straight brown sugar in there you can do that as well and then we're going to take our hot coffee give me about three ounces almost over hot coffee and you want to leave a little bit of room at the top so when we put our iron or whipped cream in there I'm sorry it will float on top so stir that up kind of nice and we're going to do is take our whipped cream that we whisked together and we can pour that down the back of a bar spoon and if it works out the way it's supposed to it should float right on top nicely and give us this really nice collar as you can see it worked and this is how you make a buena vista Irish coffee it's a really solid drink and the reason we layer it with the whipping cream is so we're drinking that coffee through that layer of cold refreshing cream and you're supposed to do this rather than use whipped cream from a can that is not the right way to do it if you see somebody doing it that way let them know they're wrong so that's a make the Irish coffee the Buena Vista way it is a delicious drink it really is it will warm you up an ink on a cold day it's also a great Saint Patrick's Day drink as well let me tell you this drink is pretty strong considering its two parts coffee one part whiskey if you want to add a little bit more sugar in there or maybe cut down on the whiskey if you're not into such a strong drink you can do that as well but I like them this way I've been making these all week long and then turn it out really good so thanks for watching this an idiot slicker this is how you make an Irish coffee hopefully I did the drink justice if you like doing it a different way or you think I screwed it up feel free to let me know YouTube is pretty honest when it comes to that kind of stuff so let me know what you thought of it give me subscribe if you like because I make these drinks these types of drinks all the time so if you like it subscribe and remember guys it's okay to drink like an idiot ",

Run hot water slowly over the glass or mug\nuntil it\u2019s at room temperature, or warmer, and dry it. Pouring hot coffee into a cold glass could\ncause the glass to crack. Step 2. Add brown sugar. Step 3. Pour in the whiskey and hot coffee, leaving\na bit of room at the top for whipped cream. For a cold version of this, chill sweetened\ncoffee before adding the whiskey, or freeze some in an ice cube tray. Step 4. Stir well, until the sugar to dissolves completely. Step 5. Squirt or spoon a dollop of whipped cream\nso it simply sets on top of the drink. Step 6. Do not stir\u2014not only does the hot drink\ntaste better sipped through the cream, it stays warmer longer with the cream on top.

Patty's Day so we'll chill in the air so it's nice to have a nice little warm warm coffee and Irish whiskey when your joint parades the first one I'm going to show you is what we do serve here at those little bright in it's a it's basically a caramelized rim on the edge of on the edge of the class so i'm going to show you how to do that as far as Irish coffees go you really can't go wrong with an Irish whiskey it's you know some people prefer scotch to Irish whiskey but Irish whiskeys got the sweet finish that really takes great coffee Jameson is a bit of the industry standard and available everywhere it's in every bar in America here we use Patty's which is new they just started important about 10 years ago and we think it's a great product here my personal favorite will be told amar do Bushmills bush Moses is kind of well known it's got a little bit sweeter finish to it so a lot of people actually prefer it in their Irish coffees tonight we're just going to show you our recipe so the first thing we do is we start a bain marie bain marie is just a dull boy put some hot water and use the hot water to warm our brand the reason we're going to warm that is because a warm alcohol is how you hold the flame so while that warms up there I'm going to rim our coffee mug with a little bit of just granulated sugar as you put that there doesn't take long to warm this up at all and again you put about a half ounce of brandy right in the bottom of the mug sometimes the grill flame is good for this but if you just touch the alcohol you'll see as it's warm it holds the flame and then as you swirl that around the edge of the glass that will caramelize the sugar on the edge of the glass and of course you want to just want to be very careful when dealing with flames and liquid because if it runs away and gets on your skin it is brutal so we'll let that flame out we take a one ounce pour patties Irish whiskey and top it with hot fresh coffee regular decaf whatever you prefer now when I make my Irish whiskey's at home I like to use a fresh whipped cream the effort of time saver will whip cream on the top right all right some people garnish that with a little cr\u00e8me de menthe give it a little green color I personally don't like mint eNOS in my Irish coffee so that's our old brine in fermoy sugar Irish coffee so the next version i'm going to show you is a recipe that was taught to me by an old restaurant to our family friend named art tiffany apparently this recipe originated the Drake Hotel to world-famous hotel in in Chicago and what they do there is they take about a tablespoon of brown sugar and then again just a warm liquid again you can use a warm to the core if you like but even just hot water and it's just enough to make a slurry and what that does is that just adds a little extra sweetness to the whiskey one ounce again we're using Patti's Irish whiskey hot coffee and again whipped cream like I said before I prefer to use a fresh whipped cream if you're interested making that home it's very simple about a cup of heavy whipping cream a little bit of powdered sugar and just a touch of vanilla extract whip that you can hand whip it if you like but a machine works much better and again this is a traditional Irish coffee the recipe comes from the Drake Hotel in Chicago very simple drinks great for parades especially on cold days ",

        "content": "hello in Traverse happy st. Patrick's Day as you can see I'm celebrating I'm wearing green and in order to make this day a lot more special I will teach you how to make an amazing Irish coffee now I have been to a lot of places and I have ordered these drinks this drink in a lot of places but nobody does it right I will teach you how to make the best Irish coffee so you're in for a treat now the Irish Coffee is not that it is very difficult to make in fact it is quite easy the difficult thing about Irish Coffee is that you need a lot of ingredients to make it taste good if you have all these ingredients which are not very easy to find you will have a great Irish coffee so if you're ready let's begin as you can see we have everything we need right here first of all you need an espresso machine if you do not have an espresso machine you cannot continue now you will also need with cream to be quite honest I prefer the United promising them the one that's not spray you will also need coffee good coffee and I mean the espresso coffee I usually trust starbucks just be sure that it says bold in the tag it is even better if you grind the coffee at the moment that you're preparing this drink if if it's a price grind it will taste a lot better and finally you will also need sure now you pretty much obviously have sugar at home so no problem on that you also need whiskey now try to get the Irish whiskey I prefer James Stone i think is the best one don't use scotch whiskey it is will taste a little different so the best whiskey to do this drink is Irish whiskey you will also need a lighter or matches okay the first step for making this drink is to make the espresso shot so the first thing that we're going to do is grind the coffee beans if you don't already have some rest so coffee beans grinded go and bridle be sure to grind them to an espresso grind which is a fine right but not true fine if you make it purifying you will only clog your espresso machine so it has to be fine fine grind but don't make it like powder little lesson powder this excellent now that you have your private coffee we will make first the expressive shots for a regular sized Irish coffee I recommend doing just one thick espresso shot if you go with few shots of espresso it will be too too bitter and Irish coffees supposed to be sweet not bitter okay we will make first the will make espresso shot first and I'll explain why in just seconds now we have our espresso shot you can know if it's a good espresso shot because good espresso always has this this stands layer of that's called coffee cream it's a it's a little bit of foam and you know it's a good good shot when you get that we have our espresso and we're going to keep it right here for a little while before we do that you need to put some sugar in it actually too 2 teaspoons will actually do the trick one tail and shake we're going to set the coffee aside for a little bit and we're going to continue with the rest for things okay here's a good part now we are going to do the Irish artist grab your whiskey and you're going to pour that you are going to pour a bit of the whiskey into whichever plays are going to be serving your copy I prefer this kind of lungs try not to use a regular coffee mug because they are too big and you'll end up with a very big Irish coffee so use either this one or for your glass of wine that also does a trick okay so we're going to pour a little bit into here not too much hey what smells great really great okay remember it has to be Irish coffee in order to taste better okay now here comes a tricky part and here is a part where you're going to need practice okay what we're going to do with our espresso machine and see if I can get it all right is that we are going to use as little came up right here in order to make steam okay we will use it makes team and to heat the whiskey now you're probably wondering why we made the coffee first because we're going to use the steam and when you turn on the scheme of the of your espresso machine more often than not it will burn the coffee if you make the coffee afterwards so it is important that first you do Bo you do the coffee and you have it safely placed over here you're making three Irish coffees many comfy for three Irish coffees so we're going to heat the gilak to cut the whiskey for about 15 seconds with the steam okay so it's very hot now the whiskey is very hot so what you do is that you use your matches or your lighter and get it close and let it up as you can see if it is now the whiskey is on fire okay I don't know the camera can see that there's a flame coming out of the bog right now okay so what you're going to do now now this is a tricky part this is what makes Irish coffee and art okay you're going to start moving the Irish coffee you move it in order for oxygen to get in the Theia into the whiskey to keep the fire going now if you start moving the whiskey the firewall just extinguish so you have to keep moving in a circular motion and the flame will keep going now if you wonder I wish country to be really strong and you have lots of alcohol in it and to be you know very very strong you're going to stop doing this very soon now if this kind of cuff you want to be subtle if you don't want it to be so so strong you will keep on doing this until most of the alcohol as evaporated okay with use of the flame okay you have to be very careful because usually the mud gets extremely extremely high so that's good enough to let it sit for a little while and the plane extinguishes by itself now what we're going to do is to add the comfy that we that we pit heard early okay earlier I always leave little space wherever it is you're preparing that's a little space for the whipped cream grab little of your whipped cream generous portion okay and you're going to add more sugar to it you can also substitute sugar with a with a evil or through the low or whatever okay okay so you're going to drop in again two teaspoons I'm sure we are going to use the steam from the machine okay so you're going to put this glass right here and you're going to drop some scheming to make the cream a little hot and to make it a little less thick okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to start shaking it okay keeping whipping it until we have a fairly consistency like this keep on waiting until you get something like this okay which looks a lot of looks kind of liquid and finally what you're going to do is that you have your copy here so what you're going to do is that you will pour the cream on top of the copy but you're going to have to do this very slowly okay just try not to mix the cream with the rest of the coffee okay you can garnish with a little bow with a cherry or something like that I usually don't like to do that you're all set you're done okay so now we are done with our Irish coffee what we have to do is try it and see how we did very sweet extremely good all right happy st. Patrick's Day enjoy ",

Patrick's Day but also anytime it's cold outside this drink is sure to warm you up here's what you'll need 2 ounces of Irish whiskey we like the good stuff so we're going to be using Jameson 2 tablespoons of brown sugar a double shot of espresso and some fresh-made whipped cream and for that you're going to need 1/2 cup of heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of confectionery sugar when you make whipped cream it helps to have everything cold so I've had my bowl and freezer for a little while and I just took my heavy cream out of the fridge so I'm going to add 1/2 a cup of cream to my bowl and start whipping now I'm going to wait until soft peaks start to form before I add my confectionery sugar and vanilla extract and it's going to take a few minutes to get to that point oK we've sped things up a bit but I'm starting to get those soft peaks so now is the time to add the vanilla and sugar now I'm going to continue whipping until I get some stiff peaks you just want to be careful not to go too far around so it's going to get clumpy all right that looks good now I'm going to put this back in the fridge to keep it cold while we make the rest of our drink all right so I'm going to be using an Irish coffee mug to put my drink together and I'll first add the two tablespoons of brown sugar and the two ounces of Irish whiskey all right now what I'm going to do is actually use the steam wand on my Prophet Tech Pro 500 to heat and mix the brown sugar and whiskey all right so first you always have to purge your steam wand okay okay that's nice and warm now remember you always want to wipe down and purge your steam wand after steaming all right now let's get that espresso going for our espresso I'm using neuromas or fiha it's one of our favorites it's a consistent chroma producer and has a nice chocolatey finish that will complement the rich combination of the whiskey and brown sugar and it's in a contrast nicely with that real whipped cream look at all that crema I mean the or fiea is just delicious it's never better and on its own it's one of our favorite espresso blends and definitely worth a try alright I've got my cream nice and cold from the fridge now let's finish putting it together so just add your double shot of espresso to your glass then give it a little stir okay now we top it with the whipped cream alright put a couple pretty large dollops of this delicious whipped cream on top all right boy doesn't that look good mmm you know the hot stuff coming through that fresh cold whipped train all the flavors it's so delicious this is an Irish coffee and I'm Morgan from whole latte love thanks for watching your number one source for everything coffee whole latte love calm ",

This is why we brought a third person to help in this episode. -Today's subject is coffee. -But I do not drink coffee. But I do not drink coffee. -Alexandros does, however. -I'll let him take my place. -Bye. -YOLO. Alexandros is the head of Bar Academy's coffee seminars. -Alexandros Foukis. -Hello, guys. How are you? -Would you like an Irish coffee? -Let's go. A scale. A Chemex coffeemaker. We'll use a paper filter to make the coffee. Roasted coffee beans for filter coffee. For our recipe, we need 18 gr of coffee. And we will add 250 ml of water. Our coffee is ready. We need a typical Irish coffee glass. We also need 20 ml of sugar syrup. We will use 30 ml of Irish whiskey. We fill up with coffee. And we stir well. Let's go to the heavy cream. We need heavy cream and a shaker. We shake it up and we top up with the heavy cream foam. And this is Irish coffee. Thank you for the effort, Alexandros. You were great! Let's make a twist of Irish coffee. Our turn. A Capita nosing glass. Amarena syrup by Fabbri. -Spice syrup. -50 ml of Bulleit rye whiskey. And the secret ingredient. Filter coffee made by Chemex method. -We stir our product. -Alexandros' heavy cream. With a little Baileys. -May I add it? -We shake again. Let me do it. Thank you. And we slowly add the cream over our product. -Voila. -Our twist is ready. Our twist is ready. Where is the other Irish coffee? It's dead. We should take the Irish coffee to the customer quickly, because the previous Irish coffee died after five minutes. -And this is dying slowly. -Yes. Do you have any questions? Do you want to tell us what to do next? -Write below. -And do not forget, subscribe on YouTube. -Thank you very much. Bye. -Bye. ",

        "content": "welcome to the art of the drink video podcast my name is Anthony capparelli and we were talking this week with David Chapman welcome David welcome Thank You Anthony David is the owner of bean traders coffee here in Durham North Carolina and I wanted to bring him in so that we could learn a little bit about the history of coffee that sounds great so let's start with tell me a little bit about bean traders how you got into the culture business a little bit about the stores okay well I've worked in coffee since I was about 17 really and so for me it's something I've always loved and it was just a natural progression to ownership so how many locations you have now we have three stores and two in Durham one in chapel hill well thanks for talking to us that are welcoming okay so let's start with let's let's go coffee 101 take you through coffee i am not a coffee drinker all right historically probably the only person I know who doesn't drink a lot of coffee and I actually came into being traitors one day to learn about coffee and your briefs it was wonderful took me through picking out a roast and the whole bit and I had my very first cup here so let's go over some of that are some photos I know a lot of people drink coffee on a daily basis may not know a lot about right well to start really elementally coffee is the seed of a plant and historically it was discovered in ethiopia by a goat herder that watched his flock eat the berries the first coffee shop opened in 1650 in england and it fast became the world's most popular drink so let's say like me you're you don't know that much about coffee and you want to move off of instant or maybe the coffee pot in the authoress move up something a little bit better than that from a little bit i how you go about um well really what sets us apart bean traders is that we fresh rose all of our coffee here so what we're a part of is the third wave of coffee and this is a movement in America that kind of started in the 90s where rather than just that diner cup of coffee that people are used to having it's really about selecting really high quality beans from all over the world and each beam each each country that produces coffee the beans have unique flavor characteristics to that being so it's reminiscent of wine there's a lot of parallels there and I would recommend probably like a medium roasted Columbian coffee or a guatemalan coffee to someone who is just stepping in this specialty coffee because it's nice and mild so now you mentioned that there were some similarities to win dis coffee actually pick up characteristics of say the soil that it's grown in the climate yeah definitely soil conditions and anything that would maybe pollinate in the air there's a Theo being coffee from a region of Ethiopia called her are and the coffee actually tastes of blueberry naturally because of other crops that are grown so now tell me a little bit about the roasting because I always here you know French Roast and dark shirt and light roast why do you roast the beam um well coffee beans are almost like popcorn kernels in that there's a layer of skin pops off when you cook it another facet of the third wave of coffee is fresh roast and coffee roasting mini batches 10 to 25 pounds at a time versus a larger like a coffee that you would buy in your grocery store that maybe 300 pounds were roasted three months ago alright so we're here with Madonna hello hi and you are a manager here peen traders I am correct so what are you going to take us through um this is called a press pot or a French press is most commonly known one of the most recommended ways of brewing coffee to enjoy every flavor from the beam that you grind okay great basically what you want to do is grind your coffee bean as close to brewing time as possible a coarse grind so that when you are filtering the coffee through the press pot you're actually absorbing the most flavor from the water and when you plunge down that you're not getting any grinds up through that screen filter ah seems important so in essence you're going to measure out one level teaspoon of coffee ground coffee for every cup of water okay so this is about an eighth cup press pot so we've got eight level teaspoons of ground coffee in there your next step is to get boiling water into your coffee pot here here at the shop we do use our espresso machine which already has the steamed water which is boiling okay you're boiling water is what brings out the most flavor from your being oh look at that wow you actually can see ahead forming on it already just almost like a beer that's unbelievable and your hot water is the trick most home brewers and a regular brewing a home brewer coffee pot your mr. coffee so on so forth the problem with those most people complain that they cannot get as good of its flavor out of their copy at home as they do here at our shop two key elements are filtered water and the temperature of the water filtered water and the temperature below and you're going to take it up to the base of your room in here for a good level pot of coffee okay and then the key to a good press pot is stirring those coffee grinds around in there for at least 30 seconds you're actually stirring for boots okay so what you're doing is you're getting that coffee in the water in a nice marriage in there getting that flavor out smell the coffee oh yeah that's amazing so in essence you want to let this brew for three to five minutes just like that just like that after you start it for a good 30 seconds depending on how strong you like your coffee now if we didn't have let's say Oh an espresso machine at home we could have just boiled the water and just right all boil put it in mm-hmm great all right well let's check back on this in about three minutes awesome so I guess it's been about four minutes exactly all right so we're ready to press cool so what you want to do now is plunge down slowly so you can place your hand there and just gently and slowly plunge your press pot down oh wow look at that so what it's doing is it's trapping the grounds mm-hmm and then just pushing them right through exactly you've got a screen down there so it acts as a filter when you pour so your grinds are not coming through right so all right there's our pot that's it that's it all we have to do is pour and enjoy now why don't we do this why don't you pour me a cup of coffee and i'm going to turn it into an Irish coffee what do you think that sounds wonderful all right each week our art of the drink video podcast prize package will consist of a makers mark apron a copy of my art of the drink volume 1 bar essentials DVD and a limited edition version of that special touch a makers mark cookbook not available in stores so I'm going to turn this into an Irish coffee in honor of st. Patrick's Day and there's a fq Irish coffee very simple there's only three things that I do for all my Irish coffees one always making it a clear glass so you can see it and I like actually use a hurricane glass they get the form looks real good and you get a lot of coffee alright so I'm going to start with an ounce and a quarter just a shot of good Irish whiskey nice my favorite and second thing that I always do use absolutely the best coffee possible and I think we're set I think that count so this is our press pot is all right correct looks good oh yeah look at that ah that is fantastic wonder I'm going to take it right up to the neck so that I leave room for my whipped cream hmm you guys use good whipped cream here only the best absolutely see if i can get this right there you go wow look at that that looks beautiful and the third thing that I always do with my Irish coffee is I like to top it off with just a little bit of cr\u00e8me de menthe for color green creme de menthe not the white stuff and floors and just drizzle just a little bit over the whipped cream Wow and that is our st. Patrick's Day Irish coffee he thank you so much you're welcome thank you happy st.

        "content": "Welcome youtubers, friends, brothers, sisters, lovers, malt maniacs, beer brothers and sisters, Irish whiskey enthusiasts. Tonight we are going to make an Irish Coffee. I made one already, so I have the process\ndown. So I wanted to share it. I bought a Tullamore D.E.W. Irish Whisky,\nI got my cup, I got some heavy cream, Frischer Schlagrahm [German name], an Irish coffee\nmug, some brown sugar, we'll use a teaspoon of that, and I've got the coffee over there,\nin the coffee maker. So, without further adieu let's go do heavy\ncream first, we'll refrigerate it, while that\u2019s being refrigerated we'll prep the cup with\nhot water, after adding hot water to the cup we'll put the sugar in whiskey in, stir it\nand dissolve the sugar. Brew the coffee. Bring the cream back out of the refrigerator\nand pour it on top and we'll have an Irish coffee. So let\u2019s begin. First step: Puts some cream in the cup. We\nare going to whisk this. To have it nice and thick to go over the hot coffee. Ah, kay, so. [whisking] Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta\ndo. [whisking] As you can see its getting thicker. [whisking] That should do it. We'll whip it up again a little later, now\nwe'll put this in the fridge. So it keeps it nice and cold while we're doing\nthe rest of the preparations. Alright, so, ah, we want to put some hot water\nin the cup first. [water pouring] Prime the cup! So that way your, we're going to pour\ncold cream in here we're going to put room temperature whiskey in here. So, by doing\nthat we're going to be cooling down the cup. So we want to have a cup that is already hot.\nSo that way when we get to the final drink the Irish coffee is pretty nice and hot like\nit should be. Okay, so. We've heated up the cup, nice and warm. So, next, we want to put in about a teaspoon\nof brown sugar. Now this can be to your taste, of course. Let\u2019s see. I\u2019m going to put in about that\nmuch. And then I'm going to put in about a 3/4 shot\nof Tullamore D.E.W Irish Whiskey. Stir this up nicely. [spoon stirring and clanking on glass] Of course, once you put hot coffee in it,\nit will help to dissolve the sugar. Now I wonder if this thing will fit under\nmy coffee maker. So, I'm going to go ahead and pause the video,\nand\u2026 Alright, hopefully this isn't going to make\ntoo much coffee. Sooo, yeah, we'll see. Do the classic coffee, cut the vid have to\npour some out. Either that or the long espresso. Hmmmm. Hmmmm. Nope, okay, try the coffee. [coffee grinding] See if this works or not. Glass is still warm, its not hot anymore. Well, just in case I have to swap out cups. [coffee pouring] Add some coffee to the Irish. [spoon stirring] Looks like it might be okay. Still plenty\nof room for cream. Yep now we are getting too full. Alright, well maybe we would have been okay. So, pause and be back with the cream. Actually, we can do it right there. Well, I'm going to - Alright so I wnat to\nshow you if I can here. Here's how it looks coming out of the frigerator.\nI'm going to go ahead and whip it one more time so its pretty thick. Aw, heck with it, yeah I'm gonna whip it one\nmore time. Nope, yep, nope, yep, indecisiveness So, keep it cool on top, put the cream on\ntop, pour it over the spoon, in theory. Oh my! It poured over a little bit. Hehehe, alrighty. Alight, so, we've made our Irish coffee. You can see here, looks like did a little\nbit of a mixup, maybe too much cream. Should be all coffee here and shouldn\u2019t\nbe this much cream. So, maybe what I need to do is whip it more\nor maybe not as much cream next time. Ahhh! Outstanding! The cream is cold on top, the coffee is nice\nand hot and its just got that warmth from good old Irish coffee-whiskey. Cheers! Have a nice day! ",

Patrick's Day into all my Irish brother and I say happy st. Patrick's Day today as you may notice I have a helper this is jacob nekocon Jacob the Leprechaun is here helping me out today as we talk about no other than I copy Irish coffee that's right so we actually have two Irish coffee recipes we're going to go over one the traditional and one of what's become an Irish coffee recipe mainly out of convenience so get on that first what you need is you need a nice glass nice Irish coffee glass beer nice handle that does the trick if you don't have one of these can I speak beer mug or something as long as it's glass if you can see it's got a handle you can all and it's big because it got to put some stuff in there then what we need is one and a half ounces of Irish whiskey we're using Jameson's Irish whiskey we need one teaspoon of brown sugar which is already in the cup waiting to be poured on by the six ounces of hot coffee I am a nice french roast in here bold cuz I like it bold then we're going to put top that off with a little bit of whipped cream whipping cream now whipped cream its whipping cream it's different there is a difference so you want to make sure you're not getting whipped cream out of the can and spraying it on but you actually want to get some nice whip whipping got me confused some nice whipping cream which my wife was nice enough to whip up for us earlier so we will be putting that on top so take our glass you don't have to put the brown sugar in I like to because when it pours on top the six ounces of hot coffee there this is a hot coffee drink you see it just dissolves and disintegrates right into the coffee when I do put sugar in my coffee in those rare occasions but I tend to like it drink it as is or black in coffee parlance I do the same thing it's going to put the sugar in the bottom end the milk pour it in your mixes itself it's great so that we have you can see ya brown sugar is pretty much dissolved can always do that like then we're going to take jameson whiskey now we want to make sure we give that one a nice stir Jake if I don't think we had a big enough glass what do you think this may not even have been think maybe I should taste some now should I whoo let's dub all right now for the final topping and that one makes it nice piracy okay let's see Patrick's big is some whipped no not with weeping whipping cream Jacobs do the honors oh come on we need more than that we're gonna big scoop we want this thing to look delightful and delectable come on keep going oops that's right I'll get it maybe we should got a bigger spoon there we go look at that my friends whoops swoon all over the place here that's my friend there's a nice Irish coffee so well they taste this oh the way the the coffee with the whiskey and brown sugar just comes right through the whipped cream oh that is collectible that is nice job my friend so this is an a traditional Irish whiskey with the clean this up if you want to take the easy way out when I see these way out is no one has become known as Irish cockney that we go know some restaurants and they fill up on the table the menu rather as Irish coffee it's not this that you just saw me about me but rather it will be six ounces or a cup of coffee with baileys irish cream mixed in that's okay it's great it's actually really good and it's something that my wife prefers over this we save this for her so she will actually have put some coffee and should put some Bailey's in there sometimes we put some whipped cream on top sometimes she won't but the the Bailey's is rich enough enough for her but if she wants to make it that dessert like or anybody does then you can put the whip whipping cream on the top you used the baby's coming the brown sugar and you definitely don't want the whiskey in there because it's just a different type of taste so there you have it Irish coffee you can do the traditional with Irish whiskey coffee brown sugar and wait Oh whipping cream or you can say the easy way out and put coffee with just a little bit of Bailey's either way enjoy it it's a great Saint Patrick's Day treat that is it that is all for this episode of in the kitchen want to just come to see wish our Irish friends a happy st. Patrick's Day so uh this is part of the show where we throw the beans you're going to throw so until next time erin go bra ",

        "content": "well the forecast for the st. Patty's Day is looking pretty cold go figure every day is like that right now but the weekend looks good so instead of cold beer why not warm up with an Irish coffee on Monday we asked Jack teach to join us he's a bartender at hi-hat lounge on Brady but he's also a top finalists in a national bartending competition and that landed him in the pages of Esquire magazine congratulations thank you so much oh yeah I mean it was really exciting competition you know and to work so hard at the local level and they'd be chosen to even go and compete unfortunately I didn't take the whole thing but you know I'm up against the other five finalists of it from all over the country yeah would you make did you make just one drink just one drink it is all about Manhattan so we all made a different variation of a Manhattan mind focused on autumn flavors and a lot of orchard apple I made some homemade ingredients with apples and walnuts and for you Blair was it about the drink you know I would like to say it's a little more about the drink but there's you know it's there's showmanship to any competition so you know I'm not much to light things on fire I get that what do you love about Irish coffee and actually before you answer that I want to just ask you do a lot of people make it wrong you know it's like with any drink if it's the way you like it then it's not wrong okay but if you want to get really strict some people are very strict about the proportions and about the ingredients and what I love about an original irish coffee is that it's very simple it really only has four ingredients they said you need cream as rich as an Irish brogue and you need coffee as strong as a friendly hand you need sugar as sweet as the tongue of a rogue and whiskey as sharp as the wit of the land I like that it's truly only four ingredients and so you shall say that though I'm terrible Lucky Charms at all I'm sure you know it just takes a little bit of brown sugar to start things off and you always want to pre-heat your couple if you're going to be doing a coffee drink cuz otherwise it's cold before you take the first great point so then you just add a little bit of your whiskey i'm using the redbreast it's a 12 year aged irish whiskey it's a little step up you know when you're using so few ingredients I find that it's best to use something a little more interesting okay no but you can pick up Jameson or even powers and nipote castle here pretty readily available at most liquor stores in stir that up just slow at the bottom there's it's just a little bit of brown sugar okay some people like to use the demerara raw sugar i find the brown sugar itself with that little bit of molasses adds another little level yeah there's only a few ingredients so why not make it more interesting yeah by using the best ingredients that you can speaking of the best ingredients you're using steep and brew coffee the copy of the morning blend so we appreciate you do you know what blend that was probably the morning blend blend I would hope so I was lucky enough by TV magic that they had the coffee waiting when I got here so awesome do you prefer the coffee to be stronger or lighter with an Irish coffee well like anything it's how you prefer to take your coffee in the first place but when you're adding other ingredients I find a richer flavor in the coffee will help it stand out and keep it present in the cocktail now as far as the cream goes you don't want to take a fully whipped cream it's supposed to still be pourable but it's supposed to stay at the top that's actually one of the trickier parts when they brought it to America to figure out how they were doing that you know in Ireland they have much less stringent rules about getting fresh farm creams and now we're starting to be able to get those things available not as pasteurized so I took a local cream and I actually infused it a little bit with roasted cocoa nibs and vanilla because you know why not add a little bit more like I always say and if you're wondering instead of pulling out a bowl in a whisker your blender your hand mixer just take your little strainer that you probably barely ever use anyway take the spring off and throw it right in your cocktail shaker no way yep we have the cream in there you bring a little spiral thingy in there and you just give it a little shake bartenders do that no it looks so fancy it's not like how I would shake it you just need you have to show off my god well I mean it's deeper than the gym membership so if you do it that way though gives you the opportunity to make it a little less um firm whip so you see it's it's still horrible hey when you put it in your cup you want to use a spoon to help you so that it layers right on the top look at that you're awesome oh that is fancy according to the rules of Irish coffee you're not supposed to stir the cream why not is that how you do it too right you're on sound in okay mm-hmm and then you drink it because you want to have a milk mustache right absolutely well if you're gonna have green all in your hair you may as well have their little milk is fantastic so how do you make it your own if you're making it at home well you know let's say you're not a coffee drinker you can absolutely make this with a nice come something like an Irish Breakfast to you make a double strength so that the tea comes through but it's a really nice way to do it a chai tea would be great in this you know if you're not too keen on the coffee you can make it iced absolutely great iced if we ever have a nice warm day that's a nice way to do it it's also if you like other flavors add a little maple syrup if you don't like brown sugar you know try something like that you infused it with pure vanilla and roasted cocoa nibs how do you infuse things is there any rule of thumb because people always talk about infused vodkas and infused you know it's really much more simple than its own since you just dump it in there and shake it every couple hours for a day or two until it almost marinated it and until it gets to the flavor that you want and I strained it out before I came but you know you could obviously just leave it and their cocoa nibs are fine to eat if you wanted to just leave them and have a little crunchy layer on top oh yeah but you could really infuse it with just about anything cardamom would be really fun if you wanted to do the chai spice flavors you know some people are people get really up in arms if you put Baileys Irish cream into an Irish coffee so this is kind of a way to add some of those flavor profiles if you like it without screwing it up growing up a classic I love it people's can see you do your thing at high hat absolutely okay will be some impact innovations in the near future but will stay open if you pardon our dust will be there for you know we're giving away coffee yeah right as we should right yes call us if you want to win caller number seven wins at four one four seven nine nine 4444 we're going to throw in some coffee up morning in bag and a mug and we also have a bag and a mug for you yeah help us with this I love it great to see you is always check thank you thank you appreciate it we love Jack teach so much from high hat you made us eat delicious irish coffee so we said hey come on over we got more we want to ask you these are delicious yeah Cheers happy st. patrick i dinnae patrick's day awesome I want to know what your favorite tattoo is that you have oh yeah that's like trying to pick which one of my dogs is made that's it well I'm very partial to the stars because they make me a lot of money people come in and say where's that guy with the Stars I do yes well you know it's easier to remember than somebody's name but I gotta say probably my dog Sam what if we can't hold it real still that's a really pretty one too super cool you dog Sam still with you yep yep he's big baby he's 80 pound lap dog you know I got like all Dobermans who thinks that he fits right here no it related to tattoos cuz I have three kids and in seen you you're an adult you love your tattoos totally embrace them I'm always worried that if my kids were to get a tattoo they'll get older and they'll regret it and they're hard to remove how much thought did you put into that before you actually got them well you know I waited until I was probably 26 before i got my first tattoo okay um partially because you don't want to make a silly mistake you know it's not always going to be in fashion and do things that are important to you I say you know I tried to have the talk with my nephew when he decided he was going to run off and get tattoos but you know kids are gonna do what they're gonna do yeah so you know they have to deal with their own action someday kids will be kids yeah yeah cheers really quick what's your favorite cocktail of all time favorite cocktail of all time Oh tough 1 i'm gonna go with aviation cocktail my favorite gin drink great summertime wintertime anytime all right people go too high man i can ask for it absolutely aviation aviation cocktail aviation cocktail okay thank you so much no problem again

A group of travelers arrived in Ireland on\na winter evening in the 1940s and were served coffee with whiskey to warm them up. When\nthe Americans asked what they were drinking, the Irishman told them it was \"Irish Coffee.\"\nUsing a Keurig brewer, we're going to make Original Irish Coffee today with 100% Organic OneCup Breakfast Blend Coffee from Organic Coffee Company. For this recipe, you'll also need 1 tablespoon Brown Sugar, 3 tablespoons Irish Whiskey and some heavy cream to taste. First, insert a 100% Organic OneCup Breakfast Blend Coffee into your Keurig machine. Brew the coffee into a mug. Transfer the coffee to an Irish Coffee Mug until about \u00be full. Add the brown sugar and stir until dissolved. Then, add the Irish Whiskey and stir.\nTop with heavy cream to taste, forming a collar by pouring the cream over the back of a spoon into the glass. While variations of Irish Coffee exist, this\nmethod of preparation comes straight from Dublin. Enjoy on cold days, as originally\nintended, or whenever you crave a special, savory cup of coffee. And the best part of the OneCup Single Serve Coffee from Organic Coffee Company is that it's 97% biodegradable, toss it in the trash with a clear conscience.

Patrick's Day in Gaelic my name is chef Diane stop word and this week what I'm going to do is show you how to cook up the ultimate st. Patty's Day feast and I'm talking real Irish food cooked by yours truly a real Irish girl what we have here is some beef and Guinness that's my dad's recipe some call cannon some Irish soda bread with our lovely Irish cheeses and butter and of course all washed down with the perfect Irish coffee you can have food with that drink in Ireland and of course one of our most famous drinks is the Irish coffee the Irish coffee was actually developed by a barman at Shannon Airport in the West of Ireland and he wanted to create a nice warm drink for some Irish tourists that were coming in on their transatlantic flights so we mix some coffee along with some good Irish whiskey and a little cream and that's how the Irish coffee was born start off making your ish coffee gets a nice strong coffee like I have here what you want to add to it is some brand sugar just put that in and stir it around and make sure it gets dissolved but the sugar is going to do is it's actually going to help you float the cream on top which is kind of the most important part other than the whiskey next of course we've got your Irish whiskey now I'm using some Jamison because I'm from Dublin and at the Dublin whiskey but you know use whatever Irish whiskey you want so I'm just going to pour in our whiskey and don't be mean of course Anna cheek whiskey and Irish is ich gebe aha anishka vahi means water of life so you can see how important whiskey is in to the Irish and then we're going to float the cream on top if you're going to make an Irish coffee I really think you should do it properly don't get out the can of whip cream and just whip it up on top you need to pour it on nice and gently and then you sip the Irish coffee through the cream so just take a spoon like this and hold it with the back of the spoon facing up and just pour on some lightly whipped cream and hopefully if everything goes to plan it's just going to float on top and not sink to the bottom and you will get that Irish coffee almost like a pint of Guinness effect on top slowly pour that in and there you have a traditional Irish coffee Cheers or as we say in Ireland salon shock which means to your help ",

Patrick's Day you might as well we're going to do another drink that I like to do is a black and tan next week we're gonna do is a black and tan I just love jiggy Black and Tans when I was in my early 20s they're fantastic delicious and I recommended in try one the second take so if I don't get this right this time I'm gonna care you don't to drink all these drinks after I hate you oh alright so and start off by taking a bass ale and pour it into a very large flat now like that now I opened up my Guinness i use my snake bite here to pierce the top there so of course nicely okay the last time I did this like five minutes ago it uh it didn't separate as nicely as I would like it probably has something to do with the shape of this glass more than anything else so it's try really hard to make sure that this one separates a little bit nicer whenever you do a layered drink like this or layered whether it's a b-52 or a flag shot or anything like that you really want to make sure that the layers are the state this looks really nice a snakebite as a angry orchard would get us on top a bat is a black and tan or black and blue anything like that she really wanted a nice demarcation of the two different things that you're pouring into the glass will do a b-52 later because I love the hell out of those things shit however this is what it should look like not them that I made it laughs and so there you have it that is your st. Patrick's a pangalactic special and I hope you have a fantastic st. Patrick's Day and I hope you tip your bartenders and I hope that you take a cab or wherever you need to go and in general have a great time because you know what life is short man take it easy guys you have a great night and a good weekend ",

Patrick's Day I thought I'd show you how to make a true Irish coffee if you go to a bar or a restaurant in the United States and order Irish coffee what he usually get is a cup of coffee with a shot of Irish whiskey and whipped cream on top it's not very good and it's not traditional so what you will need to make a real Irish coffee is hot strong coffee Irish whiskey of course you'll need sugar which I prefer the natural sugar and you'll need heavy whipping cream so start with a hot coffee don't fill the cup too tall because you're gonna have to add the whiskey and the whipping cream then put in your sugar give it a good stir while I'm talking socket and dissolve that for you then add your Irish whiskey and for the whipping cream we're not going to whip it we're just going to shake it till it's thickened the beautiful thing about this is if you do too much you could just put it in the fridge as a shaker and use it on your coffee another day so we'll shake that up until it's good in the sick and then what you want to do is take your spoon and lay it right on top of the coffee this will allow you to pour the cream onto the spoon and get that nice layer on top do not stir the coffee this is exactly how you drink it so that as you drink you get a little of the hot coffee with the cold cream and it's absolutely delicious ",

This is why we brought a third person to help in this episode. -Today's subject is coffee. -But I do not drink coffee. But I do not drink coffee. -Alexandros does, however. -I'll let him take my place. -Bye. -YOLO. Alexandros is the head of Bar Academy's coffee seminars. -Alexandros Foukis. -Hello, guys. How are you? -Would you like an Irish coffee? -Let's go. A scale. A Chemex coffeemaker. We'll use a paper filter to make the coffee. Roasted coffee beans for filter coffee. For our recipe, we need 18 gr of coffee. And we will add 250 ml of water. Our coffee is ready. We need a typical Irish coffee glass. We also need 20 ml of sugar syrup. We will use 30 ml of Irish whiskey. We fill up with coffee. And we stir well. Let's go to the heavy cream. We need heavy cream and a shaker. We shake it up and we top up with the heavy cream foam. And this is Irish coffee. Thank you for the effort, Alexandros. You were great! Let's make a twist of Irish coffee. Our turn. A Capita nosing glass. Amarena syrup by Fabbri. -Spice syrup. -50 ml of Bulleit rye whiskey. And the secret ingredient. Filter coffee made by Chemex method. -We stir our product. -Alexandros' heavy cream. With a little Baileys. -May I add it? -We shake again. Let me do it. Thank you. And we slowly add the cream over our product. -Voila. -Our twist is ready. Our twist is ready. Where is the other Irish coffee? It's dead. We should take the Irish coffee to the customer quickly, because the previous Irish coffee died after five minutes. -And this is dying slowly. -Yes. Do you have any questions? Do you want to tell us what to do next? -Write below. -And do not forget, subscribe on YouTube. -Thank you very much. Bye. -Bye. ",
