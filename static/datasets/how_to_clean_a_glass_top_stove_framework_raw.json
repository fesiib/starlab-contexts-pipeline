        "content": "hi guys it's Katie and I did a video last week with my Dollar Tree haul and I showed these scrapers that you can get at the dollar tree therefore for a dollar it's a pretty good deal and I was saying that I use these to clean my glass top stove and I got some questions on how I clean my stove and I'm happy to share some tips with you it's something that I kind of take pretty seriously when we first moved into this house there was a glass top stove in here that was completely trashed and I think the people who lived here before us didn't clean it not even once and we bought this house as a foreclosure and everything was as is but the oven didn't work there was it was missing its oven racks and the stove was just completely crusted over and it had been cooked so many times over and over again that it was almost like cast-iron seasoning and nothing that I could do could clean it so when I got the new stove I've really wanted a glass top stove still but I didn't ever want to go back to how that looks so I've been taking really good care of it because I want it to look it's best for as long as possible so we've had this stove now for about two years and I think that it looks just as brand-new as the day that it was installed so I will show you how I clean it I was gonna make this video earlier in the week but just because I wanted a nice messy stove I was like I was the neatest cook foods like the last few days and we've been grilling out back some so it took me a few days to get a nice dirty stove but I have it now so I'm going to move the camera and show you what it looks like okay so this is what my stove looks like this was salsa that spilled onto this hot burner and the burner was almost cool so it's not too bad this should be able to come off really easily over here this is a coconut milk curry that you know splashed out and this burner was on high so this here even though it's not exactly on the burner it's pretty well cooked on and then I have some spots here in here and then there's like just an overall greasy layer from frying some bacon and from frying the chicken for the curry so the first thing that I do is I just wipe it with regular dish cloth and just soapy water with dishsoap on it just to clean off everything that's going to come off without too much scrubbing so that pretty much cleaned off everything in between the burners it's just what's been cooked on so what landed on hot burners that's gonna be left behind and that's what you really want to get off as soon as possible because the more that you cook it the more it's just gonna get more birth on and sometimes if I splash something on a hunt burner I'll turn it off right away because a lot of times it'll start to smell burnt and and smoke anyway so I'll turn the burner off move the pot to another burner and let it cool down and if it's like right on the burner a lot of times I'll take once the burner has cooled off I'll take a wet rag and just like a soaking wet rag and stick it on that spot and then after we're done eating dinner and I'm cleaning up dishes and wiping down my stove it does help pull some of that off so what doesn't come off from just soapy water I do use this product and I think test commented that she uses this too and normally I am NOT a big proponent of like products that are marketed for certain things like if somebody told me that I had to use this probably wouldn't want to use it but I got it for the previous stove I was just going to try anything to get the previous stove to look better and this bottle has lasted us it's still got quite a bit left in it I've used it pretty much every day for the last two years and then I used it when we first moved in with the other stove too so it does last a long time I got this at a hardware store I don't know if they sell it at like grocery stores or anything like that but generally the part that's messiest is right around the perimeter because the pots here so it splashes out of the pot but then the burner is hot here so this is usually the zone that gets the worst mess now there was not a pot on this stove when I are on this burner when I splashed here but normally I just take this and a little bit goes a long way but I'll just put it there and on any spot where it is and this stuff is the active ingredient is citric acid so it's more than just a clean the citric acid really cuts through grease really well too so even if there's nothing burnt on sometimes I'll just add a tiny little like pea-sized drop and it helps cut the grease over the whole stove especially if I'm frying bacon or something like that so I usually just take this damp rag and I'll kind of smear this rim bright out and I've never left this very long sometimes I leave it for maybe five or ten minutes I'm not sure if there's a problem with leaving it like if you wanted to leave it for an hour or something but usually I just spread it out like that and then I just start scrubbing it and you can feel underneath your washcloth where you hit those spots that are really burnt on so I'm just going to go around I don't know if you can hear that where I hit that spot where it was really burned on so I'm just going to concentrate right there and see what I can get up you can see how much is coming up on the rag so something is coming up so once everything that's going to come up with just the rag comes up you can see how much is coming up on the rags if something is coming up but there is still that big spot here and then those other really burnt on spots so I'm gonna go ahead and use one of these scrapers and when they come they're backwards so this is the back of the razor so it's not sharp here you just pop this and it opens up there turn the razor blade around carefully and then get it lined up like that and then you pop it back down like that okay and my instruction manual for my stove said to use these so it's safe and it's what's recommended if your owner's manual says to use something else then don't listen to me listen to your owner's manual but I'm just gonna scrape at like a 45 degree angle to get those really burnt off areas to come up you can see on the blade how it is coming up and then I just wipe again with my rag and I usually rinse this rag out and wipe this stuff off to rinse off the extra ceramic right so I'll probably since I put quite a bit on I'll probably rinse this round twice so rinse it wipe it down again rinse it and wipe it down again and something about this rim rate says right on the package not to use it on stainless steel appliances you can use it on stainless steel sinks but not stainless steel appliances so I usually wipe this thing down with the round of once it's um rinsed out really well because I don't want it to mark my scene with steel so once I have everything wiped off and nice and clean on this will dry place tricky so I just dry it with my hand towel just to kind of buff it into a nice shiny polish and I'll buff this stainless steel that I wiped down and that's that so my stove is clean and ready for my next cooking adventure so definitely recommend this this is also really good for cleaning the glass window in my oven door so I'll use it for that so ceramic right and the mini scrapers so that is my tips for cleaning a glass-top stove if you have some awesome tips leave them in the comments some people were leaving comments in the other video as well but I think this would be a great way for us to learn from each other so thank you so much for watching please give the video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time [Music] ",

        "content": "hey guys when we for our house we got brand-new appliances it's great it looks modern the problem is these things get dirty really easily but there are a couple of ways you can clean off that gunk we get stuck on your glass stovetop alright so the first thing to do just get the surface grime off it gets you a spray bottle with some hot water and spray that all over it just to get some boost and stuff off there then I like to do is use that water to see where stuff is caked on and use a razor blade razor blades are a hot topic on cleaning glass stoves but they're totally fine if you do it perfectly don't use the corner because that will leave a scratch on your stove and just use the flat side of the blade and get it as close to flat along the stovetop as you possibly can and be totally fine so we need this to just kind of scrape off some of the surface junk that's on there and you can see you can hear it I can feel it you can see the grime coming right off of this stovetop alright after you've scraped off that surface grinder just grab yourself a paper towel and use that to clean up that gunk that I just scraped off of it up this guy thinks instantly I can see the rings on our stove and it looks a hundred times better already but you can still see that there's some some stuff that's not necessarily baked on stuff it's just kind of grimy less kcon that's hard stuff and we're going to use some liquid pantry items to get that last bit of stuff off there alright so the next thing we're going to try on this burner right here is a mixture of hot water and lemon juice lemon juice is a very acidic compound rather pantry and we'll help cut through some of that grease this is one of the two methods we're going to try we're going to just take a lemon to hot water to make sure and squirt it on this side of our stove that sit on there for a second and then we're just going to wipe it off here in a minute alright so now we've let it sit here for a couple of minutes and now we're just going to use a cloth to rub this up and I can see a lot of it came off but a little bit still on there so I'm just going to do it again and I can feel the olden grease and grime has now been pulled up there's a little bit now that I've cleaned it up and been able to determine what's grease and grime and what's hard stuff caked on I can see there's a little bit more on the outside of the ring needs to be scraped off but we'll go back to that in a little bit after we check this set all right the next method we're going to do is hot water with vinegar and then we're going to spread some baking soda over the top don't combine these you'll get a high school ball kano but when used in moderation and use separately they will work well to break down those enzymes and get it clean so here we go first we're going to do like we did with the lemon juice and cover this done at the top water and vinegar and then let that break down for a couple of them alright now we're going to wipe that let that vinegar hot water off and cut through that door I'm it's stuck on there we'll elbow grease just like the lemon juice a lot of it came up there you can see it press up but we're going to need a little bit more on their so the vinegar doesn't quite get everything off as well as the lemon juice does so we're going to do now just like spritz of the hot water and lemon juice or hot water and vinegar we're going to take some baking soda and just lightly sprinkle that over the surface here and that's going to work to break down some grease and ground that's still on there after the lemon juice so let that sit for a couple minutes and i'ma wipe this clean okay so we've got the baking show to sit for about ten minutes and now we're just gonna take a wet cloth and wipe this stuff up and so that did a pretty good job to get use the baking soda after the vinegar the vinegar by itself doesn't do as good as a job as the lemon juice does myself once you add the vinegar or the baking soda that really helps it out so I'm looking at it now and it looks so much better but like I said over here that really got the difference between some grime and some hard stuff that's still caked on so I'm just going to use the scraper now and just scrape off the last little bits of residue that I can still see and that's next elapsed up right after you scraped off the last of the remaining junk just get you a white or wet paper towel into a final wipe to get all the remaining lemon juice vinegar baking soda residual scraping all that stuff off Wow just look at how much better that stove looks literally could even see any rooms before so I hope this video helped you to figure out how to clean your glass electric stovetop we try to number a different ways and if you

        "content": "right right hands although they're calloused in the moving houses for 12 years I still like to protect my hands every chance I get and next thing I'm going to do is before I even go I'm going to go ahead and clean my cooktop with just the cleaner just to kind of show you um you know how it's there's grease I know you really probably can't see that on this video but there is like grease everywhere I'm I'm one of the messiest cooks so I'm going to spray some of my cleaner I'm just gonna start the top cuz I got a little a de here and saw some some grease splatter up here so cleaning room real quick okay to polishing that a little bit later but now I'm just been pissed and just kind of wipe and I will show you my paper towel and show you how much even without the new glass that this will bring news just with one little spray I haven't let it sit very long and I already have a bunch of little yuppies in my paper towel I'm gonna go home like but just one more time just to get anything else that was on there and I still of course have some of these harder to remove Krusty's that are on my glass cooktop I don't know if you could see there's these there's these and then of course around the ring I'm gonna try to turn on a light see if you can see that a little bit better around the ring of these glass glass cooktop stoves I don't know if you struggle with that but I do or have and these will bubbles form a lot of people think that it is something that they cannot remove and so people literally go their entire the entire lifespan of the stove or however long they have that stuff thinking that they can't remove this and I'm going to show you how so it's not only gonna remove you know the stuff that I just cooked on there but it's gonna remove some of the stuff that I kind of let sit over time and so I'm gonna start with a paper towel and I wouldn't fold it up just a little bit I don't want to put about a quarter size of the new glass on there and I'm gonna take this and very liberally I am going to just rub it all over especially the ring areas those little bubble trouble trouble bubble areas that that we're trying to remove and then you know some of this stains this is going to get it off Tuesday I've done this so many many many many times and I have a lot of clients that are just amazed at the outcome they thought that their stove was stained and then they couldn't get those stains off and today I'm going to show you how so I just kind of liberally glazed over the stove and then I'm going to take my little scrubber I'm at non-scratch I don't like the scrap the scotch brite the heavy-duty ones just in case it might scratch the glass um I used to use them and I didn't really have a whole lot of scratching with it's best to using on scratch they work very very well so I'm going to take my non-scratch and I'm going to scrub and I can already see you some of this crud coming up even with just this part you could entirely skip this step but I find that it's it's just better and it tends to kind of break up some of this stuff before I even use my razor blade on it um so now it's not coming up completely with this guy right so now you can see some of that crap that I got off there that's after wiping it two times it's a paper towel and that's some crazies that I got off with just the new glasses stuck right and now I'm going to take my razor blade that I have you want to be really really careful um but I take this this is like a little rubber grippy I got these at Walmart so they're really good they you don't have to worry about your little fingers and everything's made this little thing holds the razor blade really well for me I am going to scrape the glass I'm not plot applying a whole lot of pressure you really don't need to wit the razor blade it pretty much will do most of the work for you [Music] you come over here and come and get around this ring around where those [Music] these little bubbles trouble areas if people think that that's it won't go away sometimes I have to look a little bit closer cuz I'm blind not literally but just six and then go over all the Rings very simple but now as far as what I can see I think I got most of the bubbles off then I'm gonna go ahead and spray again with my offer Pittsburghers and went off this will give me a little bit of a looser look there is an edge spot just in case you see that I do have an edge spot on my glass cooktop stove that I've never been able to get out makes me sad happen when my husband let the Tabor too long and not the throw him under the bus but a couple little edge spots in this particular burner over here and that is all that you have to do to get your glass cooktop step I don't know if you can bring it closer and kind of see where the bubbles were they no longer exist they are completely gone this new glass is all that I use besides my homemade cleaner which is the recipe like I said it's very simple and it is on my website jill trades calm this this is the magic stuff because I have tried this method with just a razor blade and no scotch brite or anything just the razor blade and it's not as easy it feels like I'm gonna scratch the glass you need this stuff go buy it click down below the link is there for you and I hope that this little video helps you in making your glass cooktop stove look and kill it have a great day ",

        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "hi guys my name is Bill today in this video I'm going to show you how to clean a glass top stove I'm going to show you the method that I use I'm going to answer some questions that I have on a previous video that I made like four years ago on the same exact stove that's kind of why I want to redo this video make a little bit newer version and answer some questions and also at the end of this video I want to show you how I remove the screws that were seized into the bottom of the oven the held the bottom oven pan in so you can get to the bake element I'm going to show you how I got those out a couple of you guys asked and I said I'd show you so I'm going to show you the end all right so let's take a look at the top of the stove I'm going to try the best I can this is the big burner on the front left you can see there's a little bit of a ring around the edge of the burner I haven't cleaned it yet this is how I got it and you can see all the scratches I'm just kind of giving you like a before here notice how the center of these burners are real black this one here is kind of hazy the turbo burner it's got like a white like a white haze to it a bunch of big scratches a little bit of grease going around the edge not too bad real quick guys before I start cleaning let me answer a few concerns that you guys had on a previous video that I've made that made the video like four years ago there's half a million views and probably one of the most common responses on that video are where people use baking soda to clean their glass top stove well I've never used baking soda to clean so I can't compare the difference between baking soda and the glass top cleaner but I would suggest that if you do use the baking soda to still go ahead and use the glass top cleaner that you're supposed to use on the glass top because it adds the polish at the end whenever you buff the top it makes the top real smooth and it helps for future cleaning now to really get after this thing and scrub it like I'm like I'm going to show you the best method I think for cleaning the glass top stove you probably don't have to do that every single time you use it I'd say a couple times a month to get everything on there that you've accumulated over the over the use of them you know the month but so it's probably not necessary to do this every single time because when you're using the glass top cleaner the grease will clean up for the most part a lot better than if you just use baking soda so that's my thought on baking soda the other comment that I got was with scratchy pads and razor blades so I found the most abrasive scratchy pad that I could find and I'm going to clean the top with this and I'm going to scrub the heck out of it and we're going to see if it if it scratches it all up so I don't know if you guys are just being extra extra weeny about it I don't know what you guys problem is with worrying about a little scratchy pad I mean you seen how many scratches were on the top of this thing after I think about five years of use so I this was the exact stove that was in the original video that I made four years ago it went to somebody I gave it to him would I give it to him for nothing so they were going to give it back to me whenever they finally either bought a new one or whatever so they wouldn't bought a new stove so they gave this one back to me which was really nice and it's still in pretty good shape and you see after that many years of use what the bottoms of the pans actually does to the top a lot of you guys might have opinions on that on how they're kind of garbage and stuff like that which can't really disagree I mean it's really hard to keep them in perfect brand-new condition when you're using it almost every single day so I don't think the green scratchy pads probably your highest concern when it comes to cleaning but we're going to find out if it scratches it anyway and I'm going to use a razor blade if I have to I'll probably just demonstrate the razor blade use anyway even if I don't need to so now let's get into cleaning so when you get ready to clean the stove these are probably the supplies that you're going to need a little scratching pad some cooktop cleaner some paper towels and a razor blade and you'll want to make sure the razor blade is brand new you don't want to use a used blade that has jagged edges or anything like that just make sure you use a new blade when you do this all right so let's start clean up you want to put enough one that you can spread it around and cover the whole top you're going to feel areas that are real clean and real smooth then you're going to feel areas that are real rough and that's where the grease is and you definitely want to spend more time on the rough areas where the grease is then the smooth areas this stop wasn't so bad and remember this isn't something you have to do every single time that you use the stove maybe a couple times a month to get it back to good shape all right now that we got this scrubbed in this will probably take most of the grease off but there are going to be some areas around the burners that are pretty caked on and that's where you want to use the razor blade especially if you're scraping on a spot and it just will not come clean then you want to take your razor blade and this will not take the line off of the burner people are always concerned about that and you won't scrape that line off and this here was the burner that had the ring so we'll go around this one and that's pretty good so we'll describe it one more time and the top already feels a lot smoother so now this is where you want to grab your paper towels and wipe off all the excess and you can see there's a little bit of grease now that I got most of it off its kind of hazy a little bit so I'm going to grab a clean paper towel and then buff it till it shines like that now let's take a closer look at it okay so here's a look at the top after we cleaned it and you can see there's not much of a difference it was in pretty good shape there's still a little bit of haziness inside the big burner here but the ring of grease that was around it is gone and I think this one up here had a little bit of a ring and it's completely removed now the top does feel a lot smoother than what it was and that's because of the polish but as you can see it didn't do anything for these big scratches and if we try to look real close there's no there's just scratches from the pan if I can get to focus here but there's not tiny little scratches from the scratchy bed or the razor blade I'm having a hard time focusing here so that's a look at the top after we clean it now what I want to try to do on this burner with all the haziness is use some rubbing compound on it and see if I can buff out the haziness this is the setup that I'm going to use a little bit of rubbing compound and a buffer wheel on my drill and I'm going to try to remove the fall that's on I don't know if it's going to work or not but I just want to try it so let's put some of this on there I'll rub that around put a little bit of water on it spread that in real good you want to use the drill on low speaks I'm sure this is going to be messy you don't want to fling this all over your walls and yourself and everything else so we'll get that spread around like that alright so let's clean this up and see if it made any difference alright so I'm looking at the burner after using the rubbing compound it definitely took some of the haze out so I'd imagine if I had some maybe some rougher compound or spent more time on this burner I think the rest of the haze would go away let me show you a close-up look alright so here's a closer look at the burner and in the center and down towards the bottom here looks a little better but there's still a lot a lot of haze around the around the edge of the burner here towards the line so I don't know how effective that would be if you wanted to do the whole top but it looks like it worked a little bit I'm gonna put a link in the video description to a guy who does a better job at doing this than I did he uses some sort of metal polish and a buffer wheel kind of like I did but I'm not sure how the metal polish works if you guys have any suggestions or any thoughts on glass stop cleaning let me know in a comment section I'm definitely interested in hearing your guys's experiences and how it works for you and what you think is the best method so if you liked the video go ahead and give it a thumbs up if you're not subscribed to my youtube channel go ahead and do that now and thanks for watching oh that's right you guys wanted to see how to remove those screws let me show you the tools that I used first all right so here's the tools that I used I used two Phillips head and if you look at the head of the screw it's very rounded so someone must have had this apart before but I was able to get like a tiny bit of a turn on it just enough that I could grip just underneath the head of the screw with my dikes and give it a couple turns once I could give it a couple turns I just run this under and cut the head off and then all I did from that point was take this grip it with a pair of vise grips and turn it out of the bracket so I didn't even mess the screws up but I could get a real good grip on this with some vise grips and I didn't damage the threads on the bracket underneath and that's how I was able to put two new 832 screws back into the bracket and just replace the screws so that's how he did that ",

I buff the stove up like this every single night and then I'll take my finger and just kind of rub it all up around the top to see if I feel anything it's feeling pretty good so now I'll go on over to this side now I'm just putting little striations there and then again just kind of fill it and it's still in nice and smooth right now sometimes I'll dampen my furniture just because this cream polish will start to dry so now I'll grab some paper towels and I like the vive paper towels that feel like cloth and I'll just grab them and just start to wipe it off oh it's that night noticed it was quiet and I realize I'm got heard a load of wash running and I was hearing it in the background so now take a look at what you see so let me get all this off and then I'll bring it up a little closer so you can see it there's still a little bit right there I can feel that right there and right there when we look at this side [Music] I don't feel anything over here but right there and right there so let me if I give that another scrub and you could put more cream on there if you need to or you can use what's already in your sponge I can still feel some right in there now this is the time to get out my scraper and I just scraped very very lightly where I can feel something that's where I scraped see that came right up and I do this every night so part of my after dinner clean up after I get the dishwasher loaded get the floor swept food put away I buff up the stove and when you do it every night it doesn't take a long time and actually it can be just a little bit therapeutic it's a little piece of something there and then I just give it a good buffing with a dry paper towel and like I said I use the vive cloth like and they are just wonderful for this particular purpose here's my freshly buffed and polished smooth top stove this is the care kit that we got when we bought the stove there was a small bottle like this that was in this box you can see I purchased this larger one but we got this scraper and this sponge actually there were three sponges in here and I cut them into thirds and I just use a small piece at a time like this and they work beautifully so there may be other products out there that you can use and if there are tell me about it I'd be interested in trying some of them out but so far I've stuck with what the manufacturer recommended well there you have it there's the best way to clean a smooth top stove so now my question for you is which part of this process did you find most interesting tell me about it in the comment section below I would love to hear from you or if you have a better way for keeping your smooth top stove clean and shiny let me know sometimes the best ideas come from right here in the TNT community so let's get a good conversation gone and just so you know I've raised three children I've managed a home for more than 45 years and I am a nurse by profession so if you want to learn more about cooking cleaning laundry planning and health and beauty subscribe I would love to have you as a member of the TNT community in the mean time this is Denise Jordan saying goodbye I'll see you in the next video [Music] ",

        "content": "hey guys so today I'm going to be showing you how I clean my electric stove top it gets so so dirty especially since today is Friday the day after Thanksgiving it's just like baked on caked on mess and I'm going to do a deep clean of the stovetop I just use a couple of ingredients that you probably already have around the house I use baking soda white vinegar I do use a magic eraser just to get those like hard to like scrub spots or you could use any kind of other scrubber that you have you just want to make sure it's not going to scratch the surface of your glass stovetop so I just use a magic eraser just to kind of get any hard to remove dirt after the vinegar mixture has soaked a little bit I also do use a scrub daddy if you haven't ever had a scrub daddy before they are perfect for any kind of mess that's really really baked on they just are great then I get mine a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond they're super cheap my mom brought me one yesterday so I'm gonna be using that then I'm excited about but other than that that is really all you need to use you can add other things if you have a really hard stay intern move may add a little bit of salt to the mixture as just like a what's the word hey you know to like scrub the spot more what is that word I'll let you know when it comes to my mind but anyway I'm going to be using some baking soda white vinegar and some salt just to really get the stuff off the top it's it's really bad so I'm gonna bring you over to my stovetop and show you what it looks like and I will show you the ingredients that we're gonna be using today so there's a little bit of a glare so it makes it a little tough to see but you can see that like right here I have probably like gravy or something really really really baked on I this morning made bacon and didn't realize that there was stuff there still so I had the stovetop on and it just was burning and getting worse and worse so that's why I decided to go ahead and clean the oven today there are some spots that you're most likely never gonna get out and that's any kind of scratches or surface scratches that you have from just using the same burner all the time I usually use this one because it's like hottest one it boils fast and things like that so this is the one I use a lot so it gets a lot of grime caked on and that's really it so I'm going to go ahead and make my mixture and add it to the top of my glass stovetop so these are the ingredients that we are going to be using to clean our stove top I'm just going to be using today some white vinegar some baking soda and I try to buy the big box because I use it for cooking and cleaning and I use it a lot for cleaning like my sink my stovetop anything that has like a really nasty mess I am gonna be using some salt just to have some extra grit to clean it off and also if you do this salt is just like the fine just like table salt but if you have like a coarse salt that might work better I'm also using my last and very much used magic eraser I do need to get some more I have a scrub daddy here it has a like harder side and then it just has like a spongy side and a bowl to mix my mixture in you don't need too much so I'm just gonna use a little bit make a paste and go from there so let's add our ingredients I'm just gonna eyeball it there's really no to me there's no right or wrong way to make this I'm gonna be adding probably about a teaspoon of salt I'm going to get a spoon for my baking soda going to add about a teaspoon to probably two teaspoons of baking soda hopefully it doesn't explode and [Music] let's see how this is gonna go a little bit of vinegar at it very slowly otherwise you are going to have a volcanic eruption and I'm just adding enough I'm just adding enough to make a paste that I can spread on top of the stovetop and now just going to dump this on the stovetop and get any extra out of the bowl you want to make sure that you have your sponge and your Magic Eraser damn cuz they they obviously work best that way and I'm just going to spread this out all over the top really focusing on any areas that have a lot of residue and I am just going to let that sit there I'm just gonna let this sit here for like five minutes you can if you want grab a washcloth and have it like be warm and nice and damp and lay it on top it will just kind of help make everything loosen up so when you go to scrub it's not so difficult to remove but for now I'm just gonna let this do its thing and I'll come back in five minutes and we'll go ahead and scrub okay so now I'm gonna go ahead with my scrub daddy sponge and go ahead and just kind of gently with the scrubby side go over it I'm not putting too much pressure because I don't want to scratch the surface of my stovetop but I am gonna focus primarily on any spots that really really have a lot of cooked on grease or any kind of anything stuck to it the swatch to this yesterday before Thanksgiving which was kind of silly because I knew it was just gonna end up getting dirty but I didn't want to have a double the dirt baked on so once I do that I'm going to switch to my magic eraser which is so used I should really go ahead and get another one there are certain spots that are on here that have been on for a while and they're just like wear and tear spots so they're not going to come up very well with any scrubbing if you feel like you need a little bit of extra cleaner you can always add a little bit of dish soap which is really good too I'll just add like a little bit of dawn and just it kind of just helps pick up any grease I am going to go ahead and add just a little bit of dawn because it's a little worse than I thought it was and I just think that will add a little bit of extra cleaning power to our mixture [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright now I'm just gonna get a paper towel and wipe everything up see where I'm at [Music] all right so everything's wiped up there's just a little bit of the baking soda residue you can see as it's drying it turns a little bit white I'm gonna go ahead and take a vinegar spray that I just have is like a DIY all-purpose cleaner it's just a little bit of olds half maybe 3/4 white vinegar to a what did I say yeah 3/4 white vinegar 1/4 water and a couple drops of lemon essential oils and I'm just gonna spray that on top this is just an all-purpose cleaner I use it for everything all over my house [Music] so this is the after everything looks really good there's still a glare so it's hard to see but all that caked on stuff came off it was so crusty and baked on you can see by the sponge that I used that it picked up a lot of gross Ness same with my magic eraser I'm gonna have to really scrub these guys but it worked really really well this is something I do once a week to really just do a deep clean of my stovetop because it can just get so just nasty and that was it for today's video I hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to let us know in the comments below if you used this cleaning method and how it worked for you if you have a better cleaning method please let me know I would love to try it out and we will see you guys next time namely okay come here be nice don't hit the camera here you want to watch you want to be on the camera you want to be on the camera sit nicely yeah alright that is it for today's video don't forget to subscribe to our channel we post new videos self you don't see yourself no no his plan might fail you want to see yourself yeah there you are [Laughter] ",

        "content": "hey guys welcome back to my channel in today's video I'll be showing you guys how I clean my stovetop this is a very highly requested video you guys have sent me messages left comments down below asking me how I keep my stovetop clean so I decided to make a video showing you guys exactly the products that I use to keep my stovetop clean to start I want to start by letting you guys know that I've had this stove for six years we purchased it in 2012 when we first moved into our house so it's been about six years since I've had it so the first thing I do to keep it clean is when I'm cooking whenever I have any spills while while I cook I usually use disposable or a reusable paper or towel or whatever and get it wet in some water and as I'm cooking I just kind of wipe off the spills just so it's not a heavy-duty cleaning when it's time for me to clean my stool so as you're cooking just wipe off whatever spills on your stovetop but the main thing that I do use to clean my stove is this cleaning paste that I got from Norwex my neighbor actually sell this stuff but I'm sure if you google it you can try to find it online even on Amazon you might find it on Amazon but it's really really good just clean your stuff top it's a paste it comes like this and I've had this for at least five years it goes a long ways so what I normally do I would normally get my stovetop wet and then take some of that paste and just break it up and I would use a wet cloth and just basically scrub my stovetop and this should not scratch it at all at all and as you can see it's getting read it's getting rid of a lot of the stuff on there you guys can see that so then you just want to go ahead and wipe it off and another thing that I use if I have really stubborn dirt that won't come off I use a piece of this SOS sponge or I don't know what you call this but I'll leave the picture so you guys can see it but anyways I get it wet it already have soap in it and I just lightly scrub that part and it will not scratch your stovetop if you lightly do it the only reason I have the scratches like I said it's because I mean the stove I had for six years like I said it's not going to stay brand new especially I do a lot of cooking so of course it's not going to be new forever it's going to get some type of scratch so now all you want to do is just wipe it off and of course you want to get no clean water and just clean off your stove so I'm gonna go ahead and dump this water and then come back and show you guys how it looks okay guys this is the pad that I was using it's called brillo I thought it was my SOS which is almost the same thing but my stuff now is nice and clean like I said you have some scratches of course I use heavy duty pots to cope with but for the most part this is all I use and thank you guys for requesting that video and please don't forget to go check me out on Facebook Instagram and come snap with me on snapchat and of course on Twitter and I will leave the link for those down in the description box and this will do it for this video guys please don't forget to subscribe to the channel comment like and please please share this video and it's always thank you guys so so much for watching if this video was helpful please give it a big thumbs up and I love you guys for watching see you in my next video bye bye [Music] ",

        "content": "so to make your stovetop cleaner you're going to need some water baking soda dish soap tea tree oil and a little bit of vinegar so the first thing you're going to do is take a glass jar not a plastic one because the tea tree oil will eat through a plastic container so make sure that it's glass and you're going to fill it up about halfway with baking soda then you're going to take your dish soap and you're going to put a layer of dish soap just like that it's really just a few squirts the finished jet dry seems to expand so maybe I'd say a quarter of an inch layer of dish soap on top of your baking soda next you're going to take your tea tree oil and you're going to add 15 drops to the baking soda and dish though take a stick to stir with and just mix it in with the baking soda take your vinegar at this point and just put a little drop in don't put too much because your container will overflow and then add in your water so you're just going to pour a little bit at a time and then stir add a little bit more and stir again so you'll know your solution is ready when it's fairly easy to stir but it's still relatively thick with baking soda if you let your solution sit for any length of time it will separate in the baking soda will go to the bottom and all the liquid would go to the top so before you use it again just make sure you stir it up and then just use a tablespoon to pour the solution over your stove top be sure to use this solution with a scouring pad that's made specifically for glass stove tops because any other type of scouring pad will scratch the top of your stove so last night my husband made chicken and he fried it in a frying pan on the stove so this morning we have spots on the burner where the frying pan was and if we move over here to the edge of the burner you can see all of the grease splatter that came off the chicken so that's what I've been having a really hard time getting off because it hardens and it's really hard to get off even with the store-bought cleaner so we're going to shake up our homemade clean make sure the baking soda is all mixed in really well take a spoon and just sprinkle it over the stove now I'm going to take our red scouring pad and just start to scrub all the dirt and stuck on grease off of the stove once you're done scrubbing you're going to take a wet dishcloth and you're going to just take all of that baking soda off the top of the stove and now you're going to take a dry dish towel and buff the top of the stove until it's dry and there it is you're perfectly clean glass stovetop everyone today just want to do a quick tutorial on how to easily remove stitches from a whole town or any straight stitch that you've sewn and you need to take out of your damage whatever project you're working ",

        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "okay so I wanted to show you how to clean your glass cooktop stove and I'm going to show you how I use what I use I use this which is just a glass cooktop heavy-duty cleaner and polish this is really good when you use this it repels longer so that you don't have to clean it quite as often okay so it's been a little while since I've done mine and this is like we're pasta water boiled over all over the stove and so I'm going to show you how to get that off okay so basically what you're going to need is your cooktop cleaner I also have this you can use this this is supposed to be daily cleaner that you use like after you cook I don't really find that it's that great or word the it's five dollars a bottle and to me I can get just as good just wiping it down with you know a wet sponge or something and then drying it off a soapy sponge so but I do like this this is where the the price word I think and because it works really good I have done the baking soda and peroxide and you mix it together make like a little paste and put it all over this and then use your razor blade that works pretty good also but it doesn't have the stuff in it to kind of repel to protect it against getting dirty so fast so that's one of the reasons we're using this so what you're going to do once you get all the grease and everything off you can take a little bit my lid stopped up so I'm just going to kind of take the lid off and so you really probably don't need quite that much so what you're going to do then is just kind of rub it all over your stove and I have to hold my camera and while I do this I'm just going to get one of the kids to do it but I thought you know it'd probably be worse to have them holding it bouncing all over the place and they probably don't want to watch me clean my stove so what you're doing is just getting this all over your stove okay and a bottle of this last quanta while you normally don't use quite as much as I did when you squirt it out of the lid but this is going to work really good okay so all you're doing is you're going to work around and you would use a like one of the little scrubby sponge top scrubbers but you would not want to use anything metal for abrasive the most abrasive thing we're going to use is a clean razor blade and it's not going to scratch and then you hear my kids and loot them Katyn so that's why I didn't want to hold my camera so anyway scrub this as much as you can even with your little scrubby sponge you're not going to get all of it off and that's ok because that's what the razor blades for so um use a good new razor blade and all you're going to do is going in one direction I start with going back and forth in the same direction and I just scrape or all of that was and then if that direction doesn't work then I come back and go in the other direction so kind of I'm just trying not to make it at different angles I don't you know let this slip or something and scratch my stove but this is not going to scratch your stove and it's not going to take the little white lines off your stove around the burners or anything like that as long as you're using a good new razor blade not one that's you know rusted or anything like that than that you know I can't promise you that that won't scratch it though but this is how I always do mine because if you don't use the razor blade it's not going to get all of this and it's not going to look quite as good we're going to make it look just practically new pretty close to new so you can already kind of see how much better it's looking and so you just keep doing this and so what I'm going to do is sit my camera down so that I can really kind of do it hopefully you can see that and I'm just doing that same thing just scratching it rather than a second for it enough scratching it sorry stripe in it and don't worry about it sounding like that that's okay if you can see okay and just go and what you want to do is every you're just going to kind of feel with like your sponge or something you can feel or even your hand you can tell where those spots are if they've come up or not even though you know like I can still I can rub my hand over and tell if there's like a little rough area and I know that when I got my stove the directions you know call it set called for the stove cleaner the lien I like what I showed you and doesn't say anything about using a razor blade or anything but I just can't not get it to stay even if I clean it everything you know perfectly every time and I don't make enough spill overs and stuff this is a kind of hottest claim so the razor blade really gets all of this other stuff all I say is the dozen ones aren't quite as bad and I'm just a kind of a quick version so I mean you know I don't want to run from my battery ran out on me and quit quick as I can and hopefully did it you have to look pretty good so you're just gonna cut it like I don't use this so I know there's probably it's the warmer I notice I'm gonna be really any areas there now my stove is a little over a year old about a year and three months old I think and when I clean it it still practically looks new my oven is still really nice because um it's got the self-cleaning oven and stuff on it just be careful the brush bugs don't let it slip and you know get your hand or something okay so I'm going to use my floss here to clean this up a little bit and we're not going to take all of it off yet just yet so we're kind of kind of just do a rough gathering of all of the most of the liquid here not quite all of it or the cleaner okay so now I'm going to get see if I have this okay top two things sorry this my trash bag door okay I'm going to use that's our dirty one that I started with okay so I'm going to use this we're going to kind of go over some of this a little bit areas and then we're going to buff if we need that we're going to use the other one at the end we're going to buff with this one or we're going to kind of scrub with this one little bit more and then I use the other one to finish up with mmm so right now I'm just kind of buffing it around make sure we got all of these little areas and and if I missed any you know kind of using this little extra cleaner going around and you'll have to kind of go back around the edges like where the stove edges are before it's like siliconed or whatever there okay okay so we're at this point now I'm going to take my microfiber cloth and I'm just going to buff it a little bit and reason we're doing this is to get all of this little cloudiness off sorry still kind of shaking it all over the place and then get all your little corners again or all that white stuff kind of seeps in and that's pretty much it so we went from pretty much looking pretty junky to almost look I'm pretty new again so give that a try and just buff you want to buff all of this to get all of that white haze off of it and then just maintain it and do this every couple of weeks and you'll keep your stove looking pretty pretty new looking thank you ",

        "content": "hello this is Katherine Davis independent norwex consultant one of the things that I hear most frequently is that it's kind of confusing the different variety of claws that are available for helping in the kitchen so I figure that I would do a little demo to demonstrate how a few of the options for kitchen cleaning can work for you and I quite conveniently have a very messy glass top stove here complete with stainless steel kettle there so hopefully we can have a good look at how these different claws can work to solve your different kitchen cleaning problems I'm going to set the camera down over here so you can see while I work there we go okay there it is all right so first a least costly option will be the dish cloth here it's a very simple white mesh mine is not quite white that's because I use it for cleaning tasks um it's quite large so in order to use it you simply fold it to a size that's comfortable in your hand and all of my clothes are pretty moistened and it's really good at getting big particles up easily and trapping them there in the cloth so for jobs where you just need to pick up some big particles and do a little bit of scrubbing that's a great option and I also use mine all the time for wiping down my dishes before I put them in the dishwasher it holds a lather very well so it's a great tool for cleaning your dishes this is the kitchen cloth and graphite and it's not very large it's a great size to have in your hand it's very convenient to use for cleaning your kitchen it's the same microfiber that is used in the enviro clubs but it has more of a Ridge surface and that gives it a little bit more scrubbing power but it also makes it so the food particles that you may pick up with it rinse out really easily with this cloth I've picked up you know rice I picked up full-size beans off of a toddler's type skin it's very grabby and still very scrubbing so I'll just show that right here and it also lets say that was a sterling wipe with that it got a lot up already although we still have some stubborn more baked-on stuff that we'll get to in a moment but I also love this cloth a lot for cleaning up stainless let me make sure that bats you can see just one simple pass it around this kettle and this kettle it's been sitting unloved here for a little while so it's got all kinds of oil baked on to it but the kitchen crafts being a great multi-purpose cloth just cleans it up really really easily and put a very nice shine on it so now it's ready to live back on the corner of my stove and it won't be an eyesore with that oil dry it on it any longer and it just use this to pick up some of the bigger particles and I've got some sauce right onto the counter let me clean that up you've been busy and you see how much of those bigger particles there's rice on there and a little bit of it will drop off but it holds it really well until you I'm going to shake it off in the sink I'm going to hold onto this because I want to show you something else with it in a moment the next option for really great scrubbing is the kitchen scrub cloth and you can see that it's sort of a checkerboard pattern with microfiber and these shiny little bits are actually more microfiber fibers encased in sort of a plastic and that is what makes them really scrubby so this is still our awesome microfiber and it goes to work on those dried on bits so well then it brings that shine back to the glass top stove with just water that's all this on this and I'm going to wipe down my touch-up in here to sorts of splatter on it as well coming along nicely you can see it also grabs and holds those bigger particles pretty well so you don't need to worry about them falling on the floor alright so I'm gonna pick up a camera and to show you we that stove is looking pretty good oh no it's your toe okay okay good I'm glad alright so the stove top is looking a whole lot better but you can see it still has some of those stubborn areas where the grease is just baked on or charred on or whatever so I'm going to show you what I what you can do with you Norwex to get rid of those spots so have a few different options just depending on what your price point is or what products you might already have and this is an enviro cloth it's going to go over it one more time this is a really finely woven very dense cloth and so it picks up a lot more of that small stuff you can see it's already little dirty but this is a special one this is our scrubby corner cloth so in addition to being an awesome enviro it has the scrubby on the corner and also a little pocket on the side for you to put your hand in it so you can use it plain just as it is and this is also already wet I read everything before my videos and it does a great job of scrubbing just on its own but where it was really powerful is if you put some of our cleaning paste on it got the cleaning paste over here and I'm just wiping some up with the scrubby corner cloth and it just eliminates try it on baked on grimy bits with just three ingredients a cleaning paste is composed of marble flour traces of coconut oil and natural soap so it's a very very very eco-friendly option especially when used with just water so that's and you can see how much it got up there and the enviro picked quite a bit of it up also while I was scrubbing with it and we'll give it a little wipe here oh it's beautiful on that half I want to show you you can also use the cleaning paste with the kitchen cloth and I'll do there's a you know that edge that you get around the burners that is baked on there so what's up cleaning paste and the kitchen cloth it just comes right up it's so easy you don't have to put a whole bunch of muscle into it you don't have to scrub and scrub for ages and ages it just comes up I will help you in a moment baby but mommy's working right now you and I get up in the carrier and help okay just one moment if you guys don't mind wait is it get my Bibble assistant Cappy him up leave just a moment do you see how pretty our stove is always yeah we're friend can you talk about our quads yeah yeah you want to tell them do you like to use the cloth yeah washcloth yeah yeah these are our very special washcloths yeah all right sorry about that um but so now we have one half of my stove that is very shiny and pretty and just showing you two different options for getting the shininess back on your soap right and no no no more nest baby and the last combination that I'm going to show you is the kitchen scrub cloth with the cleaning paste and I'll give you another quick before and after let me dry this so when the cameras on it see it really nicely and easily shiny and bright it is yeah all right so that's the side that I just cleaned and this is the one that still needs some work I'm gonna get at it I'll give it another preliminary scrub here and then maybe maybe what the cleaning paste is a solid so it only takes a very little bit to be very effective at cleaning it just lasts for ages and ages and ages all right so my burner here is wet I have my kitchen scrub cloth is cleaning paste on it and Wow it just makes such quick work of it you can hardly believe it the kitchen scrub buff on its own is very effective but the cleaning pace just takes it to a whole other level see how fast and easy that is gonna get a tiny little bit more paste here how about Cuchillo vert you don't think you're going to have any peach yogurt today baby you ate your yogurt earlier and that's the other really wonderful thing about all of our Norwich's products you don't have to worry about using them around your child we're going to worry about picking them up after you've been cleaning there's nothing on your hands or in the air that you wouldn't want them exposed to Wow and it's so much faster than the other creams that I used to use on this stove and we'll give it another wipe at the enviro and then I'll dry with the kitchen towel there yeah five five what how are you holding up five fingers on your hand and here is the grand finish ",

Bronner's this is castile soap organic really wonderful all-purpose cleaner very concentrated so you don't need very much and I can make a lot of squirt bottles with one of these bottles this is a smaller bottle it's like 14.95 here in Canada but you can get them online for fairly decent price so check on Amazon so bottle of water fill the water up first if you use hot water that'll make your job even a little bit easier and just squirt squirt so just a couple squirts and now I have a whole bottle of cleaner and those couple squirts didn't really cost that much so it's really economical economical it's cheap so first things first is I don't want to hurt myself on the glass shards so I'm going to vacuum Oh glass shards I'd rather in the back and get hurt than me my bottle of dr. Bronner's in in water look at that there's there's just it's everywhere anyways I'm gonna spray this down just give it a really good liberal squirt you know you don't want to be squirting directly on wires and stuff like that 'ti stuff so I'm just gonna let that sit for a minute the magic tub most cleaning is loud everything sit for a moment spray sit spray sit don't try to do more work than you have to so I'm ready to get this stove underneath a little wipe now a vacuum did Oh got all of the glass shirt out and now I don't know whether you're gonna be able to see this or not but that doesn't lie that's just taking it all off really quite easily you know I'm able to get most of the the debris off and that was with an organic cleaner the dr. Bronner's and no real huge scrubbing and if there's some really nasty areas I can use the SOS pads this is kind of an old-fashioned clean air kind of thing I don't use them very often but this is metal under here or something and and if I take this and I just give the tough areas now this one's not even wet I'm just giving it just a little scrub and it got it off sometimes it's better wet sometimes it's better dry so you can try both ways and you know if you're concerned about scratching don't use SOS pads and you don't want to use it for all surfaces this is underneath I don't have much free of doing any damage so a little bit of dr. Bronner's I'm a spray bottle and then follow it up on the tough spots with an ass West pad it's gonna come out as clean and good as new so as you can see it came out pretty good so now to put your stove down these little handles you just take and pull them it's kind of like a car idea you know put them like that push on them a little bit and then it will slide back down give it a tap and it will lock into place so the element that have the explosion on it it has got some stuff that's on there pretty good so I took a just a little brush and I brushed off the worst of it but I am just going to write it with some dr. Bronner's mixing water that's my spray bottle your hands up badly what is some dishwashing liquid they change the body that's all clear now and stuff but honestly if order your community without using I raise my hands a total and it looks so good on so many other that it's just a must happen and thank goodness for the drip pan inserts I put an insert in this one so when my dish exploded it went into the insert that was in here and there was barely anything left on the outside now the element that was a totally different story the element was just beyond help looking I sprayed it with some dr. Bronner's and water and let it sit for a little while and it came off fairly easy I actually did put it in the sink and they caps a little wire parts out of the sink and washed it a bit now I'm not putting this back into the stove for a very long time because I need it to dry out really good nobody else seems to want to host these things I'm kind of figuring out why I know that there are some people that pull these things off like magic hello any suggestions please leave it in the comments down below Adam and I thought I was so prepared today so that didn't work but he was so gracious and like o'them you was wonderful what was that that exploded I boycott any special occasion they're not happening at my house Mother's Day we're going out there's about two minutes no more ",

        "content": "okay what's going on everybody my wife who purchased our first glass top stove about seven months ago we've been having problems trying to find an adequate cleaner to clean the glass top so I was always worried about these lines if we were going to scrape off the lines by rubbing too hard so after a couple different tribes of stuff this is the cooktop cleaner that we came up with it's called Wayman cooktop Maxx microbead scrubbing power it comes with this cool little applicator right here it's got the like this sort of feel like like metal at all feels like something different a little bit lighter than that and you got your scouring pad and there here you pull a cap off it looks like this and it smells like smells like crap smells like ah smells like bad fish smells like but don't worry about the smell because it's going to do the job so what I like to do first is is really see how dirty it is and that's there just rub a cloth over it and you can see that depths actually not that bad right here some days it's better or worse but then just take this like this like that and just rub it in a circle and you're not going to rub the lines off it and you'll know that you're doing all right job because it will feel smooth under here so any any part that feels a little rough keep doing it so it becomes nice and smooth you know I don't use any water on this I just do it like this and sometimes you know I go in the back and forth pattern especially if I want to make sure that they get everything like there's a little piece right here sometimes you got to keep scrubbing to eat it off there I said I haven't had to scratch it yet I have a couple scratches but it's not from this we had that a while ago before I even bought this go all right so if you can't get to a little area off use the other side right there just fine now and all the liquid stuff that we've been using just doesn't work okay now then I just go and I I'll take a paper towel take a quick paper towel and I'll wet paper towel just a little bit and then I'll wipe it off and it's going to come out Street don't worry about that we could take glass cleaner something like that there we go see that looks like brand-new okay so we've tried a few cleaners this is just by far the best one and the applicator that comes with it it's pretty good too there and you can see we're starting to haze up a little bit don't worry about that you know clean off your stainless steel to our glass right here just clean it all off I try to keep your stove clean especially if you have a nice stove you want to keep it clean watch your neighbors come on over and see that you don't live like a slob here but we all know how it gets when you and you're cooking and just you know you and your standard family and you get a little lazy sometimes you gotta clean it make it a habit doing a good job okay so we have our little haze right here as you can see what I'll do is I'll either just take a dry paper towel and I'll just go go over it and that will get rid of the haze here but like I said you can use glass cleaner which we have that I just you know use a good glass cleaner because glass cleaner will Street - you know Windex you can't go wrong which is standard Windex original there we go BAM like brand new so let me show you what this brand is again and let's it up off this at Lowe's and you can you're going to rinse this off that's not a problem let's go to rinse it off and your sink is nice and clean before you put it back in the package it's now really nice the back in there close the top and there you have it it's really really super super simple you don't to make it you don't over complicate it if you just go to Lowe's and buy this they might have an extra local grocery store - Wayman cooktop max with the scrubbing pad alright can't beat it yeah I mean undoubtedly it is the best stuff I've used so they're go guys you know if you like my videos go ahead and subscribe I'm trying to do you know some remodel into my house and stuff like that so just stay tuned for a couple videos because I'm doing everything myself all the stuff I'm doing I'm doing for the first time first time only you know I'm just looking at a couple of YouTube videos getting a couple tips from my friends who are contractors and stuff like that and attempting everything myself why not because I'm cheap it's because I feel that I can do the work myself without to pay a contractor big money for really nothing we can use that for vacation we could use that for different upgrades on the house so there you go guys thanks for watching ",

        "content": "hi guys welcome back to our YouTube channel today I am gonna show you how we clean our gas stove top because you gotta clean it so I figured I would take you along with me as I clean ours and I show you some special tips and tricks that I use to get it really super clean and to help it stay clean so check it out the first thing I do is I remove every single piece off of the top I still top because everything is going to get soaked and clean next we're going to put all of the burner tops and grates every single thing inside of someone soapy water now I'm gonna wipe down the top of our stovetop and you can see I have a lot of just gross food getting all these nasty pieces at the top so I actually just wiped them and put them straight on the floor and then I sweep after I get done cleaning my stovetop next I'm gonna take some baking soda and I just sprinkle it all over the top of my stovetop I know some people use their baking soda and they turn it into a paste with water I found that the dry baking soda actually works better for Abby because I take this little handy dandy mixture of vinegar water and a little bit of orange essential oil and I spray that down all over the stovetop and on top of the baking soda then I take a towel and I start to scrub scrub scrub to get up all of those little caked on pieces and to make sure that the stovetop gets SuperDuper polina with the abrasive from the baking soda and this is why I love using the straight up baking soda with a little splash of my mixture because I can really scrub you can see I'm scrubbing like really hard because there are certain spots on the stovetop where I have like caked on food and I just I feel like the more the drier the baking so it is the better I can actually get in there and get all of that stuff up off of my stovetop one really awesome tip is to take a little bit of that baking soda from the stovetop and to scrub the back area of your stovetop as you can see that I'm doing here it took a little bit from the actual stovetop area put it on the cloth and then rub the back area to make sure that that gets really really clean as well and I do the same thing for the top area of the stovetop I take a little bit of that baking soda mixture and I scrub scrub scrub the top area because I can get covered in grease and it doesn't look very well so you can see that I'm doing that right here gotta get it all clean once you're done scrubbing you want to start moving that baking soda mixture to the front area of the stovetop and then I'm going to show you one of my favorite tricks for getting your stovetop super-duper clean and getting all of this mixture off of your stovetop yep vacuum cleaner especially if you have one of these handheld ones where you can change the attachments you can easily use your vacuum cleaner to get up all of that mixture from the top of your stove top I love to put it inside the little crevices there because some of that baking soda mixture will get stuck inside of the middle and this is a really really genius way to get everything out of there and I have anything burn off on your stove the next time you use it so use your vacuum cleaner to clean your stove top it totally works once I'm done vacuuming I'd take a new and clean towel and then I wet it and then I wiped down there's still time to get off to the rest of those little pieces that may not have come up from the vacuum it's not much but it's enough where it's gonna bother me so I just go ahead and wet a clean towel and give this still top another like nice little wipe down to help me out finishing up this cleaning process okay last trick is a toothbrush I use an old toothbrush and I get around those little crevices there again I am ridiculous when it comes to cleaning myself top you don't have to go through all of those of you don't want to but I like to make sure my still top is extremely clean just because we use our stove almost three times a day because we are home schoolers and I work from home so I want to make sure that it's SuperDuper clean so I take it I take an old toothbrush that's what I do I wet it and then I scrub on the sides there you can see there's still some a little bit of the baking soda mixture on the side so this is how I make sure that I get all of that up before I put the stove back together and then I take that wet towel again and I go back through to get rid of all those little pieces that I got up when I used to do thrush and again I just wipe everything to the front because that makes life a lot easier and it comes to getting all of those items up and you could probably use the vacuum again for this but I didn't have a lot to get rid of so I just I pushed it all to the front and I pushed it to the floor because I'm going to sweep after I clean my stovetop did you forget about these pieces yeah sometimes we do uh-huh so once I get stove top finished this is when I come over and I clean the grates they've been soaking for a bit so you really should have too much to clean but just make sure they're nice and clean and all the food is off last hack for you guys is olive oil I love putting olive oil on my stovetop it just it makes it all shiny and new and looks super clean and it's olive oil so you know it's gonna burn off its food grade so you don't have to worry about it making your so tough look weird and this just it's like the icing on the cake you do not have to do this but if you love shiny bright new things use a tiny bit of olive oil on top of your sofa once you're all done you can start putting your stove back together you can wait for the pieces to dry that you washed in your sink or you could just put them right back onto the stove remember you're gonna use your stovetop so they're gonna dry eventually so you decide which one you like better but I just put everything back together very easy peasy thank you guys so much for watching that video of my clean with

        "content": "hi guys today I'm going to share my quick 10 minute stovetop cleaning routine that I do every night before I go to bed since I have a glass top stove I'll also show you how to clean your gas and electric stoves and I'll show you that as I'm going through my cleaning tips and tricks so let's go ahead and get started so as you can see I have a bowl of soapy water and I've already sprinkled my stove top with baking soda I just use any old baking soda I don't think it really matters here just sprinkle it on and whether you have a gas top or electric or glass you can sprinkle it on the parts that our contact and you have lots of grime and grease take out the electric coil if you have an electric so and then on the gas burner take off the top part the metal part and you can soak those and scrub those in the sink but here you just sprinkle the rest of the stove you don't want it to be dripping wet you just want the cloth to be damp you can see I don't have a lot of liquid there because i want the baking soda to act as an abrasive and i'm just going in a circular motion I'm just scrubbing all of the the hard spots of food the little burn marks that you get on the stove sometimes that are just kind of hard and sort of don't going in a circular motion until I find something that might be a little bit harder and and then I will scrub like that it's kind of scrubbing in that little area adding some more baking soda to get rid of it you could use a sponge that has an abrasive side but just say sure whatever type of stove you have whether it's the gas electric or glass top that it's not going to scratch and leave marks on your stove when we moved into our house we had scratches on our stove already and it was just kind of annoying that you know there was not really a lot that I can do about it actually if there if any of you have tips for me on how I can get those scratches off of the glass top I would love to hear that just comment below and I would love to get your tips and tricks on that and I would I'll take care of that as soon as possible but so if you have any tips for me please comment below let me know I need to really remember those scratches so right there you can see that the different color of the baking soda because it's picking up all that grease and so I'm just showing you that in there and you see them just continue to scrub getting rid of all that grime it doesn't take that long I you know how to add a little bit more water there it wasn't quite foam it up and see right there I kind of added a little too much water I feel like that that can be a little too much it won't get everything well the abrasiveness won't happen sorry about that but I want to make sure that I keep the abrasion there so I can get those little tough spots so here I'm just kind of rubbing you know to feel if I feel anything with my hand that still needs to come off obviously there's a few more spots there and I will go over the whole stove to make sure that I've removed everything around the burners to make sure that you know that way when I get ready to light the stove down there's nothing there because nothing worse than not knowing that stuff is there and then you go and clean your stove get all this baking soda off and then you have tons of spots that need to be spot treated so just try to do it all before I'm all finished and so I'm just going over the top part of the so making sure because right now once if there's nothing there I will be ready to go ahead and stop scrubbing and get ready to wipe everything down so I'm going to continue to check that and make sure that there's nothing there clean up at everything and looks like there's not a whole lot left which is pretty awesome and again this doesn't take that long it takes me most the time less than 10 minutes to completely get everything done I never go past 15 minutes because I feel like that's just way too much time to clean the stove and if you clean as you're cooking which i do not i am a tear in the kitchen and like the Tasmanian devil in the kitchen everything's everywhere so if you cook like me this is your night time routine for sure if your meal prepping this might be your routine but this is something I do every night sometimes it takes me five minutes depending on what I'm making this night I just happen to use all four of my burner and and so I just ever there was stuff everywhere I even had my little rolling kitchen island cart that I have some ikea it was full of stuff as well but luckily the glass top and the ikea cart are very easy to clean so all right so I'm done I think I'm done right here I'm just looking at the pile and seeing how it looks I'm rinsing out my rag so this is the first rinse that I'll deal with my rag I'm just going to rinse all of that baking soda out all the extra soap until the water pretty much runs clear again you want to make sure that the rent the water runs from the rag clear so that you're not taking all of that grind back over to the stove and that's a really important part because if you do you'll end up wiping the stove multiple times so again it's very important during this process that you are completely you know clean your bag like make sure it's absolutely clean before you go back you don't need to add any soap or do anything like that I've done that before I've added soap and it ended up being a nightmare because then i just added too much so to my rag and then put it in my soapy water bowl and just made a mess so make sure you just have a soapy water bowl and that is what you're using ok so here I've got my rag completely cleaned out I sort of fold it in half and I start wiping down my stove and getting all of that baking soda off and it looks so beautiful I mean I'm so happy at the end of the night when I have a beautiful stove it just looks so pretty it's so shiny and so at this point while I'm cleaning up all of that baking soda I wanted to let you guys know that have a gas stove an electric stove you want to make sure that you've got your little if you have electric you got those little holes cleaned out where the burners go if you've got the little metal plates underneath you scrub those those are all done they could have been soaking in hot water and you want to make sure that they're already washed and dried and ready to go back on your stove for those that have gas you want to have scrubbed your gas plates that go on top oh here sorry let me go back I'm rinsing out my rag one more time again rinsing it so that the water completely runs clear okay so sorry guys back to the gas stove so you want to make sure your gas top is clean those little metal parts are cleaned and scrubbed and then everything underneath all the little metal part around part that goes on top that's taken off and washed you've cleaned all of that part on the stove and you're ready to draw your pieces so that they go back on your show ok so again make sure you do to clear rinses of your rag no matter what type of stove that you have so that you're not taking dirty soapy water back over to your clean stove ok so this part is the final part and I'm just going to dip it in some my soapy water bowl and I just have like a teaspoon of water so in this bowl it's like a little bit larger than a cereal bowl and it's filled with warm water and then I'm just going to literally finish wiping off the rest of my stove which I had already done but with the baking soda I was spray you know spraying everywhere so I'm just going to make sure I white all of that gown getting all the cracks and crevices to make sure there's no leftover soap powder I found a spot that was still a little sticky then getting all of those so I'm getting in the cracks and crevices and you can use a toothpick here to get in your cracks and crevices I don't do that every night I do that on deep cleaning but you know if you really don't want to have that if you feel like you can't get it with your bag that's ok going to use a toothpick but again I'm just wiping up all of the baking soda because this is going to be my final rinse this is the wash and the rents i'm getting the side where I hate again sprayed all kind of baking soda everywhere and just making sure I get all of the stove nice and clean you see it's got a little bit of bubbles not a lot and now I've got my microfiber it's completely dry and I'm just using that to kind of buff out the stove and yet i'm getting the top part i'm getting all along the sides and i'm just making sure that everything is completely done so you can see after i finish you know buffing and shining everything you'll see that the stove looks so amazingly beautiful it's nice and shiny it's beautiful it is ready for me to destroy tomorrow you see that the scratches there that i was talking about earlier so if you guys know how to get rid of that if you can comment below I'd really appreciate it I will love any tips that you guys can give me to help left that out see it's so beautiful I'm ready to go to bed it's and have a peaceful night's sleep because it's just shining and ready for my next day thanks so much for watching please like share and subscribe I appreciate you and I'll see you guys ",

        "content": "if my mom has this cool thing she just found out about and I wanted to share it with you where is she let's go get her she's got something that you might be interested in hello mother this is Joe Hey you just found out something really cool about your stove I wanted you to tell me about can you show me on your stove yes something that you just wanted to share with the air conditioning guy when he came over here to tell his wife on your stove and you're making something up bubbles and boils over and then your burners get that burns on him okay just just show me what show me what you're talking about I'm talking about these things that when you try it okay no wait these look perfectly clean what's wrong with them this one isn't but this one's really clean see this one still has some stuff just when I scrubbed ours on trying to clean this up after making applesauce oh there's some right there Dover and it was all over these burners these little things I took took this off I took this off I took this off oh wow and so you scrubbed and scrubbed this it looks pretty clean but you weren't satisfied with it right well it's still got some stuff on how long how long did it take for you to make this one clean three hours three hours it took me a long time and to see some of this stuff bubbled over it bounced over on this other burner and then it burns on yeah I've seen I've seen some stoves that just have it marks all over the place so now I see you've got this one in a plastic bag what's that all about well you by ammonia I got this from Walmart cost $1 27 cents or all of this ammonia ha ha and you put okay hold on this is straight ammonia right here great value ammonia tough on stains grease and grim grime grime that's right okay so what do you do okay you take a plastic bag a ziploc bed yeah and you put 1/4 of a cup of ammonia in this bag and then you put your stove part in there feel it in the fumes see this black stuff right here yeah and I take this out of the bag that's gonna fall off it's gonna fall right off so you get that because that other burner over there that's nice and clean yep it had a lot of black on it and when I I left it overnight and when I took it out of here some of the stuff just fell off in my thing right so then you just wipe you just wiped off the rest of it well I I put it under the air and I put it under the water and I took this little scrubber thing and just kind of touched on it and I couldn't believe a clean it came so fast I want my fingers out trying to clean that other one because I made an applesauce and it just bubbled all over and then it burned on and it just sucks so hard so I looked on the internet I there has to be a better way to clean this and I looked on the internet and I found this well so this one just because I don't want to dirty up to what you're using one at a time I'm doing my brother one and now I'm doing this why he says she saves money any way she can I'll do that one okay so so this back burner cover right here not the first one there this second one wow that does look nice and clean yeah yeah hey now let's establish something right here now do you work for Walmart are you saying this because you want people to go to all art are you about that I'm just saying God cheat that cleanser stuff that ammonia yes straight ammonia that's pretty amazing because I thought I thought you're going to say you put a quarter cup of that in a plastic bag put water in it and then soak it but you're saying a quarter cup and when that stuff dries it doesn't dry or win it or just a few you should come out you can go over there and holding that bag and smell it it's wrong okay so just the fumes of the ammonia makes those those oven burners clean yeah that's amazing also it said you can put some of this in your oven yeah and close the oven door Oh leave it I guess overnight in a room you can wipe your own now okay I might try that cool um one thing you don't want to use it on aluminum okay because these are some make it'll make little holes in it well not many things are aluminum anyways I guess the cover is like an electric burner sometimes you have a cover inside yeah those are those are aluminum so you're saying don't put on that so they have to these are ceramic covered and anything that's kind of ceramic covered like gas top gas top burners and that kind of thing not quite sure about the electric burners what do you think about the electric burners because they're slightly different than this I don't know I don't know you have to look at your stove okay I was looking at this and they showed this picture just like is okay on the internet so this is a gas stove stove cleaning or something like that right and this came up and then showed these exact things right here oh and I got boy that just like mine now see this pan is aluminum because I was thinking I would put this in the oven with some of that on it but I can't because this is aluminum why what would I do it to aluminum did say well it says it makes up mixed marks on it makes little holes oh it's right through it okay well we're not saying it does that it's just what what you read right yes okay I read that so the main thing is we're talking about these burners and that's how you're gonna do it from now on you bet yeah I bet you can tell all your friends now iodine this are my sister and tell her I'm sure cleaner so very easily only thing is she very seldom cooks okay well that's all I have thanks for sharing that little tip of yours mother oh you're so welcome I hope it helps lots of people that clean stoves okay alrighty thank you you're welcome what are you doing gonna call my sister you're gonna call your sister right this very moment before you forget huh hahaha yes hey she did say that she used all types of different cleaners and just did whatever she could in three hours and I'm not going to name any of these cleaners because I don't want to get anybody in trouble all right but a dollar 27 ammonia that's the way to do it now you know kind of burners that logout in it said no ammonia yeah get some ammonia and put 1/4 of a cup in a plastic zip bag there she is still yakking away with my auntie oh goodness well that's all I have for this time but I'll be back with more videos hey whenever I see something that you might be interested in I'm gonna show it ",

        "content": "okay increase video one of the most fulfilling drugs cleaning your salsa and we're going to clean the glass stovetop enough which you should remove the grill that covers what I call the black hole the band filter and the actual black hole which is really hard to clean so I will set all this aside and unfortunately I'm gonna have to start with the most unpleasant task cleaning the black hole and there is no easy way to do it all you have to do and the only way to do it is paper towels with soapy water and keep wiping next I'm going to clean the actual stovetop and then the nut the filter in the grill cover or the grill that covers the black pool so there isn't much to record here not very much information what I'm going to do first with wet paper towel I am going to stick my arm right in there and start wiping the goo so I finished a nasty part now I'm just going to use a sponge with soap just to get rid of the debris and I could use vinegar to do this white vinegar which I absolutely love the reason I don't is because once it starts heating up once I start cooking I'm going the vinegar it's going to smell for a long term so that madness in there took me seven or eight minutes but basically just paper towels and keep wiping until all the greasy stuff it comes and now I'm going to move to the stovetop and I'm going to use the sponge first and I actually have tried really hard in the past few days should be very sloppy when I'm cooking so I can do the video usually I wipe it after every cooking to keep it up but so so take a sponge and just wipe the big pieces and then we do the same thing come just be careful not to drop is there any big pieces not to drop them in there because you already clean there next I'm gonna take baking soda just and spread it all over the cooktop again make sure you don't drop anywhere there anything in there you can put a towel on the bottom but I don't just as such like I care about to make pizzas no so make sure to cover the whole thing with baking soda and by my baking soda all while it comes pretty cheap buying it in a big bag like this I think I get it from Amazon master plan almost to this side and repeat the same thing I forgot to tell you I actually I used to just grab it and cut it and scrub it never thought of using baking soda in this one particular part for some reason I thought that the baking soda is going to scratch the glass but it doesn't and I actually saw this in the video by Lisa with Lisa's world she has a really nice channel and she has a lot of things like gardening cooking cleaning so after you're finished with the baking soda covering the stove put to cloth or old towels whatever you may have over the baking soda just off search next I'm using hot water from the sink and get it as happy as you possibly can I can't touch this one it's very hot I mean I could heat it up here but I can't I want to have another stovetop you get water and you start pouring the water very carefully over the quote make sure that it doesn't spill all over the place and make sure that you use a cloth or a towel that absorbs water quickly because there are fabrics that are not very good at absorbing all right all right this one's set up see where I need to put some more and I was like going over here when you don't want to flood your kitchen so and but don't worry about water don't worry about water dropping wagon obser because I'm sure they're pretty well protected as far as wires and electricity because you cook on its own stuff is naturally still there let me see there are pretty well saturated very well saturated so I'll need any more water and now we sit and wait so now it's about training in its later and let it sit a little bit longer and I'm just going to grab the call and just go to start scrubbing and places where you know it accumulates foot like right around the edge when you when you cook like right over here I can see it from here is that scrubbing gently and you can see that food coming out of that with all in here here I get quite a bit when you just keep doing it until you clean this site and then you move to this side so I'm about down here and I just want to show you here is that you can tell that this is stuff that I couldn't get off with the sponge so basically these are spots where I I did clean and this one was quite a bit dirtier than this one because I do use this side more and now I'm going to read this too and I'm going to use them to wipe all the baking soda pop that so so with the rinse towel here you can see the stuff I am just going to carefully wipe all the baking soda coming out this way so it doesn't go into the crevice over there and once you're done wiping the soft tab you can remove those little rubber rings here after you're done why thinking after your tempering water and all that you can remove those and wash them and then clean around them as well you know one final touch before we move to the filter the air filter in the grill quietly wet paper towel just water nothing else and then just buff it with a dry one and if you're going to clean your soft app make sure to always get when it's completely cold so it's nice involved and now going to move to the front part the filters and the grill so for this last and most fun part you could use you could use a path that is deep enough to cover at least half of the filter however I don't have a pump that big so here is what I wanna do so I'm gonna use one of my mouth and turn both burners and high this is where I bake my turkey fill it up with water all the way up we should have water from the sink so if it is a faster and then at about I would say a cup of baking soda Trish and clothes of mine equal about it and then we wait for the water to start boiling slightly so once the water starts boiling slightly and this actually is relatively clean filters and cyah it's pretty greasy though I washed it in the dishwasher once but that didn't do much didn't get rid of all of the dirt so once the water starts boiling slightly you have the filter and then you have the grill and it only covers half of the grill so at one point we're going to have to flip it over and if your naps are greasy and dirty you can just soak them in there however mine are not so I'm just going to wash them with the soapy water in the sink while this guy here is boiling you can see right over here around the edges so does the greasy and dirty stuff exciting in here we think it's starting to float up a little bit look at all the dirty stuff coming down so once the fun starts getting all the way up I'd be there near burn yourself and if you're worried that it may overflow turn them turn them off a little bit earlier but then we'll flip this guy over and just let it sit I'm going to keep the burner self because it gets really hot and I don't want it to boil over and mess up the stuff again and now you just let it sit for another ten or fifteen minutes and just let it be with the burners turned off so now it's 15 minutes later I'm going to take these guys out I'm going to take the whole thing to the scene be very careful because it is cut I'm going to take it out to the sink and rinse them off and dry them out and I'm going to show you what they look like and here when I started recording I forgot to turn my microphone on so what I'm basically saying is that you have to reinstall the rubber rings before you install the nuts then you install the knobs then you install the filter inside the crevice and then you put the grill over the crevice and you got yourself nice shiny and clean glass stovetop so this is what the stovetop looks now the filter is clean the grill is screened and after cream every engine screen took me a total of 48 minutes and down unfortunately I have to do it quite often because I put quite a lot but if you guys like this video please give us a thumbs up if this is your

        "content": "hello I'm Melissa from Northland Express and in this video I'll be talking about how to keep your wood stove clean I'll cover the four main areas of your stove that you should focus on and how frequently I love my wood stove and it works hard for me to keep my home warm and my energy cost down over the years I've learned a lot about caring for wood stoves and I'd like to share that information with you as well so that your job can be easier and you can help keep your wood stove going when you need it to the four main areas of your stove that you'll want to pay attention to are the exterior the interior the flue and the glass door I'll start first by talking about the exterior of your stove and how often you'll need to clean it and what you'll need to clean it obviously if you spill something on your wood stove you should clean it up right away just remember if you're burning with your stove at the time it will be hot so use caution with wiping it off as well as consideration when you use something to wipe it off with the exterior of your stove we'll get dusty from the ash and that's easily remedied with a damp cloth or dry microfiber cloth when the stove is cooled if you notice that your stove is looking tired or worn you can also use stove polishes to bring its look back to life if you spill water on your stove while you're filling your steamer try not to let that sit there as it could leave behind mineral deposits as the water evaporates or lead to rusting of your stove which isn't going to look very good keeping the exterior of your stove looking clean will be something that you need to do quite frequently when the stove is in use during the off season you really only need to keep it dusted another area of your exterior portion of your stove to check frequently when in use is the blower the blower is going to collect hair and dust as it runs and keeping that it clean is only going to extend the life of your stoves blower the next area of your stove that you're going to need to clean frequently is the interior of the stove you'll want to be removing the ashes as they accumulate if you're going to restock your fire make sure that you do leave some ashes in there that's going to help insulate the firebox which is going to ease your fire starting process if you're not going to be burning then you should completely remove the ashes and dispose of them safely the best way to remove ashes whether restarting or just going to empty them out completely from your wood stove is to use your tool set shovel as well as an ash bucket that's going to be metal no plastic should ever be used when it comes to removing ashes or hot coals from your wood stove I also recommend having an ash vacuum this is going to be the only safe way that you can suck up cool ashes from your firebox or your hearth area don't ever try and use your household vacuum that's a great way to set your vacuum on fire and end up buying a new one a tip that I have for you is when you're placing the ashes into the ash bucket move slowly this is going to have you avoid a plume of ash going up and into your air and all over your hearth and stove so you have to clean it again when you're cleaning out the ashes from your stove use this time also to check the fire bricks inside of your firebox for cracks any of those that are cracked should be replaced for safety purposes another area that's very important to keep clean is the flue or chimney of your wood stove if you're a frequent burner it's recommended that you're cleaning your chimney one to two times during the winter or when you're frequently using it and I know it's unsafe to get on your roof and clean your chimney for the top down in the winter because of snow on your roof but there are products like creo bakes that allow you to clean your chimney from the bottom up and catch the mess in a contained bag so you don't have a big mess on your hands cleaning your chimney is vital because dangerous courious that build up in chimneys is the number one cause of chimney fires in the United States and creosote buildup is practically unavoidable if you're burning wood but you can help keep the creosote levels down while you're burning by using products like ACS creosote remover and spraying it on your fire or using another form which is a toss in creosote remover these are going to help make those particles formless and make them easier when you do clean your chimney the final important air of your wood stove to keep clean is the glass door not only will this allow you to enjoy the beautiful dancing flames but keeping the glass clean is also going to increase the heat output of your stove did you know that just one thirty-seconds inch of soot buildup on the glass door is the equivalent insulating factor of two inches of asbestos insulation it is and that's crazy but it is really going to cut down the heat output of your stove with that much I use Rutland glass cleaner and it's a very effective and easy to use product anytime I see the glass starting to blacken I simply spray the door down let it sit for a few minutes and then wipe it off another tip I have for you when it comes to cleaning the glass door is if you have a really stubborn build-up spot or hard areas to get to grab a razor blade and use that to scrape a tough buildup off also when you're cleaning your glass door take advantage of that time and use it to inspect the gasket around in your glass on your door this is a great way to make sure that you're keeping that gasket in good working order and keeping it functional I hope you found these tips helpful but if you've got questions about cleaning your wood stove or any of the products that I've recommended please give us a call at eight six six

        "content": "hi everyone its Liliana from vanilla and Cannella here today I wanted to share with you how I've deep cleaned my cooker and oven and I'm gonna took it took you through it step by step so as you can see this oven is disgusting I have been putting this off for months this is probably the job that I hate doing the least so it just it gets a bit dirty as you can see this is the product that I'm using to do this particular job I usually buy a leading brand I can't remember the name now but it stinks it's super toxic but this one has no smell but the first thing I did and I did this the night before I intended to clean the oven was put all the different shelves into this bag and put some of the product with it shake it about seal it and leave it overnight I then put on the gloves and spread all the product all over the oven as you can guys can barely see here and again I left it overnight [Music] it's now the next day and here's what the oven looks like you can see some product spilled so the first thing I'm gonna do is put on some gloves this is super important because you don't want any of that product to get on your hands because it can irritate skin and all I'm doing is just taking a little scrubby pad with some washing-up liquid and scrubbing off any leftover this product does an excellent job so there isn't a lot of scrubbing involved and then just putting some washing-up liquid in the tub with hot water so I can clean the oven and in the meantime I'm taking the two glass bits out you'll see the other one later sprinkling with bicarbonate and some vinegar and leaving it and while that's happening I go in and scrub the oven most of it came off straight away and then I just rinse rinse rinse I mean you guys are gonna see the water it is absolutely disgusting and its really satisfying to see to see the oven looks so nice now take a look at that water that's just from the top oven I haven't even started in the bottom one so just by leaving the glass to soak for about 20 minutes not even that just with the bicarb in the vinegar then I just give it a quick scrub and it comes off everything comes off really fast I'm taking all the knobs out and I'm gonna soak them in just some washing-up liquid and water hot water obviously and just leave them so then I can just wash them later refilling the tab with some more water and washing up liquid and again doing the same thing I did to the smaller glass and now I'm gonna go and clean the bottom oven this is so bad you guys this is probably the one really embarrassing spot in my house I just just put it off and off and as you can see it looks pretty grim now the main thing to remember is to clean it and then clean it again and again and again to make sure that all the product comes out because obviously it's quite a harsh kind of chemicals that are cleaning the oven [Music] now these little bits of aluminium have just sprayed them with my washing up liquid and just left them to soak a little bit I ended up spraying also the glass just because I wanted to make sure that all the grease was completely gone but they were the easiest part to clean [Music] more hot water and just look at the grime that's where I took the knobs out to clean I make a promise right here never to let it get that bad I move the cooker and just look at the back just look at it guys look to the sides I know you guys think that I always keep a very clean and tidy house but this really is bad these are the products I used I sprayed them on the sides of the cabinet and the two walls on the tiles on the floor everything and then while that was soaking I just cleaned the top of the cooker with that astonished pace it's what works the best my cooker is very very old so some of the stuff doesn't come out anymore but it does a good job so now about everything has been soaking for a few minutes I just literally is just a wipe clean and you're done I make a promise right here right now never to let it get this bad [Music] it looks it actually looks worse than it is it didn't take that long to clean up once again I let the product do the hard work and soak it and let the grime off and then again it's just a wipe down and wipe down again and again to make sure that all the product is gone and everything's nice and clean [Music] so much better so then I pushed the cooker back into place and now I'm just giving a quick wipe to the glass with some window cleaner and here's the finished product it looks so much better it's not 100% and again it's a very old cooker but you know it's not too bad and now he's just puttin everything back the glass I'm really happy that the glass panels come out because they're easy to clean and putting the shelves back in and this is the best factor - you guys I mean it looks so so much better and I'm so glad I did this and I will definitely not get it let it get this bad for again do you guys have a spot in your house that is the same it just gets really bad let me know in the comments that's it you guys I hope you have enjoyed this videos as much as I've hated cleaning it so I'll see you guys next time bye for now ",
