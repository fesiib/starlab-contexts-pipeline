        "content": "back in the real Halloween trick-or-treat days people actually used to make and hand out these instead of this I mean when's the last time you saw that those were the good old days and I think they're pretty much gone partially because people nowadays find it quite a trick to make this traditional fall treat well I've got some good news it's not as much of a trick as you might think hang out for a few minutes because I'm gonna show you how to make this delicious caramel apple the old-fashioned way okay there are basically two ways you can go about making caramel apples number one you can go out and buy some caramels it's the easy way and add two tablespoons of water to every pound of cut caramels and just microwave it until it's smooth and thick or if you're feeling particularly nostalgic you can do number two which is to make this decadent caramel dipping sauce from scratch just like the good old days really come on it's not that difficult and I'm going to show you how plus I had a couple of special finishing touches which make my caramel apples irresistible so let's get right to it here are the ingredients a medium sized saucepan to cook your caramel sauce a candy thermometer that reads to at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit a cookie sheet lightly sprayed with vegetable spray or a silicone non-stick baking mat or wax paper a pastry brush a couple of small bowls and last but not least some sticks for your apples and here's where you can get really creative you can either use one quarter inch wooden dowel rod cut into six inch pieces and sharpened with a pencil sharpener or craft sticks otherwise known as popsicle sticks or you could just cook some cool sticks from your neighbors tree and call it a day to make approximately three cups of caramel dipping sauce or enough to coat about eight to ten medium to small apples you're gonna need one cup of granulated sugar one cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of light clear corn syrup 1/4 cup of water one and a half cups of heavy whipping cream two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract two tablespoons of salted butter and eight to ten apples your choice but I generally recommend once you prefer eating otherwise I have here some of my favorites Fuji Kiku Honey Crisp and Granny Smith but you can also find a great list of my favorite eating apples in Nino's Apple guide which you can find on our website or in our stores begin by washing drying and inserting 6-inch wooden skewers or craft or popsicle sticks or even twigs into your apples then slightly chill all of them in the refrigerator or in a cool place now avoid chilling them to the point where they sweat when you bring them out to room temperature to make the caramel sauce place the water the corn syrup and both sugars in a medium sized saucepan stir to combine the ingredients well then wash down the sides of the pan with a brush and water then place it on your burner begin cooking the caramel sauce over medium-low heat until it comes to a gentle simmer let it simmer for about five minutes then stir in the cream the vanilla and the butter return the mixture to the burner and turn up the heat to medium and place your thermometer in the pan check it every few minutes until it registers 250 degrees Fahrenheit and then remove the entire sauce from the heat you really don't have to stir it if you don't want to okay we're at two hundred and fifty degrees right now so I'm gonna take my thermometer out and obviously this is too hot to dip apples in right now so we're gonna have to cool it down the best way to do that is I've got over in my sink some cold water and I'm gonna set the pot down into the cold water and just stir it very gently until it starts getting thicker and a little cooler and then eventually I'm gonna transfer it over into a bowl that I can dip my appleson so i'ma head over to think right now I'll join you there two to three inches of cold water is enough to do the trick here just gently stir the sauce until it becomes creamy and fudge-like and that usually takes about a minute okay I've had this cooling in the cold water bath in the sink for a couple of minutes now and it's just about the consistency I want to do my caramel apples so we're gonna put this into a deeper Bowl and that'll allow me to get the Apple right down into the caramel a lot having to roll it around too much you can see how beautifully thick this caramel sauce is so we'll just get it all in there and now what I'm gonna do is bring up my apples and start dipping let's check our apples they've been now chillin for about 15-20 minutes they're just nice and cool but they're not to refrigerate it if you know what I'm talking about they're not too cold I have my sauce that we just brought off of the range put on our little water bath in there and got nice and cool and so you're just gonna make sure they're not sweating which they are not and we're gonna dip this down almost to the stem roll it around a little bit like this check that out now it takes quite a while for the caramel sauce to run completely off so what I like to do is when I start getting a nice gathering of sauce on the bottom I wipe the bottom just like this and then turn it upside down and just kind of rotate it a bit and that'll allow the caramel sauce to evenly coat the outside of the apple at that point in time we're gonna set it down and pick up another one plunge it all the way into the sauce so maybe you can still see a little bit of the Apple on top just like this and this one while it's still soft I'm going to add one of my ingredients that I love adding and that's smoked sea salt and I have some right here it's called Falk salt we sell it at Nino's so what I'll do here just wipe this off and then right around the top just the top rim only I like to put this smoked salt and it makes your Apple taste so smoky and salty around that caramel sweetness it's a little bit like us some mores in the fall just a wonderful taste get the extra caramel sauce off and go on to my next Apple now I have one more secret that I add to my caramel apples and that's chocolate I'm gonna do that a second okay here's step two of my wickedly delicious caramel apples I did one with smoked salt and I did one without we're gonna finish these both the same way and that's with chocolate now you can buy chocolate dip which we have at Nino's it's called the Dulce fruit de and you can melt this right in this cup and it works great or you can take three ounces of chocolate morsels and add one tablespoon of vegetable oil I melt that microwave oven it'll work the same way so I have right here my fruit date Dolce and I'm going to dip it about a third of the way in chocolate so I now have the smoked sea salt I have the caramel and I have the chocolate and this hardens pretty quickly as you can see and just set it down just like that and get my other one here and dip it to right about halfway up maybe and it doesn't take long to to harden at all mmm just swipe the bottom like that and we're done so whether you like smoked salt on yours and chocolate or just caramel and chocolate just plain caramel or any other types of toppings you can imagine from nuts to cookies and ground candies of all different kinds you've got to try these caramel apples out this fall they're delicious now as I mentioned there are loads of other top things you can decorate your caramel apples with just keep in mind that you want to sprinkle or or roll them onto your caramel apples just after you dip them and before the caramel sets most important have fun hey let me know how your caramel apples turned out what apples did you use what toppings did you try I'm Pete Lauren director of culinary development at Nino's if you

        "content": "caramel is a really versatile building block for dozens of different desserts making your own cromwell's a really simple process but there are a few pitfalls to watch out for one is the criminalization of the sugar which can cause the mixture to solidify and the second is either under cooking or over cooking your caramel in this video I'll show you how to make a basic caramel that's perfectly cooked as well as how to transform it into a delicious and easy caramel sauce now for my setup I have a pastry brush with some water and a 2 quart saucepan for the caramel I'm going to start with 1 cup of sugar a quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of lemon juice this is going to help prevent the caramel from crystallizing and seizing up as it cooks so the first thing I'm do is just use my pastry brush and just wipe down the sides of the pan getting any little sugar crystals that are on the side of the pan you want to wash those down ok that looks good now I'm going to place this over medium-high heat and bring it up to a boil now you don't want to stir your caramel as it cooks that can cause crystallization so you just want to occasionally swirl the pan just like this now this method is called a wet caramel because we're adding the water there's also a method called a dry caramel where you don't add any water it cooks a little bit faster but you run the risk of scorching your sugar so the water is going to help to prevent that so basically we're just letting that water cook off and then the sugar is going to start to caramelize ok so now that my mixture has come to a boil I'm going to let it continue cooking until it starts to get a little color and I'll go back in there with my wet pastry brush and just continue to wash down the sides every now and then and again you don't want to stir but you can give the pan a little swirl okay so it's just starting to change color a little bit around the edges and in a few spots so at this point you just want to give the pan a little swirl to start to even out the color and this is the time when you really want to watch your caramel because if you step away it can go from undercooked to burnt really quickly so just keep an eye on it and keep swirling the pan now you can test your caramel by playing a little drop on a white plate so I'll show you what it looks like at this point so this as you can see is really light this is going to have very little of that bittersweet caramel flavor that we're looking for just a few seconds later and it's a little bit darker this is a light caramel again we don't really use caramel at this stage it's not going to have the complexity that we're looking for the darker caramel goes the more complexity it's going to have now we have a medium amber this is what you'll use for caramel sauce or a lot of different recipes that we have on our website and watch closely and pay attention because in just a few seconds we're going to have a dark amber and here we have a dark amber now this is what you would use for creme caramel or anywhere where you want a really assertive strong caramel flavor now when you're at the point you want you want to remove your pan from the heat and you want to use your caramel right away because it hardens up rather quickly one of the easiest things to do with your batch of caramel is to make a caramel sauce so I've got a new batch that I've started and it's at the medium amber stage so at this point I'm going to pull it off the heat and add 3/4 of cup of heavy cream now you want to stand back because it will splatter a little bit and come is very hot and I'm going to put it back on the heat and you can stir it at this point with the wooden spoon and you'll notice that some of it starts to seize up but as it melts it'll get nice and smooth now to finish the caramel I'm going to add two tablespoons of butter I'm just going to add it slowly I've cut it up into small pieces and I'll add just a few at a time and then stir it in to melt beautiful once the butter is all melted the last thing to add is a teaspoon of vanilla extract mmm this smells like heaven this is perfect for drizzling over ice cream over fruit or basically in any kind of chocolate dessert ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hi I'm Anthony and I'm gonna show you how to make caramel candies and first step is just to get your ingredients ready your first ingredient is sugar one cup of white granulated sugar that's seven and a half ounces ingredient number two isn't quite so obvious it's a quarter cup of light corn syrup you're probably asking well why corn syrup let's find out this is sucrose take a table sugar it's made up of a bunch of carbons and some oxygens and some hydrogen's to fill the clutch and as you probably already know sucrose has a tendency to form crystals and you can heat those crystals up or dissolve them in water and it becomes a liquid but as soon as it dries out or cools down it's gonna become a crystal again if you're making candy with sugar sucrose then that's going to lead to a sort of grainy sandy texture in your candy you don't want that especially in caramels so one method to prevent the crystallization of sucrose once it's in a liquid form is to introduce some sort of acid like lemon juice or cream of tartar and what that does is split sucrose down the middle into glucose and fructose which won't crystallize unfortunately since acids tastes a little sour you can bite into a lemon if you want to test that your candies not going to be as sweet and you probably want your candy to be sweet so another solution to prevent sucrose from crystallizing is to introduce something else that prevents the sucrose molecules from touching each other and actually forming crystals sort of like creating a barrier around the molecules so that they don't form crystals of one another and that's where the corn syrup comes in and I'll demonstrate one suppose these three-dimensional blogs are sucrose molecules when you push them together in one space they have this tendency to form a crystal a sugar crystal but if you tear them apart by melting them with heat or dissolving them and add something like I could say one syrup then pushing them together or the corn syrup interferes with these molecules ability to recrystallize and so you don't get this grainy texture as if you were biting into a sugar cube you get a smoother texture as if this were still a liquid and that's what you want for a caramel and the nice thing about corn syrup is that it's mostly glucose anyway so it'll add sweetness to your candy and also be completely flavorless next ingredient is four tablespoons of butter that's half a stick and the fat will serve a similar purpose as the corn syrup the salt will accent the sweetness and this is salted butter so that's alright but if you're using unsalted butter you're gonna want to add about 1/4 teaspoon of this stuff and your last big ingredient is going to be 1 cup of heavy cream again that's more fat to prevent recrystallization of the sugar plus the proteins in the cream will react with the sugar and create that dark brown caramel color that is characteristic of caramel plus it's pretty tasty vanilla extract is an optional ingredient but it adds a nice booger start off with a glass pan about two quarts be the size you want and line it with either parchment paper wax paper or aluminum foil any of those will work but if you use aluminum foil you're probably gonna want to grease the aluminum foil once it's in the pan and just to guarantee that your candy won't stick to it sometimes I have problems with aluminum foil sometimes I don't so with ingredients on hand grab yourself a fairly large size cooking pot and then start tossing in your ingredients but the only thing I'd hold off on is the vanilla because if you cook it too long then you'll cook the flavor away and then then what's it even adding it at that point [Music] so remember save with vanilla to the end and in the corn syrup turn the heat on to about medium so it looks like my butter is about melting so now I'm going to add this to the pot this is a candy thermometer and it's absolutely vital for this process and I'll tell you why so you may or may not have realized it but the cream and butter that you have any mixture have moisture to them they have water in them and water changes it stayed at 212 degrees it becomes steam it evaporates so liquid water itself will not get above 212 degrees because it turns of something else at that one but your candy in the mixture is actually gonna want to get much hotter the sugar will get way hotter than 212 but the water in it because it has us 212 tap is actually going to cool down the whole mixture so as water evaporates the less water you have the less cooling you have and the less cooling you have the hotter your candy can actually get and it turns out when your candy is about 250 degrees maybe a little bit lower than that then enough water has evaporated and create the perfect proportion between water and sugar to where if you pour it out and let it cool you can cut it up and it'll be they'll be solid pieces that you can hold in your hand but they'll still melt in your mouth so I've got my candy thermometer in and you want to make sure this little nub the point that actually reads the temperature is not touching the bottom of the pen otherwise you're going to get a reading on the pan and not the liquid that's inside the pan and it's not such a problem with this model cause it had this little foot on the bottom which is just something they love and this just clips to the side here so something to note is that once it gets to this boiling stage of mixing it too much will help those sucrose molecules find each other and reform crystals so you want to minimize your mixing but you still want to stir it a little bit just so that your things are even and so the thermometer will get a reading on the average temperature not just the temperature at the side of the pan so check this up now I'm about 20 minutes into the cooking process and it's almost almost done it's almost reached 250 this is way thicker it's got that dark amber color from the proteins and the in the cream reacting with the sugar so it's looking a lot more like caramel and it's smelling a lot more like you ought to so this is all good sign that things are going according to plan so far just a few more minutes pour this into the prepared pan I'm gonna do it pretty quickly that stuff hardens quite fast in the meantime you'll remember the pan we cooked in is now coated with hardened caramel and that's gonna be a pain to scrub but this is just sugar and fat and it'll melt with heat so if you fill this thing up with water put it back on the stove heat the water up to boiling for a little bit it'll practically clean itself this caramel now is about halfway cool I can tell because it's still soft in the middle but when I lift it up it holds its shape so I'm going to pull it out of this pan use this time to do a little bit of cutting and shaping of course you can cut this just straight I'm gonna cut it at an angle though that way I can make some nice diamond shaped Jesus all right nice for a bit foot brush equals glucose fructose sucrose forms crystal but you normally don't want in your cannon because it forms a gritty sandy sort of texture and can prevent that with corn syrup corn syrup plus sucrose will prevent the sucrose from actually forming Chris but once the sucrose is in its liquid form 250 degrees is known as the firm ball stage it's perfect for carmella represents the perfect combination between water and sugar very much higher than that and you get a really hard candy very much lower than that and I think their soft caramel sauce I'd never partners protein or sugar over a heat source causes a chemical reaction which gives us the caramel color and new concept candy equals delicious so if you have any tips you know any tricks have any questions leave a comment let me know otherwise happy cooking ",

        "content": "if you went the perfect Halloween treat there is nothing like a caramel apple these caramel apples aren't just a regular caramel apple they first your dipped in the perfect consistency of caramel with that great amber color with that sweet and bitter flavor then once they're a little bit cooled they are drizzled with chocolate and of course have a few extra toppings with some toasted pecans and candy toffee pieces these are over-the-top and a perfect not at all spooky tree make these perfect caramel apples all coming up on today's wipeout I know you can't really hand out homemade treats when trick-or-treaters come a knocking on your door but if you happen to know the people or you have nieces and a nephew like I do or just family and friends or if you're having a party caramel apples are a great thing to have I don't know why but there is just something that seems so festive for Halloween about a caramel apple I'm gonna admit I don't necessarily go over-the-top for Halloween I have a few simple decorations I mostly love fall but I do collect the vintage jack-o'-lantern Halloween decorations because well you know everything vintage but I love to do anything festive and so to make a special treat for the holiday is always on my mind caramel apples can sometimes be a little tricky it sounds easy you just make a caramel you dip it but when I was making these for you guys I realized to get the perfect caramel it's not that easy you don't want one too thin so it just all comes off and if it's too thick it doesn't really dip in easily and you kind of have to spread it and that's not fun either so you want the perfect consistency caramel and this is exactly what you're gonna get to start you just want to take a four quart kettle and put in some sugar and a little bit of water set that on the stove over medium heat to slowly let it come up to a boil while that's happening you can get ready everything that's going to go on these caramel apples first obviously the apples I like to pick kind of medium to smaller apples because you're adding so much to them and they can be kind of awkward to eat so you want to pick a smaller Apple to begin with because those jumbo size apples which by the way kind of freak me out in the grocery store they're seriously like Frankenstein so start with a smaller Apple and if you know me you know I always pick a Honey Crisp you just want to put a handle in these apples I like to use kind of a sturdy stick I get these at cake decorating stores they're actually used to kind of lift cakes up if you need to and support them but if you cut them in half they're a perfect stick for these otherwise you could just use a popsicle stick just stick them right in the center until it feels like it has a good hold in there and then set them aside for the toppings I'm gonna use some toasted pecans because who doesn't love a toasted pecan okay I know some of you a throw like I don't you can totally leave them out if you don't want to all this is customizable just chop them up into small pieces and then set them aside [Music] I'm also using some candy coated toffee bits you can find these and they're ready to go section in the baking aisle they're just in a bag it is so simple and then I'm gonna also melt some dark chocolate just to put on top too and just kind of drizzle it over them I choose dark chocolate because the caramel is so sweet that it kind of has a nice bitterness against it and really balances it out while your water and sugar is boiling you want to just swirl the pan you don't want to stir it too much or that could really cost some crystallization once all that sugar is dissolved and the water starts evaporating off you're gonna start getting a little bit of color first it'll be very faint just a light light light brown color keep swirling the pan and eventually you're gonna notice a darker amber color I like to take mine fairly dark definitely over 300 degrees I've got about 310 degrees you do not have to temperature this if you don't want to I just like to know where I'm at take it to whatever color you like for me it's always gonna be a little darker once it's at the right color just pull that off the heat you don't want to add your cream while it's on beat slowly add in your room temperature cream if you add in really cold cream that's gonna really sputter and could almost boil over so just slowly add a few tablespoons at a time and stir it in until it's really combined once all your cream is in it should be a really smooth mixture if it's not don't fret just put it over a very low heat your burner is probably still gonna be hot enough without it even on and just keep stirring it until it's smooth [Music] once it's smooth you can just remove it from the heat completely and add in some salt because you know I need some of that salt with all this sweet caramel and then a little bit of vanilla the vanilla just really amps up the flavor and I always love vanilla stir that in and then let it cool once it's cooled for about five or ten minutes I would just pour it into a glass measuring cup this is gonna help it cool down quicker you want this to be almost fully at room temperature so I like to set mine in the fridge for about 30 minutes stirring every 10 minutes and seeing how quickly it's gonna solidify when it's at the right consistency you can start dipping your apples dipping the apples is the fun part just take your measuring cup put an apple over the top dip it in if it's solidified a little bit too much you could heat it in the microwave slightly to thin it down or just take a spatula and spoon it over slowly let it fall down that's gonna give it a smooth coating and then just set it right on top of a parchment lined baking sheet and I like to make sure that baking sheet was in the freezer for about 20 minutes before I do this that's just gonna make sure once you set it on that baking sheet that that caramel is gonna set right away you're still gonna get some that drips off and pools on the bottom no problem that's normal that will give you a smooth finish still when all your apples are dipped you can just finish with the chocolate melt your chocolate in the microwave about thirty to forty second increments stirring between until it's completely smooth I just like to use these melting chips they're really quick just drizzle on the chocolate on top of that caramel and then put them on a clean piece of parchment on top of a baking sheet this way you're not gonna put them back into all that pooled caramel on the other sheet and when you're putting on your nuts and your toffee I like to finish by dipping them back in the nuts to make sure there is a good base for them to sit on that way they are not just gonna get stuck to the parchment like when they were dripping off they're gonna have a really great base layer on them and so there will come right off it's almost like a nonstick layer it's the perfect thing [Music] after you get all of your toppings whatever customized toppings that you want to put on it just set them on the baking sheet and they are ready to go at this point you can put them in the fridge for up to about one day or you could just eat them right away I like to put them in the fridge for a little bit just to make sure they really hardened up that chocolates hard the caramel set but then just enjoy them we're gonna be honest they can be kind of hard to bite out of so don't feel bad if you get a knife out and just cut them up because they're a little bit more enjoyable this is the perfect Halloween treat and even if it's not Halloween you can enjoy these all fall along I love to make these for my family members my nieces and my nephew and just see the joy on their faces and really see the joy on my face if you agree make sure to like share subscribe for the recipe go to the description box until next time have a happy Halloween [Music]

        "content": "I have already washed and scrubbed these apples and I'm going to use skewers here as my sticks you can use chopsticks if you want you can use popsicle sticks really whatever kind of stick will go into the center of an apple and just try and get it down through the center of said apples like that and then I have some boiling water here that I have used to test my candy thermometer because I'm going to be making the caramel from scratch and to help the caramel sit or set or stick stick on the apples you want to dip your apples in this boiling water for maybe 5 10 seconds or so and this removes all the wax that is on the apples just go ahead and dip them in there for 5 seconds or so and then dry them off and that gets all the wax off like that now that the apples are dipped and are off to the side I've got some wax paper here on my cutting board if you have parchment paper you can use that whatever you use you want to liberally butter with a lot of butter if you think you have enough butter on there put some more and this will prevent the caramel from sticking to this and you just want to make sure that this is liberally coated with butter all right now let's get working on the caramel for the caramel I'm going to add my brown sugar into a heavy-bottomed saucepan you want the heaviest pan you can possibly find that you have available to you I'm going to add in my corn syrup and I'm just doing a half a recipe here for demonstration purposes I will put the full recipe down below process is the same corn syrup in there and my butter and finally my sweetened condensed milk and I'm just going to bring this up to a boil over medium-high heat and once your butter is melted all the way go ahead and put in a candy thermometer and make sure that the bottom of the candy thermometer does not touch the pan that will give you a false reading and I'm going to turn the heat down to just above medium here and be sure to keep stirring this you do not want this to burn and every once in a while scrape down the side that's why I'm starting this with a silicon spatula scraping down the sides will prevent your caramel from becoming grainy so I'm going to bring this up to a boil and I'll be back this is nearly at a boil and I'm continuing to stir this and scraping down the sides moving the thermometer out of the way so I can get back behind there and underneath it and you want to bring this up to the recipe says 248 degrees I find that to be a little hard for caramel apples so I'm going to bring it up to 245 degrees and just keep stirring this even walking away for five seconds is enough for it to burn so you definitely do not want to burn it so I'm going to keep on cooking this until we are at 245 degrees looks like right now we're just approaching 210 so we got a little bit ways to go all right this right here is right about 245 degrees so that's what it looks like when it's done again just keep stirring because you do not want this to burn I'm going to take this off heat and over here I'm going to let this sit for just a few minutes before I add my vanilla now I'm going to add my vanilla like that throw this in and now it is time to dip our apples now you want to get your apples dipped before this has a chance to cool too much so I'm just going to roll the Apple in like that let most of that caramel come off like that and I'm going to roll these in crushed peanuts chopped peanuts if you don't want to do peanuts you don't have to I just kind of like the way they look so and taste so I'm going to dip them like that and set this off on your buttered wax paper now let me get the rest of them finished and for the rest of the caramel that you don't use for dipping your apples sorry about pumpkin bumping you there I just sprayed some nonstick spray there on this granite slab and I'm just going to pour this caramel right out like that and just let this cool slice it up wrap it in wax paper if you so choose and there's some thermal candy for you so that's how you make caramel from scratch and candy apples caramel apples sorry hope you enjoy thanks for watching ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "No welcome to a marcus chocolates how-to video we're at today I'm going to show you how to make the best caramel apples using our caramel that we make from scratch some of these two pound tubs it's so easy to do five minutes in the microwave you're ready to make your own caramel apples I'll show you I'm good okay first thing you have to do is prepare you want to get everything ready for you because after you dip the Apple in the caramel the caramel is gonna set up fairly quick so you want to make sure everything you have to make those caramel apples is ready for it so you start with the Apple now apples just make sure you that you get a hard Nate Lee hard apple something like a Macintosh is better for pie it's a softer Apple Jonathan is what I'm using today it's harvested in the fall from Michigan or Midwest you can do something like a granny smith you use a Red Delicious you could use a Honey Crisp different apples for different flavors is great so you have your sticks to what it sticks yeah put them in we use though we always stick them in the bottom of the Apple it has a bigger core in the bottom of the apples that's what we do to stick them in so you can put the sticks in there now the car runner you never your toppings or any whatever your gonna be dip them in you can have whatever your gonna lay them on if it's a plain apple you want to have a tray when I have some butter spray so that you have it spread because you don't want the caramel to stick on it if you're gonna be dipping into nuts or sprinkles or some other pecans or anything else you want to dip it in so what I've trained don't necessarily need to spray it you could also put it into directly into cups everything's ready for you to go then you start your apples Mortgage chocolates to make two different types of caramel videos for a home candy making we have the caramel that we're going to use today to make caramel apples and we have more of a setup called a sped-up karma now that that's exactly the same ingredients the difference is when we're heating them up we leave some of the moisture in the caramel that's used for caramel apples because we are gonna microwave the caramel and we want to make sure that it doesn't come out too tough if we're going to take this carnal that we've we've boiled out more of the moisture so it's stand-up caramel it would be really hard when you bit into that caramel apple of you know what that so this is ready to cut to do fondues to put my cookies to do other things depending on how you like it this caramel which are being used today is ready to microwave which we're gonna do right now okay promise ready five minutes in the microwave it's very hot it's two hundred two hundred and thirty two for two hundred almost two hundred forty degrees very hot I'll show you the consistency of it take it microwave you can see that got my apples right and I will have prepared to dip them see the kernel it's just it's not like water but it's runny but it's not like water is running a caramel never stays the same way every little constantly as it cools down it was slowly thickened so you will get more apples dipped when it's this hot if you let it cool if you want a thicker consistency and the caramel apples and let it cool a little bit do not lick the spoon remember it's very hot okay so you have a bowl because when we dip it somewhere to put the excess caramel I spray it with a little some kind of a butter spray so you could easily take the caramel out after that you can reuse it and I will just eat it caramel apples are ready so we have different toppings I've put some peanuts you can do pecans walnuts whatever toppings you want have them ready maybe you want to mix walnuts of cranberries that's an apple that we make maybe you want to dip cranberries pecans and a little chocolate chunky I mean whatever it is just have it ready for you I have some sprinkles from Halloween you can do any color sprinkles you could dip whatever you think tastes good so to dip the caramel apples did you dip them in the caramel okay roll it round now this is where you want to have a bowl you don't have to spray it all over your walls so see how it use it sprays it now here's here's a technique do not use your wrist a lot of people do this use your fingertips we just want to move your fingertips to get the extra caramel off now you want to roll it almost immediately you do not want to sit on the side and let it cool casaba step so you're just gonna roll it like this okay do the bottom I like to do the bottom because I like my tapping all over it and then if you do put it in a cup it won't stick to the bottom of the cup because you could put it right in the cups you could also dip it and remember you're gonna use your fingers not your wrist when this when this cools down you just scrape it out like I said we eat it and then you put the nuts okay bottom of it and do you do this you can leave without the cup and later on I'm going to show you how we put some chocolate on that too you could also do a plain now put anything at our caramel is great it has great stand-up ability won't drip this bowl is he even getting hat on my fingertips there so you make sure that you have sprayed this with some butter spray especially with the plane because you want to be able to know don't want it to stick to any any kind of anything you put it on spray it you can use parchment paper you can use some kind of and I wanted to use something from my kitchen so to show you again fingertips now if you go like this or something like that and I mean you can wish you can knock off that's the reason you want to roll it okay just roll it like that alright so there's your caramel apples this for this size Apple to get about 12 to 15 apples out of it I already did four if you use a bigger Apple obviously less you're gonna it out of it if the caramel starts to cool down you're going to get less other to be thicker on the apples also what's fun about this caramel too if you want so you could add extra water to it and you can pour it on ice cream so there's other things you can do with it even though today we're talking about caramel apples okay so these are chocolate home candy making chocolate doesn't need to be tempered it is just heated up and you can use it on caramel apples so I'm going to put this in the microwave which is how I like to do some people like to do a double I just like to use the microwave you will have to experiment how long you're going to keep it in your microwave I always like to do it on high for short spurts and stop it and stir it in between so right now that a small amount here I have perhaps a quarter of a pound I'm just sticking my microwave for 30 seconds on high and I'll show you how it comes out okay so this is 30 seconds remember it's hot you see how it's starting to melt but it is very important to stir it in between I'm gonna heat it up again but because the nature of the microwave the Rays could burn sections of it so I'm just gonna stir it I'm gonna put it in again so this cuz it's a small amount I'm gonna put do short spurts so it doesn't burn so I'm gonna put it again in for another 30 seconds okay so another 30 seconds and you see how I'm stirring it and it is melting so it doesn't have to be completely melted it's gonna be good you even though it is not tempering chocolate and tempering means that a professional-grade chocolate like we make our panic for in our store you have to be very concerned about how to treat the chocolate bringing it up to a high temperature bring it down to low temperature adding it what's called seed it's a professional technique for making chocolate because of all the molecules in chocolate this is an oil base it does not require that kind of care but they were even with oil base there's a difference in the quality the tempering chocolate is a cocoa butter base it's higher grade so it's kind of like butter margarine this is the margarine of it it's a lot easier to use it is not professional crepe okay see how that melted it was two times for 30 seconds about a quarter pound okay you wanna do want to let it cool down a little even though it doesn't have to be coming to a certain temperature it could it still could get a little dull if it's too hot so imma let it cool down a little bit and then I'm going to I'm gonna show you two techniques okay as far as decorating goes I'm going to show you a couple of different things you could go to Pinterest to get ideas it's endless I'm going to show you how to do some stripes some very specific stripes or if you want to do some designs being very precise this is a parchment paper it's writing to some sweet firm Dunlap post you roll this this diagram will be on our website for you to see and you could pretty much take any paper this is nice for this size you want to roll it to the points equal each each other here and the reason you do that is that it closes off this hole at the end so that when you fill it up with chocolate it doesn't leak if you don't have that exactly together you can have a little opening so you just have to be careful it's not horrible it just makes this easier put a little tape on it and this way too you can control how wide you want that opening to be maybe you want thick lines on your caramel apples well then you cut it further if you're not really thin or you want to do a little design like pumpkin face you could do a little cut on it so I'm gonna leave this on the size because I'm gonna show you first of all it's cooling so if you want to dip an apple completely into a chocolate you just do the same thing remember the technique of using your fingers and so your wrist so you go like this and if you want to cover it completely remember the fingers you can put it right in this bowl because it Isabel and you get all the extra the reason you want to get the extra off is it will then form what's called it's like feet I like a nice finished look how nice that is right over here that's because I I use my fingertips get the extra caramel mop and if you were to just I'll show you what happens see that's kinda nice a there's a little bit of what's called feet but let's say I put this you could even put the nuts in there right if you want to put some nuts now what if I didn't I didn't use my fingertips to get the extra chocolate well then you're gonna have a lot of extra chocolate and it's gonna come down it's just it's not a big issue that's what we call in the industry feet so then the other thing for the writing tube you take the chocolate you put it in this tube and then actually you know scrape it out and pour it in like that thing of toothpaste so to speak cuz you want to push it up see how it's very little opening because I had the ends meet so now we take a pair of scissors now make sure when you cut it off you don't get this little piece of paper and anything so just put it on the side somewhere so you eat it it's not gonna hurt you look okay so see how I can do this if it gets clogged you just they're actually like a little nut got in there I can feel it cuz I did the knock so you don't probably undo the knots afterwards okay so that's a thin line but I think I want a little bit of a thicker line so I'm gonna cut a little bit more off okay I'm gonna put these little so see how thick that is so and then I could take and I can do this thick lines I'm a caramel apples now you don't have to use this for that this is more for if you wanted to put someone's name on it like okay let's say you're gonna give this to a friend whoo just put his name right on there so it allows you to do that or a face but you could put the thick lines on it too like that or you could just use a fork spatula this is good if you want to do very specific things on it kind of shows up better on one of these like that give those to your teachers or bus driver okay so now we have our caramel apples and this is cool down a little bit but remember this is all good stuff see it just kind of comes out and after working I shouldn't say this is works kind of plate it's cooled down enough so that you could eat it mmm can also roll it in not gonna eat that but make some caramel apples it's a really fun ",

        "content": "alright said my said it'll start popping up down here anybody joins us usually hello not just our saying hello knees a fix mirror hey guys how are you doing it's been a while since I've been on here hey there how you doing now recognize that name from before out members my name is Sarah we are in the kitchen on this beautiful on my phone I'm trying to get my camera set up so you guys can see what's going on my name is sarah and this is my so sweet kitchen this is my niece Reagan and she's joining me today she's the one to learn how to make caramels and I made a lot of them less winter like probably had a thousand camels so I've kind of got it down pat now and so to me during the fall when I think a fall I think of apple picking and all things apple and I love love love to make baked with apples and I came across this recipe for an apple cider caramel so i'm going to show you in just a second what I'm doing I'm first of all I thank you for joining the broadcast today know it's a sunday afternoon and probably always being lazy but if you're joining on the replay thank you very much feel free to share the broadcast by swiping up or down and click share you can share it on facebook now so i'm going to show you real quickly how to make apple cider caramel's a lot of people are scared of making candy i knew that i was to begin with um oh the first time i make caramels i think my heart was just like pounds like I don't want to burn them this this particular apple cider caramel recipe is pretty simple because you don't have to melt sugar to begin with what you do is you take four cups of apple cider and you reduce it on the stove so make sure what that looks like this began is four cups of apple cider and I have now reduced it down to i'm looking for a half cup measure of course you just eyeball that it's not quite half cup i'ma turn it back up since you guys are on here but it reduces down from the four cups of liquid into this wonderful flavor pack syrup and we're getting very oh there goes my thermometer so we're getting very close it i will tell you about my thermometer as well this is a fantastic electronic thermometer that i found on amazon and love it because it's pretty hard if you're using this correctly for you to make a mistake if you pay attention to what you're doing I just realize that my temperature is not where it should be anymore so what you do is you set your thermometer to the desired temperature and then when it's within two degrees of where you want to be it starts the beep and then when it hits a temperature you want to remove your candy from the stove one it beeps very quickly okay so now my apple cider caramel is is getting closer and closer to probably pretty close to the half cup mark so just imagine all that flavor and goodness in your apple cider is from four cups is now in a half a cup so it's just it's it's amazing when these caramels are make I promise you if you make them your friends will love you okay so once it gets down to that one half cup measure i have already pre-measured one-third cup of heavy whipping cream and i added eight tablespoons of butter real butter unsalted butter and melted this in the microwave ahead of time so that it's a warm temperature and what I'm going to do where you want you come and hold this so that they can see just okay now what you want to do right there that's good would you could you come to the side if you want to look to see what you want to do when you add the cream it usually is when a bubble up and spatter and it can be a quite an eruptive process so just be very careful because it will burn you badly if you get this on your hand it is that hot okay so I'm going to add the cream butter and I have one cup of white sugar and one half cup of brown sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and start to add this now all right this isn't quite as erupted as a regular can when I say regular and we're talking about my vanilla bean caramels there we go get into this a little bit closer bring the camera in tilt it down right over ok and I'm going to add the sugar this is one half cup of brown sugar there we go and one cup of white sugar so now what we're going to do is I'm gonna break this up and stir it and I'm going to keep an eye on my thermometer until it reaches 252 degrees that is the magic number can we stir this up here has anybody that's watching ever made caramels before talk to me I like when people talk to me and you can also tell me where you're from I would love to hear where you guys are do you have a place to go and pick apples during the fall everybody's quiet that's okay all right now you can see it's just like a nice gooey mess right now then we'll make sure my temperature sit probably about a medium high Oh smells so good if you could only smell how wonderful it is all right make sure all my brown sugar is mushed up now this is going to start to come back to a boil will be a rolling boil it gets pretty crazy in this pot all right now i'll let it just sit there for a minute now when i do my other periscope I'll do that later on the what happened bebeh right there um it is a little bit different approach but I will definitely go of that another time i'm going to show you wow that is coming up to temperature it's at 200 degrees right now we want to get it to 252 and it's very hot that way okay i have an eight-by-eight hand that i have lined with parchment paper parchment paper is one of my best friends and I use it all the time on a big now I have it very evenly put inside the pan in the purpose of this is is that once the caramels have hardened you want to remove them from the pan to cut them this is it's so much easier and cleanup is basically I don't you don't even have to clean the pan I just will make one batch after the other so I already have my pan prepared alright and we're up to 210 degrees also have a scant teaspoon of sea salt I like the fleur de sel sea salt and I when we're done this will go inside of the caramel and then when this caramel starts to harden I will sprinkle some on top of the camera and then because it is apple cider we also have a half teaspoon of cinnamon and I'm using Vietnamese cinnamon that i got from King Arthur Flour I love King Arthur Flour I get a lot of my baking products from them and I just can't say enough about them they're awesome okay I'm gonna go ahead and let you see with the mixture looks like now you can see how bubbly it is you see that there you go and we're at two hundred and thirty-six degrees once the temperature starts to increase it goes pretty quickly so it is very very very very very very very important that you are not being distracted when you get to this point so you are already at 242 we'll put this up because if you go past the point you're past the point of returning your camels are going to be hard rock so once i get to that 252 i'm going to remove them from the heat i'm going to add the salt and then the cinnamon important to the pan and then all we have to do is wait for them to harder which is very hard to do because they're all right we're at 248 see you hear the hear the buzzer just let me know i'm getting very close to my 250 or you can go ahead and hold the camera you want to 250 10 this is the nerve-racking part 2 52 I don't forget to turn your temperature off on the stove and a cinnamon and salt and please please remove your thermostat another service that thermometer one time I did not remove mine and when I went to pour the caramels I burnt myself with 250 degree boiling karrimor it was awful awful awful luckily had my lavender essential oil that I had not had for too long I did a little research on the internet and I put a few drops of lavender neat right out of the bottle 12 my finger and I was amazed it never hurt and it just did absolute trick okay hold it up a little bit higher look down into the bowl you can see how yummy it is and you want to quickly pour this into your pan you're prepared pan we really that the what took the longest was I reduced the decider of course before i started the broadcast so that took a little while but it knows maybe 20 minutes it really depends on how high you're boiling the the apple cider i'm not going to lie like to leave a little in the pan so i can taste it later and the nice glossy Sheen to it let's see if you can see that if you can see see how shiny it is this is it guys that's that's caramel so you're going to let them sit here i do not have the time obviously wait for them to completely cool when probably about 20 minutes or when you see they're starting to harden i like to sprinkle the sea salt on top of them if you're in a hurry you want to expedite the process just pop them in the refrigerator and if your home is very warm you might want to refrigerate them they will keep for up to a month in the refrigerator but believe me they will not last a month at your house and then the you might would take it off that thank you is so hot you can keep it at room temperature for two weeks so I have little wrapping papers that are ordered and I cut them and just like about a 1 inch square individually wrap them they are amazing gifts people love them teachers gifts actually sold them last year and they're fun and they're yummy so you can have a wonderful little taste to fall and every bite so thanks for joining and I'll catch you guys later bye ",

        "content": "welcome to Rhonda here with foods 101 today I'm showing you how to make caramel coated apples absolutely the perfect caramel covered apple you'll ever bite into the apples I'm using today is two granny smith apples these are just about medium sized as you can see as I hold it there in my hand you're going to need seven ounces of condensed milk this is a sweetened condensed milk that mean ounces is about 1/4 of a cup and 1 tablespoon you're going to need one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup of light corn syrup 1 stick of butter 1 cup of packed brown sugar and 1 cup of chopped peanuts these are dry roasted peanuts if you want to use pecans or walnuts or almonds you may do that too and of course I'm going to need skewers for my apples let me show you how we're going to start preparing the apples but first I'm going to show you how to butter up and I just use a half of a stick of butter the paper still on and I'm just going to run it back and forth until it's really well buttered and I'm using a parchment paper just to make sure these caramel apples are not going to stick now with your granny smith apples you want to make sure you clean it really well under fresh cool running water you're going to Pat them super super dry remove the stems disregard the stems and again this one has one two here in the top where we removed our stems we're taking our skewers now if you want to use popsicle sticks or if you want to use a bamboo sticks you may do that too but we're just going to add it right here down into the center and you want to do this before you clean your apples because you don't want water seeping down into your apples once you put your skewers in now over here on the stovetop I'm going to show you how to make the caramel in a four quart heavy bottom as you can see it's a very heavy pan we're going to add our stick of butter to the butter we're going to add the brown sugar the Cairo syrup and I use a spatula to make sure I get all out and then you're going to add your half a can of that sweet and condensed milk I love using a wooden spoon to stir this around and I've got my saucepan over medium-high heat and we're going to stir this until our candy thermometer very important to use one reaches two hundred and forty-five degrees I think the magic number is 245 246 247 it makes the perfect caramel for these apples and it'll stick really well to the apples my caramel is boiling now I'm going to turn down my heat to medium and I'm going to constantly stir this make sure you scrape down the sides because you don't want little sugar crystals throughout your caramel so make sure you keep that scrape down now's the time to add the candy thermometer make sure your candy thermometer doesn't hit the bottom of the pan it's got this little hook on it to fit right here on the top of your cooking pan my candy thermometer is at about two hundred and forty six degrees I'm going to lay this off to the side and then I'm going to make sure I get the size of the pan scrape down and I'm going to take this off the heat just took only about five six minutes about two minutes off the heat we're going to add our teaspoon of vanilla and you're going to stir this thing quickly okay you will incorporate this for the next two minutes before we start dipping our apples in it oh my goodness of snows yummy here we go we're just going to twirl the apples like this oh my goodness it's gonna be yummy and then I'm gonna let the excess caramel drip off as you can see there I'm just going to let it drip off and you want to work fairly quickly with this before your caramel starts setting up and I'm just going to scrape off the excess here on the bottom we're going to come in with our nuts and we're just going to tap it tap it tap it tap it tap it tap it get it on the bottom oh my arms now you can dip your caramel apples into anything you want you can dip it into M&amp;Ms crushed candy bars you can coat it with chocolate that I just love the nuts and look how beautiful that caramel apple is sit it over here where we buttered the parchment paper and got to start with the next one for the leftover caramel I'm adding the rest of those chopped nuts in here again if you want to add pecans or almonds be my guest I've added another sheet of buttered wax paper and we're just going to lie it out even out the caramel until I get it uniform size we're going to let these sit for the next two hours whoo looky there mm-hmm got a cut into this caramel apple all right here we go perfect caramel look at how that just holds on there oh yeah I'm still yummy gooey mm-hmm look at the beauty my knife stuck on the caramel there looky there how beautiful oh my goodness and it smells so yummy perfect caramel y'all nothing like homemade mm-hmm oh yeah beautiful got it give it a try mMmmm you've got that sweet delicious fresh caramel mmm a little bit of salt mmm from the nuts on the caramel and you got this tart F on the

next time bet you're wondering what I did with that leftover caramel I just used a chef's knife I'm cutting into it and cutting it into squares and wrapping it in parchment paper as you can see I took a caramel just fold it over fold it in up and then come over to the other side fold it in fold it in up and then you've got a piece of caramel you can give as a gift keep for yourself and enjoy whenever you want a piece a homemade caramel with nuts here they are all rest up and see how usually you can unwrap them and just have a piece of caramel ",

        "content": "[Music] I'm Michelle and welcome to the Kraft kitchens if you like caramel apples during Halloween I have two great treats for your little ghosts and goblins ultimate caramel apples and caramel apple nachos so to start let's make the caramel apples so I have 5 really nice-looking apples here and I'm going to add to the center wooden pop sticks so just remove the stem and insert the Pops stick inside just push it right down now the trick to remember is that you have to really wash your apples really well you want to remove any wax that might be left on the Apple and then you want to make sure that they're really dry because caramel won't stick to a wet apple melting craft caramels is really easy so I'm going to give you a couple of quick tricks first to open a caramels squeeze them pinch them really hard in the center and then the wrapping will open right up the other option you can do is you can put them on a tray pop them in the freezer for about 15 minutes and the wrapping will come off the other one is get your kids to do it so now what you're going to do is take the 1 package and put it into a microwavable bowl and I'm going to add to it 2 tablespoons of water it'll pop this in the microwave and cook it on high power for 3 minutes I'll take it out after one and a half minutes stir it put it back in finish the time and then when I take it back out I'll stir it again to make sure the caramels are completely melted you can also do this on top of the stove in a saucepan over low heat and make sure you continuously stir to make sure the caramels are melting perfectly now for the fun part dipping the apples so I have my melted caramels here my apples I'm going to insert the Apple into the warm caramel moving it around like so making sure that the Apple is evenly covered and then you pull it out doesn't that look great now I take a little a knife or spatula and you just wipe the excess off in the bottom and I'm going to place this on top of a baking sheet that I've lined with wax paper or parchment that I've really well buttered and that's the key you have to remember to butter the wax paper because that will prevent your apples from sticking to the paper as they set now this is a great time to that you can decorate the caramel apples if you wish you can top them with some chopped peanuts or with some baker's semi-sweet or white chocolate melted drizzle the chocolate on or even some crushed Oreos now we're going to make our caramel apple nachos so what I've done ahead of time is melted 18 Kraft caramels in two teaspoons of water and i microwave them on high for one and a half minutes and I took it out every 30 seconds and I stirred the caramels to make sure that they were melting nicely so that's all done I've also sliced two apples and I've arranged them nicely on this plate and just overlapping you can do it in a circle as well if you want so I'm going to top the apples with the melted caramels just drizzle back and forth all over just like you would your regular nachos and then for the topping I'm going to top with one cup jet puff miniature marshmallows and just price them all around - crushed Oreo cookies and a quarter cup chopped dry roasted peanuts and there you have it these caramel apple trees are so easy and they're fun to make at your next Halloween party you're going to be a hit for more great recipes and videos visit us at craft canada.com [Music] you ",

        "content": "today we're going to be making some caramel apples and they're so yummy and decorated so cute so here are some of the things that you're going to need we have caramels and they're just the craft american classic caramels um that are really yummy and then we're gonna use oreos with some of the toppings and then we also have some white chocolate chips some milk chocolate chips which are my favorite i love that kind and then we have some plates to put them on more caramels toppings these are just really fun little things that you can use um to top them really caramel and apples are really the only thing you need but we want to make them a little bit more fun and then we also have some toothpicks and we're going to cut the apples into pieces and i think um with the caramels you don't just melt them down i think you add a little bit of water but it says five apples washed well drained one package of caramels and two tablespoons of water so we're just going to go ahead and start on the caramel you want green apples and you want green apples if you like that i like green apples they taste better so i've just put some wax paper down and it says to butter one of the pans it says to butter the pans but i'm going to use spray pan and put over the top of this wax paper and i made the mistake of not doing this last time and it stuck really bad so make sure to put something that's going to make it not so here are all of the caramels just without the wrappers on them getting ready to be cooked warmed up and now i'm just getting four tablespoons of water and i'm just gonna put that on let's see what does it say i think it says medium low heat so medium low heat and now i'm just going to let it simmer and it said or let it cook but it says to make sure and stir it constantly so that it doesn't burn and then after this is melted that's when you're going to dip your apples so let's get our apples ready so we have these regular ones we have these ones that will have a toothpick in them and then these will be if i can do it little tiny bite-sized pieces cute i turned the heat down a little bit because it was starting to boil and you don't want it to boil you just want it to melt so i turn the heat down just just a hair bit i'm going to do crushed oreos as one of the toppings and to do that i am just putting i don't know that's probably good like six oreos in a bag i'm gonna let all the air out of it most of it so for the chocolate i have white chocolate and milk chocolate what i want to do is just take it and do one at a time in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time cook it for 30 seconds stir it if it still is lumpy put it in the microwave cook it for another 30 seconds do that until it's completely melted and smooth so what i'm doing is i'm taking the apple piece and i'm dipping it thoroughly in the caramel and then it's dripping a lot and to speed that up i'm just kind of spinning it a little bit that helps to get the excess caramel off a little bit faster i think and then i take it and i have a second plate here that i'm using to put the toppings on it so i don't mind if i spill the spillings aren't going to get all in the caramel dish and i can actually get the bottom of it really easily just by kind of doing that so it's all around and over the whole apple i can just set it over here cool perfect looks delicious thank you if you hadn't noticed michael's helping me with this project doing a good job to figure out how to do it without all of the caramel dripping to the bottom in a big pile so i think that's really good it looks really good too so if the caramel is too hot then it'll fall right off the apple it'll it'll melt a lot and if it's not hard not cool or not hot enough then it won't even stick to the apple and things won't stick to it toppings won't stick to it so i've had to heat and reheat this enough so many times probably three or four times so far just to make sure it always con stays the right you know the right consistency the right coolness level so that it will stick to the apple and it'll stick to the toppings but it won't spill all over the cookie sheet so it's kind of a delicate balance you have to try to do so some of the ways that i've found work best um if you don't want the caramel to get everywhere kind of shake it off a little bit and then put some sort of like sprinkles or something on the bottom so the caramel will just go over the sprinkles and not just go lay flat kind of like this one and then uh we are starting to run low on caramel so it's easier to just put some chocolate on it if you have some leftover chocolate and you can put sprinkles on that these are so cute look at how cute that is i'm very easy to eat very clean actually for a caramel apple i feel like um so there's lots of different ways to do it you can do put whatever toppings you want on it and just be really creative and have fun i hope you like this video they're super easy very cute easy to eat too that's what i like about them they're not as hard as a real caramel apple go ahead and try out this and let me know if you liked it and we'll see you later ",

        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hi I'm Anthony and I'm going to show you how to make caramel candies and first step is just to get your ingredients ready your first ingredient is sugar 1 cup of white granulated sugar that's seven and a half ounces ingredient number two isn't quite so obvious it's a quarter cup of light corn syrup you're probably asking well why corn syrup let's find out this is sucrose take a fable sugar it's made up of a bunch of carbons and some oxygens and some hydrogen's to fill the clutch and as you probably already know sucrose has a tendency to form crystals and you can heat those crystals up or dissolve them in water and it becomes a liquid but as soon as it dries out or cools down it's going to become a crystal again and if you're making candy with sugar sucrose then that's going to lead to a sort of grainy sandy texture in your candy you don't want that especially in caramels so one method to prevent the crystallization of sucrose once it's in a liquid form is to introduce some sort of acid like lemon juice or cream of tartar what that does is split sucrose down the middle into glucose and fructose which won't crystallize unfortunately since assets tastes a little sour you can bite into a lemon if you want to test that your candy is not going to be a sweet and you probably want your candy to be sweet so another solution to prevent sucrose from crystallizing is to introduce something else that prevents the sucrose molecules from touching each other and actually forming crystals sort of like creating a barrier around the molecules so that they don't form crystals with one enough and that's where the corn syrup comes in and i'll demonstrate let's suppose these three-dimensional blogs are sucrose molecules when you push them together in one space they have this tendency to form a crystal a sugar crystal but you can tear them apart by melting them with heat or dissolving them and add something like say warm syrup then pushing them together the corn syrup interferes with these molecules ability to recrystallize and so you don't get this grainy texture as if you are biting into a sugar cube you get a smoother texture as if this were still a liquid and that's what you want for a caramel and nice thing about corn syrup is that it's mostly glucose anyway so it'll add sweetness to your candy and also be completely flavorless next ingredient is four tablespoons of butter that's half a stick and the fat will serve a similar purpose as the corn syrup the salt will accent the sweetness and this is salted butter so that's alright but if you're using unsalted butter you're going to want to add about a quarter teaspoon of this stuff and your last big ingredient is going to be one cup of heavy cream again that's more fat to prevent recrystallization of the sugar plus the proteins in the cream will react with the sugar and create that dark brown caramel color that is characteristic of caramel plus it's pretty tasty vanilla extract is an optional ingredient but it adds a nice start off with a glass pan about two quarts be the size you want and line it with either parchment paper wax paper or aluminum foil any of those will work but if you use aluminum foil you're probably going to want to grease the aluminum foil once it's in the pan just to guarantee that your candy won't stick to it sometimes I have problems with aluminum foil sometimes I don't so with ingredients on hand grab yourself a fairly large size cooking pot roberson mixing and then start tossing in your ingredients one after the other but the only thing I'd hold off on is the vanilla is if you cook it too long then you'll cook the flavor away and then though what's appointing and adding it at that point so remember save with vanilla to the end and in the corn syrup turn the heat on to about medium so it looks like my butter is about melting so now I'm going to add this to the pot this is a candy thermometer and it's absolutely vital for this process and I'll tell you why so you may or may not have realized it but the cream and butter that you have any mixture have moisture do they have water in them and water changes it stayed at 212 degrees it becomes steam it evaporates so liquid water itself will not get above 212 degrees because it turns with something else at that one but your candy in the mixture is actually going to want to get much hotter the sugar will get way hotter than 212 but the water in it because it has this 212 cap is actually going to cool down the whole mixture so as water evaporates the less water you have the less cooling you have and the less cooling you have the hotter your candy can actually get and it turns out when your candy is about 250 degrees maybe a little bit lower than that then enough water has evaporated and create the perfect proportion between water and sugar to where if you pour it out and let it cool you can cut it up and it'll be they'll be solid pieces that you can hold in your hand but they'll still help in your mouth so I've got my candy thermometer in you want to make sure this little nub the point that actually reads the temperature is not touching the bottom of the pan otherwise you're going to get a reading on the pan and not the liquid that's inside the pan and it's not such a problem with this monitor that had this little foot on the bottom but it's just something below and this just clips to the side here so something to note is that once it gets to this boiling stage and mixing it too much will help those sucrose molecules find each other and reform crystals so you want to minimize mixing but you still want to stir it a little bit just so that your things are even and so the thermometer will get a reading on the average temperature not just the temperature at the side of the pan so check this up now in about 20 minutes into the cooking process and it's almost almost done it's almost reach 250 this is way thicker it's got that dark amber color from the proteins and the cream reacting with the sugar so it's looking a lot more like caramel and it's smelling are more like here I'll too so this is all good sign that things are going according to plan so far just a few more minutes all right we're just about at 250 here I turned off the heat and pour this into the prepared pan I do it pretty quickly that stuff hardens quite fast in the meantime you'll remember the hand we cooked in is now coated with hardened caramel and that's going to be a pain to scrub but this is just sugar and fat and it'll melt with you so if you fill this thing up with water put it back on the stove heat the water up to boiling for a little bit will practically clean itself this caramel now is about half way cool I can tell because it's still soft in the middle but when I lift it up it holds its shape I'm going to pull it out of this pan and use this time to do a little bit of cutting and shaping of course you can cut this just straight I'm going to cut it at an angle though that way I can make some nice diamond shaped pieces all right let's reveal true crush equals glucose fructose sucrose forms crystals if you normally don't want in your cannon because it forms a gritty sandy sort of texture and can prevent that with corn syrup corn syrup plus sucrose will prevent the sucrose from actually forming Chris bunch of sucrose is in its liquid form 204 few degrees is known as the firm ball stage it's perfect for Carla represents the perfect combination between water and sugar very much higher than that you get a really hard candy very much lower than that I think they're soft caramel thoughts I'd never hardens protein or sugar over each horse causes a chemical reaction which gives us the caramel color and new concept candy equals delicious so if you have any tips know any tricks have any questions leave a comment let me know otherwise happy cooking ",

        "content": "hey what's up this is Ryan from flying saucers kepi in an art in Santa Monica and I'm here to show you today exactly how to make the infamous caramel macchiato so the caramel macchiato is currently one of the most popular drinks in the world and to make it is relatively simple but you do need very high quality caramel and this particular bottle of caramel per pump it gives you one ounce so for a 16 ounce caramel macchiato I'm going to use three ounces of caramel so we have ice-cold nonfat milk here 16 ounces of it and we're going to use my favorite glass mug my lucky mug and quite simply just going to pump three ounces of pure culinary caramel into the nonfat milk and some places he'll tell you to add vanilla powder but if it's high enough quality caramel you definitely don't need to this is gonna taste great now we're gonna use a culinary temperature gauge because like baking foaming milk is very exact and the trick is you need to have it top out at between 155 and 160 degrees any hotter than 170 and you're burning out all the figures of the milk and you really need to just dump it out and start over so between 155 and 160 is where we're aiming so let's step over to the steam wand of our beautiful espresso machine we're going to dip the tip of the steam wand last into the milk there if it's too far out it's gonna splatter everywhere if it's too far in it's just gonna heat up the milk but not make real foam so turn on the steam launch and you do it more by sound than by sight you just want to hear a faint hissing and you can see it rule pulling and sucking in bubbles it's not it's not popping them out thank you like this that's way too much so it's sucking in bubbles and not unlike a steak this is gonna keep on cooking itself after I stop the heat as you can see right now that's why I rolled off at around 140 and it's gonna continue until about 159 160 there it is 150 that take it off and we're gonna set this aside while we make our double espresso setting it aside and doing the foam first works to give the foam a little time to harden up they'll really stiffen up and it's gonna make it this great really tight foam all the big bubbles will pop during the 30 seconds or so in which we're making the espresso so here's our Porta filter we're gonna step over to the espresso grinder we're gonna fill it up with espresso tamp it down put it in here and extract a double espresso place it in the cartridge there I'm gonna pull it until it's really heaping over there's no set amount of holes it's really just until it's really full and that then we're gonna grab the tamper and with 30 pounds of pressure I'm gonna tamp it down clean it off a little the first tamp was thirty pounds of pressure the second tamp 15 and the way that pro baristas learn is by tamping on a scale it's the only way to really learn exactly what it exactly how much it is so clean that off there we go it's a nice espresso puff I'm gonna walk on over to the espresso machine put it in at a 45 degree angle lock it into place to demet asses now we're gonna pull our espresso shot and the extraction time needs to be between 18 and 22 seconds it's really very vital so let's see now we want the to drip cycles to be it's a really doesn't represent like Mouse tails not too fat and not drips these ones are perfect now the reason they're so light brown is that secure crema which is an oily base that floats on top of the espresso and that's the flavor center if your espresso comes out looking like black coffee with no oily base on top you really need to dump it out and adjust your grind and/or tamp it a little bit harder so now we're done take our double espressos first see now we have this great beautiful caramel e foam with a ladle you're gonna hold back the foam you're gonna pour just the steamed milk like so pull a little bit of foam now with our espressos the trick to having it look really beautiful is when we pour it we're gonna pour it very very slowly basically mimicking the mouse tails from the specimen the point of this being that the big milk layer under there is full of air bubbles and it's gonna support buoyant espresso as you can see there's a layer of espresso forming on the top and it never really makes it down to the bottom and it's great because when the customer sips it they get espresso first that have the nice caramel milk finish there we go see that great looking fade you're gonna see it's slowly descending and it looks almost like storm clouds [Music] see ya [Music] thanks for watching to learn how to make more great coffee things click on these videos ",

        "content": "today we're making caramel white chocolate butterfinger apples first you'll need a buttered plate or tray that you're going to be putting the apples on you're going to need an a package of caramels unwrapped and in a bowl you're going to need some white chocolate chips or you can use milk chocolate if you'd like you're also going to need some mini butterfingers you'll want to unwrap those put those in the ziplock bag bust those up you'll also want your favorite kind of Apple i'm using Golden Delicious today but you can certainly use other things and of course you'll want your popsicle stick that's going to go through the top of your Apple here so first we're going to take care of the caramels first you're going to want to take your caramels have them all unwrapped put them in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of water put them in the microwave for three minutes stir them after each minute just to be sure that they're melted I have that here then we're going to take our apple with our stick already in it and we're going to just dip it in on its side here make sure we're covering it you can cover all the way to the top of the stick if you'd like or or not I think I'll stop there then you're going to want to tip it back on itself so it runs back onto itself instead of running onto your plate takes just a minute or so to do that make sure it's not going to run anywhere you don't want it all right then I'm going to put it on the buttered plate then I'm going to stick it in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes for it to harden up while we're waiting for that to firm up in the refrigerator if you haven't already go ahead and take your butter fingers out of the package get him in a ziploc bag and get those smashed up to find into fine pieces you can use a rolling pin to roll them out and use a hammer whatever it is you're whatever your preferred choice of busting something up is I haven't already mine already in a shallow bowl here you'll also want to take your white chocolate chips have those in a bowl as well put those in the microwave for about two minutes make sure you've added a cup tablespoons of shortening to make it a better consistency to adhere to the apples you'll want to stir after about every 20 seconds to get those straight in and I have those all stirred mixed right here so our next step when our apples caramel has firmed up on the apples we're going to roll them into the white chocolate just similar to in a similar way that we did the apples and then we're going to immediately roll them into the butterfingers so same thing I'm going to roll it and again I didn't get it melted all the way but you know what butterfingers going to cover it so we won't seals blobs there and make sure falls back on itself like we had the we like what we did with caramel earlier like I said it's not that pretty right now but it doesn't really matter so just make sure anything that's going to fall off falls back into your bowl okay and then immediately take it and roll it into your butterfingers go all the way around get the bottom get the side just cover it thoroughly and then what we're going to do we're going to put this right back again on our butter plate it's going to go right back in the fridge again and it's going we need it to harden up for probably about 15 minutes and then actually it'll be ready to eat you can store these in the refrigerator I would suggest though if you're going to do that before you eat them take them out about 15 minutes before you eat them so the chocolate has a chance to soften up a little bit if you try and cut them when the chocolate is just straight hard from the refrigerator they'll bust into a bunch of pieces so this will go into onto our plate almost stick it in the fridge and let's look in a second now we're going to get this i'm going to cut the one that I made earlier what we're going to do we're just going to go down the sides of the popsicle stick instead of having to eat this thing whole like this it makes a little difficult we'll just cut it so we're going to go down the side here then we're going to go down the other side and then after we've gone down this side we're going to flip it around and go down the other this side as well I'll go ahead and do this side right now so you can see what it looks like on the inside here you will need a big strong knife for this because it doesn't happen easily but you can see all our different layers here you can see our caramel layer our white chocolate layer and our Butterfinger layer there we go we have caramel chocolate Butterfinger apples you can also like I said use milk chocolate you could use any kind of candy bar you wanted eminem's whatever you'd like but very tasty ",

        "content": "it's tutorial Tuesday and I don't know about you but what's Halloween without caramel apples if you love caramel apples as much as I do stay tuned for the tutorial so here is everything that we're going to need of course apples because what are caramel apples without the Apple I chose to use Granny Smith because i like the sour and sweet taste combination but you can use whatever Apple you choose caramel and I chose to use the prepackaged caramel but if you'd like you can make your own caramel from scratch and this is the brand of caramels that I used wooden skewers and these are to hold our apples on but you can also use lollipop sticks or even popsicle sticks if you'd like chopped peanuts and this is going to be toppings for our caramel apples a few candy melts and this is also going to be toppings for our caramel apples and you don't have to use the peanuts for the candy melts these are optional so the first thing you're going to do which I've already done off camera is make sure you wash your apples and you want to make sure that you watch them really well under some warm water so that you can get all the wax off and once they're all wash do you want to make sure that you dry them all the way completely because if they're wet or if they do have a little bit of wax the caramel won't stick so after you've done that we're going to take our skewer and each apple has a little center hole we're just going to poke the skewer right through the center and you might need an adult to help you do this part see just like that and your Apple will sit nicely on top of it so I'm going to poke the other two so my apples are poked with their skewers and now on to our next step what we're going to do next is we're going to melt down all of our caramel and how we're going to do that is we're going to put so I have one package of caramels here so I'm going to put a little bit of water maybe about one tablespoon of water and then we're going to put it in the microwave for about a minute and a half then we're going to stir it take it out and stir it and then put it back in for another minute and a half take it out stir it and it should be all melted ok so our caramel is all melted and it's time to dip our apples and this is the time that you're going to put all your toppings on once they're dipped once the caramel is still sticky before it sets is when you're going to add your toppings so here we go so you take your Apple you put it upside down you dunk it in the caramel and you just give it a nice twist to coat your Apple just like that and you let some of the excess just drip right off of it so this first Apple we're just going to leave it just basic just the basic caramel apple and then we're going to place it on our wax paper and the trick so that your Apple does not stick to your wax paper is make sure that you put a little bit of butter or maybe vegetable spray on your wax paper so it doesn't stick so then after we do that we just place it upside down and we let it set so the next Apple I'm going to do I'm going to put a little bit of peanut toppings on it so we do the exact same thing we put it in give her a little twirl we let some of that caramel drip right off and we dip it right inside there and we get a disc Oded as you'd like just like that and then we do the same thing and we put it to set just like that and our last one I'm going to do a little bit of chocolate drizzle but with this one I'm going to let the caramel set first before i put the drizzle on it so again we're gonna just give her a twirl in our caramel see just like this swirl it around then we're going to let the excess drip off wait and then we're going to put it down to set the rest so I will be back to show you how I do my drizzle once they're all set I'm back and my candy apples are pretty much set but I just wanted to come back to show you how I do the drizzle so the bag of candy melts that I had I just put them in some hot water and just waited for them to melt so all I'm going to do is take my scissors and just clip off the end right there and just snip off the end like that van I'm going to take my apple like so take my drizzle in this hand sorry this is kind of awkward when you're recording it and I'm just going to squeeze it all the way to the end and then just drizzle it on just like that it's been sitting for a while so it's not as liquidy as I'd like it but you guys get the point right I hope so but pretty much you just do that and do whatever kind of design that you like and there you have it folks my caramel apples we have one caramel with some chocolate drizzle one regular caramel and one with some peanuts I hope this helped you guys thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time bye ",

        "content": "hi everyone today I will be showing you all how I make my homemade caramel apples I hope that you all enjoy please thumbs up and let's begin so here are my apples I've allowed them to sit in hot water for a few minutes you can also put them in boiling water for about 30 seconds it might change the color of the apple just slightly but that's okay this is basically just to remove any wax or residue that the Apple might have because this is a lot of the reason why a lot of people can get their caramel to stick and it's because they don't clean them properly so we're going to go ahead and vigorously wipe it down really good because sometimes they have wax on them and that will not allow the caramel to stick to the apple once we're done with this we'll move on to the next step and as you can see I do spend quite a bit of time really getting in there and removing any of the wax or residue that Apple might have all right so next I'm going to place my apples in the freezer for about one hour I like them to get nice and cold so that when the hot caramel hits them it gets cooled quickly and it doesn't you know just melt off like I said it the hot water might change the color of the apples slightly but that's fine it doesn't change the taste or anything alright everybody so I'm going to show you how I blend to my peanuts and I'm just taking this brand here from Walmart and I'm taking unsalted peanuts you can find them in various stores a lot of times you won't find them unsalted I just prefer it because I don't like salt so much salt in the apples themselves then I'm going to go ahead and take my blender and then chop and grind so as you can see it does grind them a little more than I would like but I'm not going to sit there and try to cut all these by hand so I'm just going to remove the little blade and then just dump it in a bowl and we'll use this later and I also have another mixture over here with pecans and with the peanuts because I think that's delicious I'm you can use any toppings that you like I'm just going to go with the classics and stick with these for today but you can at chocalate Eminem's all different kinds of goodies alright so I'm going to be using a stainless steel pot but if this is your first time I would definitely stick with a nonstick just so nothing sticks to it but I've pretty much you know experienced with this recipe so I'm using my stainless steel one cup of butter and we're also going to put one cup of light corn syrup I did have a cup of light and half a cup of dark now we'll just go ahead and throw that in there and then I want to take two cups of light brown sugar and this is the organic one take one can of the condensed sweetened milk and I really love this brand lolly cheetah it's just it just has a really delicious flavour to it and then we're just going to pour all of that in there and now that that's done we're going to go ahead and let it heat up how do you guys like my spatula it says mr. right on one side and then miss is always right on the other isn't that cute I love it so right now we are in a medium-high heat you can start off with a medium heat just so that um you keep it on a low and it doesn't burn out burn on you but you have to constantly be babysitting this so you have to constantly be stirring it so it doesn't burn at the bottom because it will easily burn at the bottom if you do not stir it throughout the whole process so you also want to get a candy thermometer but I would definitely not use of meat thermometer or anyth any other kind of thermometer because you can really burn yourself candy when hot or sugar when hot can really really hurt and that's happened to me it even got me goosebumps right now just thinking of it I'm going to go ahead and just continue stirring this up and I do this throughout the whole process everything just dissolved so now we're just going to let it build up the heat boil and you don't want to under boil because then it'll be too soft and you don't want to over boil because then it can be too hard so you want to make sure that you're right at 200 and 45 degree because that's actually a really good temperature to have for the apples it's beginning to boil now and I just have to say be careful because if this if you get burned this will really hurt so just be very cautious and continue on stirring because it will burn very easily at the bottom especially if you're using stainless steel so just make sure you're constantly stirring and stirring and stirring and you would definitely want to have a very deep pot because once this is nothing once it starts boiling even more it's going to rise so just make sure you have a really nice deep pot that you can work with all right so once you reach you 245\u00b0 go ahead and turn it off continue stirring so it does not stick at the bottom I don't let Bubba's near this at all when I'm cooking caramel because it can easily kind of like jump at you and it burns so definitely don't have your kids involved in this part of it you can definitely have them a part of the decorating of apples which is a lot funner but yeah Bubba's is a mile away right now watching Minecraft videos we're gonna let this cool down just a little before we go ahead and add the vanilla now that it's cooled down a bit I mean it's still bubbling but it's not anywhere near where it was a earlier I'm going to go ahead and add two teaspoons of vanilla 1/2 even if you like like almond oil I've done them with a little bit of almond oil as well and you know it's just based on liking you can do whatever you like then go ahead and just mix this up really well I'm still going to allow this to cool down just a couple more minutes and then I'm going to grab my frozen apples ah while this cools down and then we'll dip them and then we'll add the peanuts and all the good stuff alright everybody so here's my Apple and I basically just put these apple sticks right in there I got these from Walmart you can find them in the baking goods area and it's nice and frozen really cold I have my caramel and I also have some parchment paper I put it right with my baking pan and then I lightly greased it with some butters so there are my ingredients let's get started so I'm going to take my apple and I'm just going to go ahead and dip it right into the caramel make sure your pans not too hot and then just dip it I like to take it all the way up to the stick and then just allow it to remove the excess on its own you don't want to overdo it with hitting it or making it lose some of the caramel if it doesn't want to just because then it'll be too thin and just wipe it right off just like that and then while it's still hot go ahead and grab your ingredients and then dip the Apple into those ingredients if you wait too long they won't stick because apples frozen so you have to remember that it'll pull off really fast they're not sticking all of a sudden so you have to be a little quick with this so I'm going to use one more angle for you guys I basically just dip it you kind of have to work fast if the caramel starts getting cooled down on you you can simply heat it up again and it'll work with you you kind of have to work fast because once the caramel cools down the peanuts don't stick so you're going to go ahead and work a little fast here perfect then I basically just press on it just let the peanuts stick nicely on them and if you missed any spots just go back in with your hand and apply them just press down on them but not too hard otherwise the peanuts will sink into the caramel and that's not always very visually pretty so it'll be just as tasty though it just piss visually pretty so there we go nicely covered and then I just pressed down on it and then I just give it a tap just so it removes any excess and put it on parchment paper stick it in the fridge for about 15 minutes and then they're good to go so if you have any left over caramel you can always just grab your parchment paper I lightly greased it with a little bit of butter once your candy is cooled down and you can actually you know pour it on and and put it and fold it and put it in parchment paper you can actually just go ahead and store this and use it in various things like cakes even at the Lich's cake that I baked it was I used caramel that I had used previously to make some apples and look at how good that is you can even make it thick enough by increasing the temperature and that way it's like a hard caramel candy it's oh so good and it serves as a great gift also so I definitely keep these in the freezer for a while until I need them and they always come in handy all right family so here we have our apples as you can see they turned out amazing they are so yummy I had a slice already it is so good and I hope that you guys enjoyed this video found it helpful if you did please click like let me know what you want to see next and I'll see you guys tomorrow take care everyone bye ",

        "content": "[Music] so the first thing I've been instructed to do is to pop some popcorn and I think typically kantha uses her air popper but an alternative method to that is to put your 1/3 of a cup through the cup of popcorn or little skin and the bag on there hold it over two minutes two minutes okay okay so sorry so you're gonna need 16 cups of popcorn how much does that make that won't we just did your climbing you three bags of that so but first we have a pan here this is one I got at home are to go pack you could get at the Dollar Tree wherever if you don't have a pan that has the high oh you need the high so many high sites run when you're storing so what you wanna do is you want to spray your pan first now you need the 16 cups of popcorn over here yes but you need to measure down don't roll your eyes at me and what you could do to save yourself time poppy if you have like extra time you could just go ahead and pop the popcorn and just put it in a bag so you don't have to do it all at one time one time and it okay oh it keeps and then the even once you make a caramel corn that keeps awesome I had someone who ate it like a month later okay this is three hey wait was that me I think and I hate it but later once - before look about right that looks not right all right know what now you need to put this in the oven yeah I'm gonna get to five do I put it in the oven Cathy because you don't want to put your caramel on full popcorn okay so what it's on a Tootsie 250 so just as you're preparing the Karen we'll just leave that in the oven okay okay don't worry about it don't set a timer okay so turn it on medium heat so you need one stick of butter salt it and Sultan thanks it's unsalted and I will link the recipe where I got this actually got a whole recipe this is basic butter or margarine do not use margarine have you used I have it does not taste thickened nice to say it does not taste the same yeah what you need a cup of brown sugar do I like there's a better melts no no no seriously seriously I don't feel right about this just stuff in and then you need a half a cup of corn syrup mmm and then you need a quarter of a cup 1/4 of a teaspoon I'm sorry of salt right here that would have been a lot of salt stir do I have to watch this stir it starting to boil mm-hmm this is a gentle boil isn't it just ever so gently boiling not even prick all right now you notice at the timer for five minutes oh really so don't say yes yeah don't touch it Hey Oh put it down and set the timer for five minutes okay so I just don't touch it don't touch it just leave it should I turn it down no no okay leave it will see this would scare me this scares me excuse me it's boiling like it's okay it's not hurt it what if I burn it not gonna work have you ever burnt it no never never never trust me you don't trust me boil it away it's still scary it's not scary it's scary all right so we're counting down what happens when it goes off well right now take your other two your metal spoon know what the middle space spray spray the middle space okay okay don't need to get your popcorn oh now okay thank you so set your pan over on the folder okay burner them yeah all right so no this doesn't take your pen your baking soda yeah vanilla vanilla I'm gonna top top stir just dump it in your spoon just be careful that you're not a little I just do it Oh usually that yeah away from me so it's not like you just earned my shirt I think I've messed this up stop it's just all okay now let's pour over the popcorn just kind of dress good yep drizzle oh okay just like this yeah yeah oh I'm gonna take too long with this mm-hmm take your metal spoon over there they spray okay start twice really oh lord have mercy this is library 15 was that that bad I'm gonna need a drink I'm stopping no it wasn't that bad no it wasn't that scary yep was it but I don't like things where I haven't made things a hurry you know the 20 miles leave everything in a hurry that is true mister I don't know why it's kind of scares me a little bit yeah okay everyday you want to take it out now what we can take a lower then you'll stir it some more  okay good enough yep just gonna let you make this for me can you take it out the last time yeah hey you see why you need the tall edges used to regular cookie sheet it would be all over the place so then you'll do 15 more minutes and then oh okay all right last 15 miles over to us so we're finished they're gonna pull it out stir it up okay just dump it dump it you know I'm kind of messy yeah that's last thing and then just take this and just break it up and you could probably wash this pan if you learn to make more sorry I told you I'm a mess okay now was it really that bad I mean does take time maybe you have something to do in between yeah that's true too second role with this batch you know it varies of course how much has been on your ingredients but I would say it'll cost around between a dollar fifty and two dollars a batch okay that would give you four of the pre rows oh okay so it would be about you know fifty cents under fifty cents so was it as bad as you thought is that it's difficult as you thought to make it's not difficult at all um it's just something you know setting the time are getting up and coming and doing it and so it's relatively hands-off from that standpoint my thing is you know we were here talking and I didn't fall asleep that would be my concern I have to still make it when you're don't make it when you're tired however very easy to make and it is truly one it is the most delicious caramel corn I have ever had and I've had it a lot of places and it is truly the best it really and you could add nuts to it if you'd like yeah nuts can be expensive so that would actually out to the cop but yeah it's still yummy that's right it is it's wonderful so highly recommend you give it a shot [Music] ",

decided to make these delicious candy apples at coated it in caramel and chocolate but you can customize it any way you like make sure you follow me on my channel as well as craving food adventures calm I'm going to be making a lot of apple recipes this fall before I go any further with this recipe do make sure you subscribe to my channel and ring the bell that youtube spell icon that will notify you every time I upload a new video now let's get making these Delicious apples to prep we need to remove any wax that may be present on the surface of the Apple I have a pot of boiling water here and I'm going to add 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar you can use any vinegar that you like you can also use any kind of apples that you like to balance the sweet of the caramel and chocolate I've chosen that tart granny smith apples I've also chosen to use snacking apples which are much smaller than a regular sized apple I'm going to immerse the apple in the water just for a few seconds and once that's done I'm going to remove it and place it on a towel [Music] once all of these are done I'm going to wipe each one dry using a kitchen towel [Music] for best results I'm going to refrigerate the apples before use if the Apple is cold it's going to set the caramel quickly it's also going to help to dry out the apples once all of my apples are chilled I'm going to remove them and take the stems off if the stem is nice and long one tug and it should come right out I like to make these apples in smaller batches about eight at a time if you find that you're struggling with a shorter stem just leave it on candy apple sticks are available in most stores I bought these bamboo lollipop sticks for another recipe and they work really well they're sharp on one end and they are so easy to pierce through the core of the Apple I like to go about 3/4 through the fruit so it's nice and secure if all you can find are the flat candy sticks you might want to stab the Apple first with a knife just to help the steak goal right through I have about 2 cups of walnuts here and I'm just going to crush them in my mortar and pestle you can use any other nuts of your choice pecans peanuts and almonds they all work well I also picked up a bunch of other sprinkles and candies from the bulk food store I have some pumpkins fall leaves and some Reese's you can use whatever you like and how much ever you like these are totally customizable the hardest part of this recipe is taking off the candy wrapper on these caramels I have a pound of caramel candies here and I'm going to add two tablespoons of milk [Music] after a minute give the stir you can see that the candy has started to melt but it's not quite as smooth yet I'm just going to put this back in the microwave for another minute use a bowl much larger than the quantity off the caramels as it does bubble and rice and as soon as you see it throught again I'm going to turn off the power this is now perfect but you're going to have to work fast as the caramel starts to thicken and Harden as it cools I'm going to be using a silicone mat as my base and I'm going to swirl the apples in the caramel and then quickly dip them in the walnut crumbs I just want to note if you want a caramel look but not necessarily dealing with the caramel you can also use butterscotch chips they are a bit more opaque than caramel but they will work just as well to make room I'm just going to move these onto a parchment paper line dish you want to make sure that you're never setting these directly on a plate as it will stick to the plate if using other candies or sprinkles just stick them on to the caramel or dip them in as soon as possible [Music] although the caramel sets pretty quickly it's still a bit tacky so you are going to need to stick this back in your fridge for an hour once it's set I'm going to add a layer of chocolate I'm using about 8 ounces of melted chocolate I'm just going to drizzle the chocolate and have some fun with it for the walnut apples I'm going to add more walnut crumbs on top of the chocolate drizzle [Music] if using candies or sprinkles do the same the chocolate takes longer to set than the caramel so you have a bit more time to decorate you can use any candies or chocolate that you fancy look how gorgeous these are you can serve these to your guests as is or wrap them up for the perfect take-home gift thank you so much for joining me in curving Santa ventures I hope you enjoyed this delicious recipe for candy coated apples as you can see it's super super easy

for them or whatever you know but I remember making them as a kid I haven't made them and forever I'm not gonna pretend that I have and there's probably a reason that we didn't make them a lot I don't know why but I just think that there are pain somehow but anyways we'll find out what you need some apples I got five medium-sized apples caramel on these craft caramels on this 14 ounce pack gold looked high and low walked all over wall more end up having a customer help me find sticks because you know nobody knew her popsicle sticks were at I don't know why but anyways when I did find them it were like three bucks this was like 75 cents so I figure I'll cut them in half I'll put a point on them and that's what we use but if you got popsicle sticks use those and then we're going to put some kind of nuts on these are pecan ships we're gonna roll them in that so it's pretty straightforward let me get some stuff prepared and we'll get it started so there you go i got all the caramel zhou unwrapped and got them in a saucepan got it on medium heat and I it's what you tablespoons of water in with it also so anyways I imagine it's gonna take a minute for these to get melted up once they do I'll bring them back and we'll get these apples all right I have a taking the I've taken the caramel out of the pan just as I think this be easier to roll it in I think it fits the apple butter you also want some kind of grease pan now I'm putting this on the hot I because I want to keep that caramel molten but all I've done is taking a pan and put a piece of London for a line and put some butter on it so it won't stick and then that's it that on there hey just do that over and over till you get all the app is covered so let's get too hard at this point unless something gets screwed up of course it could I can burn myself or something this may not even turn so anyways I'm not gonna make you sit you this what we're going to do is we're going to dip these apples and caramel dislike this we're gonna let them cool and we'll put them in refrigerator let them cool for just a little bit and then I'm a roll them in the nuts so I'll bring you back for that I had originally planned to your role he's in his off these nut fragments but I don't know if that's going to work that's all the frayed up huh well the idea was put notes on him I guess I should have put it on when it was much hotter I just didn't didn't know so we learned we're going to have to do then grant pull this free now see it's now I now I remember why you don't do this so we'll pull one free in this plate so you can see it live TV folks is how it works and put the nuts on the plate like I originally had planned yeah aesthetically pleasing I'm not guaranteeing actually i think that uh yeah you're better off the bomb if you're looking for something it looks good well there you go the nuts just will not stick to that caramel it come will stick to anything else but it won't stick to those anyways not everything I do turns out perfect or even close to it so I bet you if you were here you'd still eat one so it's just time consuming Yuki obviously if you keep rolling around in this not so it's going to pick it up so let me get the notes put on them you can see that this is up this is more work than I get some printed so yeah let me get these fixed up and we'll come back give one a taste test and see if they're worth eating and I hopefully they taste better than what I'm dealing with here so there you go in the end they turned out then the nuts did give me a little wrestle but you know I was trying to make a video and do a hit same time sounds kind of embarrassing but Indiana has had to roll it really hard in the nuts I didn't have enough to put it on all five of them so the four-room you can see i want to show you they all did turn out in the end now it's time to taste test one and i used granny smith and delicious three grand Smith into red delicious and they get a big caramel thing here at the bottom of it so as you eat through the Apple you can chew on that down there tune get some extra caramel mmm I know I said all the time I sell look I am mmm that is good very very good well like I say little spooky when you're doing it and getting done it in a while and you're making a video at the same time but in the end wrestle with it um oh man it was really good so I hope you try hope it turns out for you it's a good little project to do on a Saturday if you have some apples hand turn them into something keeping an open and keep them in refrigerator for a day or so i cant need five apples at one time but anyways I better get going and get started y'all have a good day paper check it out ",

        "content": "hi guys and welcome to level 80 cakes it's me chef Anna and fall is upon us which got me thinking about how school is in session right now maybe some fairs are coming into your town and I really was thinking about making some candy apple yum this will be the perfect fall treat or your Halloween treat let's go get Megan some candy apple [Music] all right what we need to begin on these candied apples are some green granny smith apples now I'm we're going to recommend probably about four apples and we need to take out the stem yep and use a fun little popsicle stick or lollipop stick whatever you guys can find and we're going to stick it right in the center and push it down it's really hard unless you're Superman I recommend using the end of your pot as a hammer Wow all right well we're going to need next is a saucepan we're going to add 1/2 cup of water to this [Music] we're going to add two cups of granulated sugar [Music] and then we're going to add one cup of light corn syrup [Music] now this is pretty much the recipe to make our candied apples one way of also doing it is adding your red food coloring in right now or if you're like me I'm going to use so vism and little candies and that goes in later but for now we need to whisk it up get all those sugars melt it in with the water in the corn syrup and then we're going to stick it over a medium-high heat over the flame alright while your sugar over there is over a medium-high heat we're going to get out our candy thermometer now we need the sugar to reach a temperature of 250 degrees now if you don't have one of these I'll show you a fun trick on how to know when your candy is at a certain stage but while that's over there we don't do any stirring because if you stir it you might get some sugar along the rim and then it starts to burn so leave it alone till it's 250 degrees now we're waiting for this to reach the hardball stage which is around 250 degrees it might take 20 minutes so be patient [Music] [Applause] all right guys this is very dangerous so be very careful the sugar is so so hot so my trick that I told you about if you don't have a candy thermometer it's just take a spoon get a little on the spoon and slip it in some water and if you drip it in water and it starts to get hard like candy you know it's done we go back you can feel it so now that I've got 250 degrees which is your hardball stage you're going to add 1/2 cup of your cinnamon candies yum to give it a little spice after you pour the cinnamon candies in there we're going to bring up the temperature to two hundred and eighty-five degrees all right now it's time to dip our apples in our sugar so I just let it kind of little the bubbles go down and you're just going to twirl it a little bit but be very careful you [Applause] turn it one or two times hey kind of smells like Christmas in here just let all the excess drizzle off that we're going to place it on our wax piece of paper [Music] other than the candied apple there's chocolate-covered apples or you can cover them in caramel and that's what we're going to show you I just poured a few caramel little cubes in this bowl I'm going to add two tablespoons of milk pop it into the microwave melt it and then dip our apples in the caramel it's going to be good and I'll show you how we do it okay time to just dip these apples in our caramel like we did with the candy kind and I put up some cute little slices as well for kids makes it a little bit easier just dip it in there [Music] once you've dipped it in the caramel this is a great time to add maybe some pecans or walnuts or little sprinkles right on top of there and then place it on the waxed paper [Music] whoo are handy that ball is all done I can actually see my reflection in this thing it's pretty crazy um let's try it I might hurt my teeth up [Music] this one might be poisoned and very crunchy [Music] but very soon many once you get through that really hard candy coating it's really good coupon for a party how do we know or something thumbs up you guys go try it favorite and like this video and I'll see you next week boom hi guys and welcome to cake top

Reza alternate between microwaving the chocolate for three seconds at a time and stirring it until chocolate is an 88 degrees Fahrenheit or 31 degrees Celsius or two degrees left for milk or white chocolate stir the chocolate until the temperature has dropped to 81 degrees Fahrenheit or 27 degrees Celsius and then add in the remaining four ounces of chocolate fold the tempered and non tempered chocolate together until they're uniformly melted if the chocolate dips below 81 degrees Fahrenheit you can use a hairdryer to bring the temperature back up check out Jacques terrorizes instructional video on tempering chocolate for more cool tips and advice once the chocolate is all melted together it's time to coat the brittle this is what it looks like when you temperature honest we let the brutal cool overnight and the next morning we packed it into bags to give to friends on Halloween stay tuned after the break we'll take a stab at some grown-up candy apples but not everything goes according to plan we'll from huntington new york i have a meta macaroni cheese I didn't like campbell's soup on macaroni goes in macaroni and cheese met nuclear cheese that comes with the craft box in heaven it's your macaroni cheese with every meal while we were kind of in the throes of our candy making craze in the second to last issue of Gourmet magazine had a recipe for sort of grown up candy apples made with red wine in the caramel it sounded kind of interesting let's make those to need eight small apples so I'm putting these chopsticks into the apples for holders I could use popsicle sticks or anything too but since we have takeout Chinese they have all these leftover chopsticks one and a half cups of red wines it's like a black first wine I've ever had oil the wine over medium heat until it's reduced to half a cup and then remove it from the heat then pour together two cups of sugar and half a cup of water in a heavy saucepan don't tell your dentist you're eating this stir the sugar and water together over medium heat when the caramel starts to boil swirl the pan occasionally is that the caramel color is evenly when it's a dark amber color add the wine and swirl the pan stir on six tablespoons of heavy cream and then simmer to 238 degrees Fahrenheit are 114 degrees Celsius then remove it from the heat and let it cool to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or 93 degrees Celsius dip the apples in the caramel swirl them so the caramel coach the apples evenly and hold them upside down for about 15 seconds to help the caramel set put the apples on greased wax paper or a greased Silpat until the caramel firms up I don't really know what happened but somehow these candy apples the caramel didn't stick and it melted off no good so I don't know what we did wrong if anybody else has tried this recipe please let us know help us I hope yeah tell us what we did wrong the failure of the candy apples was especially disheartening after the brittle came out so well and the great thing about the brittle is you could use any nut or seed or even dried fruit and be really delicious so the cost breakdown for the brittle was we use about a dollar fifty worth of corn syrup for pound of chocolate it was twelve dollars for a four pound pumpkin and its seeds it was a dollar sixty and then the sugar butter salt vanilla and baking soda was all Patrick so altogether that's fifteen dollars and ten cents and we made about ten bags so that's about a buck fifty back so the cost breakdown for the candy apples came to we used about two dollars worth of red wines who spent two dollars on the apples and two dollars on the cream I mean the only other ingredient was sugar and of course water which part of the pantry so altogether that was six dollars 48 candy apples which is less than a dollar per apple right because we use chopsticks that came with takeout Chinese that was a lot cheaper than buying Bob Wilson right so send us your recipe for a growing up candy or a caramel apple and whoever sends in the best recipe when a bag of our pumpkin seed brittle ",

        "content": "hi everybody I'm back and today I'm going to show you all how to make a caramel apple dump cake here's what you will need you will need caramel you will need cake mix any type of cake mix that you would like to use would be just fine I like to use yellow you will need apple pie filling so I've greased my baking dish that I have here let me grab my fork so I can get these beautiful apples out these this pie filling that I get from Kroger's I love so much and the reason why I love the kroger brand is because it's really sweet like a lot of times you can buy pie crusts I mean that pie crust pie filling and it's not sweet as you'd like it to be and sometimes I find myself having to put brown sugar in there is absolutely delicious and is perfectly sweetened so I'm gonna use two cans okay if you all haven't seen my peach cobbler dump cake video check it out because it's such a great video and that peach cobbler dump cake is so tasty you all hear me absolutely it is so we're gonna just kind of flatten it this way and make sure you use two cans because one can is just not enough unless you wanted to put like another fruit underneath it or something I know when I did my peach cobbler dump cake I put pineapples at the bottom and boy is it good okay so these are nice and flattened what I'm gonna do let me find my cinnamon and we're gonna put some cinnamon on I gotta have cinnamon on my apples absolutely I do and don't put too much just enough to coat the top it's just fine all right next let's put you some caramel in there oh my word as if apple dump cake wasn't enough as if it wasn't enough I have to taste that guys I'm getting started today guys oh my goodness kind of let the caramel go down inside of the apples and what flavor have we built here oh my

        "title": "How to Make Caramel Apples",
        "original_title": "Caramel Apple Pie Recipe",
        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hello everybody welcome back to another recipe today I'm going to show you how to make a caramel apple pie because it's nearly thanksgiving and everybody loves pies when it's Thanksgiving I know in Canada it was already thanksgiving but you can still have pie after thanksgiving anyway i'll show you what you need to sing what you gonna need to make the spy is going to be one recipe of my homemade caramel sauce which you can find on my channel two tablespoons of custard powder six tart apples i'm using Granny Smith a half a recipe of pie dough which you can watch me make in my pumpkin pie video but I'll come back to that later on and to make that apple crumble topping you are going to need one-third cups of butter unsalted butter cold one cup of flour a half a cup of brown sugar a half a cup of Picca nuts which we are going to chop up in a little bit and that's about it first thing we're gonna do is roll out our pie crust I made a homemade pie dough and I used a two and a half cups of flour and let me think two sticks of unsalted butter cold and a quarter cup of water a teaspoon of I'm sorry a half teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of sugar and you can watch me make this pie crust in my pumpkin pie video which i recommend you also take look at because pumpkin pie is very thanksgiving eve thing to make plus I make it with coconut milk so check it out maybe you'll enjoy it I'm just turning it as I rolled it out and I flowered my work surface okay now that I've rolled my pie crust out I am just going to put it into my pie dish which I have right here and drape it over and I am going to cut the excess of the edges I am just gonna fill it with some pie weights I have a bit of parchment paper that i'm going to put in the pie i just put in dried beans what i'm going to do now is I'm gonna put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes to get nice and cold and I have preheated my oven to 375 which is 190 degrees Celsius and i am going to be blind baking this pie shell and by the way you could have totally just bought a pie shell from the shop if they have it where you live and then that makes life a lot easier but we can't get it here and I like making my own so that's my explanation my pie crust was in the freezer for 10 minutes and and now I'm gonna put it in the oven or two groups my pie crust was in the oven for about 10 minutes with weights in and then I took the weights out of it and then I put it back in the oven for about five more minutes it's not really brown but it's cooked and that's what it's all about what I'm going to do next is peel some apples and slice them into thin slices now that my apples are all peeled and cut up I'm going to take my custard powder whoops and take a little bit and put it in the bottom of the pie crusts and I'm going to take the rest of it and I'm just going to put it with my apples and mix it around reason I did that is because app I can get quite wet because the the liquid comes out of the apples but the custard powder will sort of absorb the liquids and turn it into wall custard apple custard and I have my caramel sauce here I am NOT going to use all of this probably about a cup or a cup and a half of this so you can buy a store-bought caramel sauce as long as you have about a cup or jaw would probably be a cup and a half and then you can just use all that what I'm going to do now is I'm going to put layer of apples into my pie crust and then put some caramel sauce on but another layer of apples and caramel sauce another layer of apples and then some caramel sauce and then we're going to make the crumble topping I have all my ingredients ready to make my crumble I just chopped up my pecan nuts a little bit as you can see when you look at it and now i am going to put it in a bowl with the flour sugar and the butter now i am going to attempt to mix this all together okay so i decided to ditch the worst because it's hard with the whisk and i'm just doing it by hand i'm just making it crumble for the top and if you guys don't know what that means you should you should have sort of like a sandy texture with a bigger lumps of butter butter and flour in between and i thought i would show you it was time i showed you guys a recipe in which i did not use a mixer so people that don't have a mixer can make this full thanksgiving all for whatever other day whatever day you feel like enjoying apple pie okay that looks about done also stick it okay what I'm going to do now is I am just going to them all of this deliciousness on top of all of this deliciousness okay so i left my oven on 375 which is 190 degrees celsius and now i'm going to put the apple pie in for about 40 to 45 minutes I don't want my apples to go too soft because then it just turns into mush and nobody likes apple matched by so I'll show you what it looks like when it's ready my lovely amazing apple pie came out of the oven it looks so good I let it cool for about 40 minutes which is actually too short but i'm very impatient and i want to know what looks like and how it tastes and if the inside is wonderful looking as the outside so i'm going to cut the apple pie so we can see and have a taste it did pretty well in the first 10-15 seconds and then it sort of collapsed a little bit but that's purely because the apples are still a bit hot and I am way too impatient also the juices are running out a little bit but that's also because it's still too hot once it cools down the pectin from the apples or however the hell you pronounce that will set and then it'll be nice and sturdy sturdy okay so I'm gonna have a taste now because I can still taste see what it tastes like hmm I love the crunch from the crumble with the apples that aren't too soft and then they kind of take tots the apples are thoughts which is really weird word by the way but the caramel sauce is sweet and it's just a marriage of flavor it's amazing and you guys should totally make this for thanksgiving all just for any all day that you feel like having some nice warm apple pie so if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel and I'll see you guys next time in my next recipe holy if you guys like this video then please subscribe to my channel watch my other videos and stick around for the next video see you guys next time ",

        "content": "hey guys I'm Caroline Wright and I'm Alejandra Ramos and today we're making a peanut butter I like to make these after apple-picking in New York it's so fun to go with your friends and pick up a bunch of apples and then just make these camel apples it's one of the best things to do with them perfect treat and it's great to add the peanut butter it makes the caramel a little bit different and so I'm going to show you a pretty cool recipe today I'm excited awesome so first we're gonna start off by making this caramel I like to just add the sugar and this already starting to warm pan and add a little bit of water just to help the process so these started at all I'm gonna start together just right now just to get the water and the sugar together a little bit okay but you can see it's already starting to boil which is awesome so the process of this is just you know we're just cooking that sugar getting that to caramelize and brown and then we end up stopping it with the colds we have some cold cream over here stick these apples with our little popsicles yes absolutely so all I like to do is just go ahead and stick the stem end all right see if it can do this and you just pull a muscle oh yeah put your back into a girl let's do it there we go but how far in should they go just about yeah just enough to make them stable okay caramel and candy apples are my favorite thing to get from like street hair absolutely even though it's like such a decadent treat I have no problem walking absolutely so this is going pretty feverishly so like I said we're gonna add some cream and then we add the peanut butter at the end today we're using a little bit of just the smooth operator because we like to have just that clean flavor that delicious peanut butter thing it brings out the camel really really well yeah so actually you can see that it's already starting to turn color here it's because we have a our saucepan is super hot it's really really fast so as you can see we're just ready to pour this cream into this caramel already smells so nice yeah nutty so it's going to boil up just a little bit it's cold so what's happening is that it's causing the sugar to firm up around it but it's also it's like kitchen chemistry yes like a mad kitchen I'm holding off on the rest of the cream until it settles down just a little bit whoa awesome and you know I'm tilting the pan away from me because you know that's the worst sort of burn yeah over here let you handle that and then you know we're adding the peanut butter to so that also helps to cool it down quickly so I'm going to take this off the heat I can go ahead and turn this off actually and we're gonna add a generous amount of peanut butter because you know that's the way we like it or a Saturday yeah more peanut butter the better that's gonna make it nice and silky I'm gonna be perfect texture for getting onto these apples oh it already looks amazing you got to see it's so silky and gorgeous the peanut butter is really what makes it that beautiful texture here it's perfect smells like kind of looks like sugar peanut butter it makes it extra nutty and delicious I mean as delicious as it looks I know I need to not touch that so what we're gonna do is we're working fairly quickly I might just roll these apples in this caramel and then pass them to you just because I don't want to cross over you with no no worry it's a good act and I don't want to do that I'll be the net girl yes I'm a little nuts it's so good it's good to do this with a buddy though for exactly this reason yeah because you know Madoff turn you out of here for you so then once you roll them in the nuts just you can give it a little second for it to set up this makes them extra delicious it's sweet I will take over now so if you've ever made I've never made caramel apples I'm fine I'm miss an expert in buying and eating I see your Chi let other purchase a little handle the the making of them that's and you can probably have fun with the toppings - you like it oh yeah completely do other things candies or whatever other absolutely are you - probably even just do the caramel on its own oh absolutely I mean it's already got all this amazing peanut butter flavor and yes that's completely true but it's a doll so it's what I want to stress is it really does change the texture of the caramel it makes it extra silky it had adds that little something as a secret ingredient recipe so it's not that super super sticky and they're perfect for you know the fall bring them to your neighbors everyone will love you and actually these keep really well it'd be a great party favor - you can probably put a little plastic around them Oh completely you had like a fun fall party or brunch I like to refrigerate mine and they would refrigerate well for a couple of days and what we're doing in this prepare and sheet of parchment you could use you know greased wax paper or whatever else you have even a greased sheet would be fine it just makes for easier cleanup and as you can see actually as you work the caramel thickens a little bit - and that's okay that's why we're working pretty quickly and that we only have you know eight apples for this amount of caramel powdery warm it a little bit if it got too stiff yeah yeah you could rewarm it a little bit but it would be you know you would want to do it at a lower temperature if the point would be is not to change it drastically because then you'd end up with a different tips completely sure but yeah absolutely just warming a little bit work well to the ones that the pan keeps it nice and and free and as well there you have it peanut butter caramel apples let's give it a try boy I'm excited about this all right let's dive in it all right Cheers yeah like way to do this no definitely not thanks for watching we hope you try this recipe and give it a like every week we cook up a new peanut buttery dish so subscribe to our youtube channel so you don't miss a single one we love hearing from you guys so ask us questions or tell us your favorite ways to eat peanut butter in the comment section below we'll see you next time ",
