        "original_title": "How To Grow Pumpkins - Complete Guide",
        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "hello everybody today i'll be showing you how to grow successful pumpkin patch and how to have a good pumpkin yield i've been growing pumpkins for quite a while like seven or eight years and this is the best year i have done yet and i realized what the key things are to have pumpkin patch this year i have 17 pumpkins and that is a ton my record was eight so i will show you how to have a successful pumpkin patch like this in this video so come on guys i'll show you how to grow pumpkins so first off pumpkins are a rich um feeder and compost they love rich compost soils are full of nutrients many years before i did this year these pumpkins planted them along this row i never really amended the soil extra so i was wondering over the winter if that would help so i amended it with about three bags of compost and it is absolutely incredible absolutely it works compost is one of the key main factors that help pumpkins grow another thing that pumpkins need in order to grow is tons and tons and tons of sunshine so here as you see we planted them at the edge of the garden so they could vine out and catch all the sunshine sunshine they can and another thing is while when you're planting your pumpkins where to plant them in your garden never plant them deep in a garden because they find out so crazy i mean this vine right here is approaching 30 feet so don't plant it until they're in the middle of your garden because simply you will take over your garden and you'll have nothing else it will take up all the space and it'll just be pumpkins so plant at the edge of your garden and that's what i did this year and it's a success now here this year we have really really really hot summer and when i mean really hot i mean pretty much 90s every day every single day so and not a lot of rain so the soil dries up so quickly it becomes so parched it's so cracked that you gotta water it often almost i gotta water every other day and the thing is if you don't water them often enough see these weaves see this leaf how was how it has those veins this is a water pressure and as you if you ever didn't if you already grow pumpkins and you just wanted a girl know how to grow better pumpkins if you ever realized how during on some really hot days your leaves just wilt yes because that doesn't mean your plant is dying it just means that it's lacking water and it just needs watering because then the leaves go back up because it has more water to fulfill to refill the leaves so that's one key thing to water your pumpkins a lot of water i tend to give them twice the amount i think they need because they need that much now there are several problems that pumpkin growers will encounter and number one is this as you see these leaves have a powdery fungus on them and that's called powdery mildew just i don't know if you can see that but i have i'm sorry i have it on my hand and you could it's basically a fungus that forms on your pumpkin plants at the towards the end of the season as you see but it spreads spread like fire jesus this wasn't even here about a week ago so and now it's everywhere well not everywhere but almost on every leaf all signs of it so powdery mildew it won't damage your whole pumpkin patch won't kill it off but it will slow it down and uh the best way to avoid it and avoid the major effects of it is pretty much to plant them pumpkins in may and june because this comes towards the end of the season so plant them early and you will be fine another thing is that there's a moth that flies around it's called a vine door and vinegar and it lays eggs in your pumpkin plant all across your pumpkin plant and it rolls into this plant the larvae and makes it pretty much squishy and die but the good thing about the pumpkin is but the pumpkin is even more intelligent than this than this um than the bug i'm amazed by this yeah it's a root and roots and a pumpkin sends on roots at each set always one here one root here one right here and it keeps going like that because at the base it's all dead so what keeps the pumpkin pumpkin plant going is these little roots so that is important that your pumpkin is not growing like on the cement like that one so we could put the roots down into the ground and for the vine borer eggs the only way i found to deal with them is to pretty much pick off the eggs the only way i found that works now when it comes to planting the proper pumpkin variety there's not much to it if you want to make jack-o-lanterns out of your pumpkins plant jack-o'-lantern pumpkin or connecticut field if you want a a baking pumpkin the plant sugar pie pumpkin and you can make a pie out of the jack-o-lantern pumpkin but it'll be really liquidy and it won't be good now i've seen a lot of people on youtube have trouble recognizing the female from a male male has no bud at the bottom and will fall off don't get scared about that the female let me show you right here is the one that still will fall off but this is the one that has a pumpkin and as long as the pumpkin falls off doesn't fall off then you're good the flower will pull off even if it does get pollinated i'll make a a video on how to pollinate pumpkins and but that will be a separate video so stay tuned for that i ran out of time to film my proper outro so thanks for watching catch you guys later see ya bye ",

        "content": "hey everyone it's November 4th I thought I'd show you pumpkins that I ended up with this season I didn't plant them I didn't plant them on purpose so they were on the compost heap and the vine started growing and without any effort just only everybody have to put in is be careful not to step on the vine because it it takes over the whole yard but I ended up with some pumpkins and as a jack-o'-lantern that I cut up for Halloween I guess you could say I'm a traditionalist with the basic carving there and ended up with some extra candy overestimated again and on how that happened but you know I was talking to my brother and he said oh he cut him up and give him to his chickens and then jokingly said why don't you make some pumpkin seeds and uh I used to love pumpkin seeds I couldn't get enough of them so I went online found out basic recipe on preparing pumpkin seeds and gave it a shot and couldn't stop eating them so I thought I'd show you how to make pumpkin seeds again and you know I gave it a little bit more thought and there's a lot of people for most people on this planet they don't grow stuff as a hobby or a novelty they grow stuff because they need to eat so instead of having these end up on the compost heap I thought I'd give it a try and learn how to prepare some pumpkins maybe make I like pumpkin pie and make some pumpkin pie prepare some pumpkin puree not puree and I guess you can make pumpkin soup too so I'm going to give that a try so let's take a look at though I got our lake pumpkin that like this evidently the vine just keeps on growing as it grows along and keeps on putting in roots and I get this other pumpkin that looks like it's going to be about well 5060 pounds let's take a look at it but maybe not looks like it's rotting we had a frost so to my surprise critters like to nibble on pumpkins too so I had to put this netting over it and you can see I guess the vine has that frosted finish off the vine here but these pumpkins when they start to rot they rot pretty fast there's the remnants of one right here so it just goes back into the garden and maybe some critters get to have a free meal I didn't notice I thought I protected it but it looks like that that damage there was enough to break the integrity here I mean the rest of its solid so oh well let's get on to carve and open up a pumpkin and now I don't know what variety these pumpkins are there a generic probably pumpkin that's grown best for you know making Halloween pumpkins I don't necessarily think they're probably a good variety or the best variety for eating but the seeds they're pretty good but when I read the smaller pumpkins that's what you use for making pumpkin pie as they get larger they can get I guess grainy so we'll carve this we'll cut this one open and get the seeds out of this I just use an ice cream scoop to clean it out nice dirty spoon to would help so what you do with these is you clean you clean off these seeds in water just clean them off with your hands in between your hands with rub them so all this debris comes off of them and then basically just boil them in some salted water put them in a you know preheat the oven to 400 degrees and then you boil them in the salted water for about 10 minutes and then you roast them from anywhere 10 to 20 minutes until they're brown to the way you like them and you don't have to just use salt I guess you can use honey you can use the spite different spices savory sweet maybe make them hot might try those variations too I mean even though I didn't put any effort into growing these there's no need to just throw them on the compost pile as we get some of this looks like this one here this one actually a seat is actually sprouted inside the pumpkin that's interesting so I got about a cup pumpkin seeds that's about the amount that I got out of the first pumpkin that I cut up so let's go ahead and make some salted pumpkin seeds so I have about a cup of pumpkin seeds here washing water get all the slimy stuff off of the pumpkin see it's them a couple of times and then strain I have the oven preheated for preheating to 400 degrees and we're going to boil some water breathily season some water bring it to a boil then turn it down let it simmer for about 10 minutes and we want to use about 2 cups of water for every 1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds that we have and then to that you can put about 1/2 a tbsp for a cup of water that's what I did with the first batch and I think I like a little bit more saltier so I'm going to try a little bit more salt I know you know the ones that buy in the store there those are really salty they're so they're not they're not as salty as those but you know season them to your taste to your preference so I have about a cup of pumpkin seeds so I'm putting in four cups of water and I've got four tablespoons of kosher salt I'm putting in and my pumpkin seeds I'm going to bring that to a boil and over the temperature let it simmer for about ten minutes so they've been simmering for about ten minutes as you can see they brown up a little bit but when you bake them they turn white again so let's take these strain them try to put them on a sheet put them on a sheet pan try to get themselves you know about just a single layer of spread them out evenly they put some foil in this sheet pan and put a tablespoon of olive oil coated the bottom so to spread these out a nice single way you can see how they darkened up sort of like a tan color or brown so again we're putting them in a 400-degree oven and want to bake them for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes depending on your preference of how brown and crispy you want them then they go so it's been 10 minutes let's take a look they look done see they've lightened up again let them cool off and you and you have yourself some nice pumpkin seeds so here you go salted baked pumpkin seeds pretty good I might try some different spices and read online perhaps you could you know cook them with honey so they come out sweet I know it may be maybe they taste good with cinnamon on them never know what the old standard salted pumpkin seeds are pretty good on their own so if you get around to growing pumpkins in it next season or you have any pumpkin sit around from this season give it a try and thanks for watching my videos ",

        "content": "hi it's Lori never meant from common sense homesteading and today I'm going to teach you how to cook a pumpkin and I'd like to dedicate this video to my friend Eric who messaged me earlier this week asking how to do exactly that so here we have an assortment of winter squash and pumpkin they're all the same species but just different varieties so they can pretty much be used interchangeably your recipes when I'm baking and cooking I generally prefer to use most the other winter squash varieties over a typical pie pumpkin and I'll get to that in a minute and show you why but they're all baked pretty much the same so I'm going to set this one aside and I'm going to butcher these two so that you can see what's going on here so let me see so in the garden fresh vegetable cookbook andrea chessmen says that you may have a tough time getting into some of your bigger winter squash because her skins are so tough and she actually talks about taking them outside and dropping them on concrete or microwaving them for a couple minutes letting them rest and then taking a cut because the skins are so tough but pumpkins tend to be that's one of their saving graces and they do tend to be pretty easy to cut through so if you take a look at the inside of your typical pie pumpkin you know it has a fairly thin ring of flesh and then your seed cavity and to bake this I'm going to clean out all the seeds and goobers inside and then set that down I've got a broiler pan and I'm going to set that down on the broiler pan cut side down put it in a 350 degree oven and bake that for about 45 minutes to an hour until you can poke the foot of the skin easily with the fork so next up I'm going to butcher the winter squash now a lot of winter squash tend to have tougher skin so I actually pre-cut this a little bit so I didn't end up snapping myself on camera I believe this is a gern Dale and it actually splits really which makes it a little easier to bust into now if you look at grab that one you see if I can get these pointing to the camera nicely now if you look at the flesh color of the pie punkin versus the winter squash the Jarnail winter squash you can see that the flesh and the winter squash is darker and it tends to be denser you can't really see that to all the camera and it's a little bit thicker along that bottom edge where as opposed to the pumpkin where you've got a pretty thin run of ring of flesh all the way around the pumpkin so I really generally prefer using winter squash for baking because the fruit is sweeter and richer and less watery so you don't end up with watery pies and fillings and you don't have to use as much sugar okay so next up we're going to clean out the seeds and get them ready to go in the oven again this will cook in the oven on a pan cut side down about an inch of water for 45 minutes to an hour at 350 degrees so here we go gonna do some goober scooping and generally it's not too tough to get these seeds out of here if you've got a grapefruit spoon that can help because of course it's got that serrated edge that digs into the flesh just a little bit and helps get that loose but I just have a regular big honkin serving spoon that I'm using here scoop those aside of course you can so we've got clean pumpkin and set that down and then if you want you can clean up the seeds and remove the stringy bits the connective tissue and soak them in salt water drain them and roast them to make roasted pumpkin seeds usually ours go to the chickens or the duckies because they like these ones that still have holes more than I do but we actually grow holus pumpkin seeds that we like for pepitas much better I'll probably cover those in another video if you would like leave a comment and let me know alright SIA number 2 pan ready one thing about the winter squash is they can be just a little bit tougher to clean out but because they're a little bit sturdier on the inside oh yeah that's nice I don't stop buying everywhere the interest of keeping this brief and a scooped quick and a little bit messy almost done and it doesn't matter if there's a few little blue strings hanging no big deal alright so we have site number one face down my baking sheet side now once you get your pumpkin cooked or your squash cooked you want to take that out of the oven and let it cool until you can handle it and then you scoop these soft and flesh out of the skin and compost that or feed it to your critters and typically before I use it in recipes I do like to puree my squash or pumpkin you know run it through the blender or food processor a little bit because sometimes there will be chunks depending on the variety and how well it's cooked so that just helps give your finished finished baked goods like your pumpkin pies or muffins or pancakes or whatever a little smoother consistency if you don't mind a few Chunkin Chunkin loves yeah oh good junk then you don't have to puree you can just mash it with the pork and use it in your recipe so number two and that I will get these in the oven I will add my water right closest so you're not running across your kitchen with a big pan full of water so I'll set these on my stovetop dump the water in and then load them into the oven all right so I'm gonna pour some water into the bottom of the pan and you know somewhere around 1/2 an inch an inch this is tilted a little bit you just don't want it to bake dry while it's in the oven because then the sugars of the pumpkin can easily scorch and bird so keep an eye on it if you go if you have a shallower pan and can't put a full inch of water just check it about midway through baking so that it doesn't look dry hon carefully slide it in yeah that's all there is to it and always set the timer and check on it in about 45 minutes all right so here we are we have the pie pumpkin on the left and the gern Dale squash on the right and I see this is fork tender the tort fork goes in easily I'm gonna flip these over so you can compare you don't want to go the right direction right if we can get these slit around I'm gonna have to wash my hot pads man all right so we have pumpkin and squash you can see that's a lot darker and it also tends to be a lot sweeter now to prep this for making your pumpkin pies now normally I'd let this cool off a little bit but I'm on a bit of a tight schedule here and we want to get this demonstrated so cool ooh this is gonna be fun my husband says I have to do this so people can see when it's like the scoop the flesh of the pumpkin so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this side you can see it's plenty done it's plenty tender you just scrape that away from the skin and you know basically you don't want to punch through the skin but everything up to that is perfectly edible and so I'm gonna take this and put that in the blender and hit frappe and that is all you have to do to make your own homemade pumpkin puree ",

        "content": "we're here with a staff scientist Steve Smith at the sign to North garden and can you tell me a little bit about this garden first of all sure absolutely so science North grow is a garden and it has multiple purposes one of the main reasons that we grow a garden are for our animals so that we can feed the animals at science North on the third floor in our northern ecosystems so we grow things like lettuce beans peas giant pumpkins which some of our animals actually like the giant pumpkin and the blooms they'll eat them it's nice for our food stuff to come out and pick fresh stuff daily and then use it in our elements food court and they're proud of it because they have a big sign down there that says that this food has been growing at in the science north garden so it's kind of neat that's great and today we're here to learn a little more about the science of growing a giant pumpkin well I've got giant pumpkins at home in my own garden and I've got a giant pumpkin and that is double the size of this giant pumpkin here right now it's it's maturing a lot it's starting to turn orange now and the orange is the the pigments that are being expressed in the pumpkin so these orange pigments are what give the pumpkin its colors and it depends on the number the amount of pigments in the pumpkin that will give it its orange color this pumpkin is still white you can see that biologically yeah yeah it will so we're looking in the next ten days to two weeks you're gonna look you're gonna see some major major changes in this pumpkin well they they grow at certain rates throughout the season but they can grow up to 30 pounds per day yeah so right now at this point the giant pumpkin that's just to my right here it grew actually twelve point six one pounds overnight so overnight in September this time of the year is is pretty amazing I've got two giant pumpkins in the patch this year two different plants I'm growing one giant pumpkin on each plant and there's a reason for that a science you want to conserve all the energy into one fruit because you're maximizing the capacity of the energy the food photosynthesis and all these leaf surfaces which provide the energy for the food and the water you want to be able to get it all into just one fruit to really pack on the way part of the reason why I'm growing the giant pumpkins is that there they are the largest food on the planet and they're amazing to see but I also am encouraging people to grow giant pumpkins in Northern Ontario and hope that more people will take it on and so in terms of growing giant pumpkins I'm gonna give a couple really good pieces of advice they do take a lot of time and care in terms of managing the vine and caring for the giant pumpkins because I had said earlier that they do have a primary vine and then secondary vines off of that so you want to make sure that you're trimming the vines and managing them so that at the end of the at the end of the season you've got this beautiful plant that then can take all that energy and put it into the fruit the other factor is that they do take in a lot of water they drink a lot of water they like water and so don't underestimate how much water a giant pumpkin will take they will so anybody can grow giant pumpkins absolutely and don't underestimate your ability to grow something everyone can learn and anybody can grow giant pumpkins weekend at the Fall Fair you're going to see a few pumpkins you're gonna see giant pumpkins you're gonna see pumpkins of different shapes and sizes the tiniest pumpkin the largest pumpkin so it should be fun for more giant pumpkins you can see them this weekend at the Anderson Fall Fair and the morning north in science north pumpkins will be on display at dynamic earth for their Halloween event for northern life dot CA I'm Malcolm Villegas ",

        "content": "hey hey what's going on guys as you guys know I am true true today I'm happy to bring you guys on another minecraft PlayStation 3 tutorial I'm gonna be showing you guys how you guys can grow your own pumpkins and make them and I you guys can do some silly things like I on you and put it on top of your head or you can use it as decorations as well whatever you choose so anyways well this is so dark in here I'm gonna take this off give me a second and put that pumpkin right put it right here oh I already have a chest filled everything you really need um I have a empty bucket just in case I got some bone meal to speed things up water I have a diamond pickaxe I'm at I'm at home as well as pumpkin seeds I mean of course you don't need diamond tools you just need like wooden or stone or iron tools anything like that will work it you really don't even need bone meal I just do that just so we can speed things up also a shovel would probably be nice for you as well but basically I mean again just see how this grew one right here basically what you need the general formation of it it's kind of like a cross and the reason why you want to have a cross is you never know where the pumpkin is going to grow let's look at that one just grew so let's go quick make one I'm gonna quick fix in the dirt here and basically what you want to do is you want to keep a cross formation and I like to have like two squares for the water and firmly for if you can I'm able to help a lot although you don't really have to I had personally believe it in working better so I was going this and then I'm gonna do this I'm going a quick form for you as you can see two more like this and then I'll do this as whoops whatever doesn't really matter doesn't really matter too much in that part and then I'm going to grab this all right it's good enough it's kind of like a sloppy farm of course if you're trying to go for some more decorations I don't recommend you guys do it like this just make it a little more neat and yeah some quick fix this and then here we go and then what you want to do is you want to put water and in order to have infinite water you want to put it on you wants to put the bucket of water on both sides and probably should have had another  water but I'm actually gonna steal some water from over here and pour it over here so yeah that's how you pretty much do it you just want to put water on both corners I'm kind of stealing the water sorry about that there we go perfect and then put it on this side as well got some more water put it over here perfect grab some more water put it over here got some more water on the other side and I mean of course if you really want it to be a little more neater I mean you would have planned this a lot better obviously I'm just kind of going on a whim here well kind of like float all the way around sweet awesome cool Coolio put on if you guys do this little trick you're gonna have infinite water you guys can do whatever you want with it you can keep your feeling your bucket of water I could have I could've just pulled water from here if I really wanted to however now we are done with the general layouts for the for the water now what you want to do is wanna get your hoe and just go down the whole area around it hold down the axes and then what you want to do then kind of eat you know I can't reach the far one no all right now you have it hold now you wanna put the pumpkin seed in the middle and then you're gonna wait for it to grow obviously it's gonna be a little bit however I like to speed things up I'm gonna put the bone meal in here you go oh no no no no no no pumpkin see where'd you go there you go bone meal follow me a work there you go finally bonemeal finally worked alright perfect so now now I got that to Gil and um I have the cross cat the great shape got the water good we are good to go now all we have to do is wait a little bit meanwhile while we're waiting I'm quick chopped down on these these guys and I'm not quick how some more here we go gonna hold this guy pick up this nice and his pumpkin I should say I'm also if you guys didn't know if you guys want to do other stuff you guys want me to view some more tutorials on different like plants how to grow different plants I can do that as well I'm a little it's pretty quite simple and quite easy how to do it it's kind of like self-explanatory just put it by water and eventually it's going to grow well so while I am waiting look at this what come on come on now don't be silly don't be ridiculous um no we just got to wait a little bit it's gonna be a little bit that's one thing that's kind of a shame about Minecraft it's not really a shame I guess it's more realistic I suppose that you have to wait for stuff to grow it's kind of like Farmville together I play that but voila we have our first pumpkin congratulations guys take take a picture take a picture of this Instagram it tweet it do whatever you have to do to get this this is true trees is the first tutorial pumpkin that we made in the video awesome really cool it was another one cool take a two pictures do that take a picture of me tweet it at me and I'll try to write tweet it anyways then we want to do for me a little more fasting chop it down with your axe we're gonna do it with your hand and it should work and then redo the hoe and their yacht it so that's how you make pumpkins I'm gonna put them all over here so you guys can see them perfect perfect perfect and I'm gonna stand right here so you guys can you guys can look at them so that's what I got for you guys I hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial pumpkins aren't really a useful really unless you want to wear them on your head or use them as decorations in your world but overall they're pretty fun to do and it's pretty easy to make so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this video take a minute uh-huh use this diamond axe and smack it with the like button or you know what I never get the opportunity to do this use the hoe use this hoe and smack the hoe with the like button anyway so you guys enjoyed the video I'll catch you guys later stay true pace ",

        "content": "so today we're going to be planting pumpkin seeds in my garden I've had them right here in my windows for the past week and they've started to sprout so we're gonna get them in the ground let's go ahead and take a look at them so I have two different varieties here this one is more of a jack-o'-lantern pumpkin and then this one is more of a pie pumpkin okay so let's go ahead and take a look at these seeds and see how they're doing so I'm going to open up the jack-o'-lantern pumpkin seeds and see how they look so that's how they're looking in there looking pretty good so this is only after about a week of being inside these baggies they're moistened paper towels in here and then we put it in my window and so these did really good I think six seats I put six of them in here and out of this six almost all of them sprouted except for this one guy that's okay though and now we're gonna take a look at this one it's called triple treat pumpkin so it's more of a smaller sweeter pie pumpkin and we're gonna see how these guys did so exact same thing I put them in paper towel in the baggie and they've been in my window for the past weeks so let's take a look at these ones so as you can see these are kind of some older seeds only one of them actually really sprout all a couple of them did sprout but we've got a lot of mold going on in here and these were exact same method as my jack oh man Canon's and he didn't have any mold with those seeds so I'm gonna go ahead and assume that this was just a bad batch of seeds so I probably won't be planning a majority of these are probably a lot older I am gonna go ahead and plant this one though because it's looking really good that's like a good one okay so I'll see you guys out in the garden so we're out here now in my backyard garden so this is kind of more tomato and herb area and then right over here is the area that I've gone ahead and prepared for the pumpkins today pumpkins do need a lot of space when they're growing they get to be very big but I don't have a very big backyard so I'm just gonna try to make it work with this space so we're just going to be putting some miracle-gro garden soil down and then we'll get those pumpkin seeds planted I'm gonna go ahead and put this first bag of soil down so what I'm planning on doing is just covering the whole area with this and then I'm gonna plant four of the seeds so I'm gonna do four little bounce so I'm gonna go ahead and get this down okay so we just got about one bag of soil down we completely covered off this whole area with it looks pretty good so next I'm just gonna go ahead and make those four mounds the pumpkin seeds are gonna go to it alright so now I'm going to go ahead and make the mounds that the pumpkin seeds are gonna go in I'm just gonna kind of do one two and then three four behind me so that's looking like a pretty good size to me it'll give my pumpkin seed some room to kind of root out so I'm just gonna go ahead and make okay so I've got all four of my mountains made now so you look like a pretty good size to be for each seed up so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use three of my choco Manor disease and then one of the pie seeds there's only one of those really sprouted so I'm just gonna go ahead and open up the bag and I'm gonna dig a little hole in the first round with my finger soils feeling nice and warm and then I'm just going to take one of my seeds carefully you don't want to accidentally rip the root okay so I finally caught most of this guy loose he just his roots really took off and he became quite a monster so he became one with the paper towel in a way so I've almost got him free it's fine that I'm putting some of the paper towel in the ground because that will just compost back into the soil I'm not too worried about that I just really wanted to make sure that I didn't rip any of his roots that he worked so hard to grow so I'm going to go ahead and plant him with this beginning chute at the top and we're just gonna cover him up with some soil and then that fit so I've got my first batch of pumpkin seeds planted this is my first time doing this so we'll see how it goes if you guys have any tips or if you've done this before I'm growing in the Southern California area I'm in the San Diego area so if you have any tips or pointers and you've done this before with pumpkins just leave me a comment and let me know alright thanks for watching ",

        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "in this video I'm gonna show you how to grow pumpkins from seeds for Halloween if you want to grow your own pumpkins then you should be thinking about it in the spring pumpkin is a very tender vegetable the seeds do not germinate in cold soil and the seedlings are injured by frost so do not plant until all danger of frost is passed and the soil is thoroughly warmed up May is the ideal time if you don't you'll be faced with disappointment of picking your pumpkin from the supermarket shelves instead it's a shame that these magnificent autumn vegetables are so easily forgotten because growing a pumpkin is great fun for all the family especially for Halloween there's a pumpkin to suit every home at Halloween from the tiny pumpkin to the enormous pumpkin but before you begin growing giant pumpkins it's wise to think about how much space you have to spare if you prefer traditional size pumpkins then it's a perfect choice for carving and making pumpkin pies for something slightly different why not try a small attractive variety pumpkin the green and orange pattern fruits they are the perfect size for popping in the microwave so when do so pumpkins pumpkins require warm daytime temperatures of between eighteen and thirty degrees Celsius at 68 degrees Fahrenheit and prefer a minimum nighttime temperature of 16 degrees Celsius at 61 degrees Fahrenheit at least until they're planted 8 in cooler areas pumpkins can be sown outdoors from April to mid-may for transplanting outside later on when temperatures have risen however if so in space is at a premium then you may prefer to wait until the soil is warmed up in late May in early June and then so directly in Scituate doors whether you choose to start them in pots or in the garden it's best to sow two seeds per hole and then thin out the weakest plants later on if you are direct so in pumpkins outdoors start them off under cloak shoes to give them the best start so how'd you grow a pumpkin so the step is to sell pumpkin seeds on their side in a small seven and a half centimeter that's three inch pot of seed compost in a depth of about 2.5 centimeters that's a been inch step to place them in a propagator or seal the pots inside a plastic bag at a temperature of about 20 Celsius that's 68 degrees Fahrenheit until germination which takes about five to seven days step 3 once germinated grow the pumpkin plant on for about 4 weeks until they are large enough to be transplanted outdoors step 4 gradually acclimatized them to outdoor conditions over seven to ten days before transplanting pumpkins into warm well-drained humors rich soil in full Sun with shelter from winds choose a spot that receives at least six hours of direct Sun per day and prepare the soil in advance adding plenty of well rotted manure or compost step 5 planting distances can range from 90 centimeters apart to 3 metres apart depending on the variety so you will need to check the seed packet at each planting station pile the soil into mains about 15 centimetres high that's about 6 inches plant each pumpkin plant on top of the mound to ensure good drainage and keep them well watered until they established step 6 pumpkins enjoy plenty of nitrogen so they will appreciate a feed of general fertilizer a few weeks after planting they will begin to produce long stems which can be trained in a circle around the plant to prevent them spreading too far they have deep roots in a normally quite capable of finding their own water within the soil but in very dry periods some supplementary watering may be required so how'd you pollinate pumpkins pumpkins are normally insect pollinated but if the fruits are not setting then you may need to hand pollinate them female pumpkin flowers can be identified by a swollen bump at the base of the bloom which male flowers don't have so you can easily tell don't be alarmed if the first few flowers are all male this is normal and you will start to find female flowers developing soon after is the flowers develop pick a single male flower and remove its petals press it against the center of each female flower if you prefer you can tickle the center of each flower with a small paintbrush to transfer the pollen from the male flower if you're growing pumpkins for Halloween then you will be hoping for the largest fruits possible select just two or three pumpkins per plant and remove all others to focus the plants energy on your chosen fruit so how do you harvest pumpkins leave your pumpkins on the plant for as long as possible till the skin is hardened and the fruit start to crack near the stem be sure to harvest them before the first frost though cut each fruit from the stem leaving several inches of the stem attached so here is my best pumpkin growing tips pumpkins can be prone to rotten if they're sitting on wet grained if necessary you can raise the fruits off the ground using a wooden board or a large upturned seed tray when growing pumpkins you can help the fruits to ripen but remove in any foliage that is shading them in cool seasons you may need to harvest pumpkins in a few weeks before Halloween and bring them into a warm room to help them ripen in time so how do we use pumpkins well they can be used as table decorations place them on some colorful autumn leaves that you've collected or if you're really creative make some play settings with them for your party dinner guests you can also make Halloween carvings small pumpkins can look very effective and are easier for young children to handle there are lots of free templates on the internet from simple to more elaborate designs to really impress your neighbors you can also make soup balls out of them pumpkin soup is delicious and looks really effective presented in hollowed-out pumpkins simply scoop out the flesh making sure that the bowl is sturdy enough to hold the soup you'll find some great these on the internet for creating pumpkin and butternut squash soups finally the pumpkin seeds don't throw away after the carving pumpkin seeds are edible simply scoop them out wash them and dry the seeds sprinkle them with oil salt and pepper and roast them you can use them for a garnish on salads and soups or just eat them as a tasty snack I hope you've enjoyed this video on how to grow pumpkins for Halloween if you have please give this

        "content": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be making a Halloween DIY and it's gonna be pretty neat I found this idea just yesterday on Pinterest and I had never seen it before and what it's called it's a Halloween diorama is what it looks like so the one on the picture that I found is white and it has like a white light in it and it has a little tree with a skeleton and what it basically is is it's it's kind of like the fairy garden that I made a couple videos ago but this time you're gonna be doing it inside of a pumpkin and at first I didn't know that the stores word is selling like the pumpkin with the hole already made I thought I would have to buy a plastic pumpkin and actually make the circle in my own but luckily Hobby Lobby does sell the ones already with the hole already made and I'll go ahead and show you guys in a minute but practically you just get the same kind of stuff but obviously Halloween themed so you get like a little miniature stuff like pumpkins and bats whatever you want to include like skeletons and you just throw it in there and make a little landscape and I think it's a really good idea because you can use it every year since you're not using a real pumpkin so I think it's just a really neat idea and I think it's gonna be something that I'm gonna enjoy because I actually did enjoy making the fairy garden a lot and I still have it back there so after this I'm probably gonna switch to a little pumpkin cuz I think you'll be cool to have it out for the rest of this month yeah we can go ahead and get started so I think this is probably going to be one of my favorites okay so I'm gonna go over the stuff that I got at the store and of course the first thing that I'm going to show you guys is the hollow pumpkin so as you can see the holes already made and it's plastic and it's pretty realistic looking and I was just really surprised that they were already selling these for that purpose it was a little more than the regular pumpkins but it's like I said it's worth it because it's gonna be like a decoration that you can use over and over again every year so I got this one they didn't have any other colors so I went with the orange one and then I got a black piece of paper and then I got the moss I went with moss that was this color so it's like the white color I went with some little bats and some pumpkins and this is the same kind that I got for my fairy garden but these were little pumpkins that they were selling so of course I have to go with that and then for the trees like I said you can use branches from your trees outside so I just wanted a walk and I picked up some branches so I can either do two separate ones so I can just glue these together and make it a one tree so I'll see when I come up with but I thought these were pretty good size for the inside of the pumpkin nice thing is the fairy light and these are the same kind that I have for the fairy garden I'm going to go ahead and get started with this you can easily just fit this over here like this and I'm just finishing it in the middle so kind of like that where it's all dark and you really can't see because if you're looking at looking at it straight on you're just gonna see the black all right so now I have to figure out where the fairy lights are gonna go so I'm gonna go ahead and get these out so they're on I kind of want this to be like the Stars if that makes sense so poke a hole over here kind of what there's already one area and it's pretty easy so you just goes right through and then I'm going to put the lights through here [Music] so do you just go a little bit and then just push in the wire I'm going to go ahead and measure the little sticks to see if they'll fit in there here's what the trees look like so far and they look pretty good again I'll give you guys a better idea what this looks like once it's all glued and stuff because right now it's kind of hard to see based on where it's located and how I'm working in a very small space in there but so far this is what it looks like I'm letting the trees kind of sit in there because I put hot glue so I'm gonna give it a couple minutes and then I'll start with the little decorations right so now we are ready to put in the little bats so there are tiny little bats and I was thinking I could glue them to the little branches this is what the end result looks like and I think it looks really really cute alright this is the end of the video and I obviously really liked the way it turned out it's gonna be really good to have them out there in my house with my decorations for the rest of this season and it was actually really easy I think that everybody can really do this and you can really get creative if I would have had more time I probably would have made little goals on the paper and probably would've just stuck through the fairy lights to make it look more like this sky or like stars but I just wanted to include it and then just pan it over the glue and I don't mind that you can see a little with that because from far away you really can't tell I'm so glad I found the pin I had some other stuff in mind I want to try I'm definitely something with pumpkins and maybe carving them or either painting them I did find some really good idea the other day so yeah if you guys like this video please gonna like and subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye ",

        "content": "hi there miss Ella here from learn to grow I hope they're you having a great day it's almost fall now today I'm going to show you how to tell when to harvest your pumpkins there are five different ways and these are pretty simple things that probably most of you know already so we're going to go out in the garden and show you upon harvest we will be curing these pumpkins for 10 to 14 days you can if you have a greenhouse you can face in your greenhouse or just keeping out of the rain some where it's dry where it gets enough Sun or even inside your kitchen by the window where it gets enough sunlight the reason why we cure the pumpkins is to harden the rind or the skin it is caring the starch is inside in the sugars will sweeten in time and also the curing process will preserve your pumpkins to last longer between 3 to 6 months and you want to store them after curing in a dry place where ventilate well ventilated area if you have a barn I'm going to store mine right by the porch I have a shelf there and I'm going to putting them either on top of some strong or even maybe a cardboard so you want to make sure you send them down where it is a porous surface that way it's got it gets air on the bottom of your pumpkins so it won't go rotten so but anyway so let's go in the garden and I hope that you find this tip helpful have a great day guys and happy gardening my daughter sunflower garden so the sunflowers did really well they're pretty tall they're least I think about maybe 7 8 feet tall not as tall as the ones up front I wouldn't space them out as far but they are just so beautiful and just want to share that with you guys were quick the first thing of course is when the leaves die down and they wilt so they when they dry up this is also a sign that your pumpkins are ready to be harvested now my the leaves of my pumpkins dried prematurely because it caught the party mildew so they all wilted and they kind of start dying pretty early but anyway so one obvious thing is the color of the pumpkins so it's evenly orange and that's obviously is a sign that it's right another thing you can do is you can kind of tap on it lightly and if it sounds Hollow which it does that's another way to tell if it's right another one is you want to make sure that the skin is hard and you can do this by testing with your thumbnail you can push it down and if it does not puncture through the skin and it just ends it but pops back up that means it's hard enough and it's right and one more thing here is when the stem right here is hard and sometimes they'll start cracking so that's another way to tell if your pumpkins are ready and when you're harvesting your pumpkins you want to make sure that you cut the stem a few inches away from the fruit that way it'll dry up and heal naturally and in case if the stem gets a rot it will not spread it to the pumpkin I'll be far enough away they'll dry naturally the orange ones are pretty much ready and ripe so when I'm curing these ones here I'm going to have to flip this over that way that it'll get Sun on the other side of the pumpkin in the color will even now in ventually turn orange but anyways we had a good harvest not bad I wish we had more but you know that's okay that's grateful that we got a nice pie here well you do like what the voice exercise good nice very good guys then when you stand up yep ",

        "content": "hey everybody today I'm tech with Brett we're gonna show you how to carve a pumpkin don't worry there will be tech involved the first step is you need to find a nice round pumpkin as a flat face also you need to make sure that has a flat bottom so it sits up great and has a stem so that you can easily pull it off so the second step is to go in to Google and search for a pumpkin stencil and you can search for whatever you want and you will most likely find what you're looking for so here this first which is actually what we want and I want this one that just has the outline so I'm not going to waste any ink printing off a picture with all those dark colors so I'm going to open this up and if you hit the settings right here you can go to view original image and then I just want to save that image and now that it is downloaded I'm going to open up a write on my phone and I am going to hit the print samsung print service from my phone depending on what printer you have it may be different and I'm going to choose my HP printer here and I want it full size but we can just go in here and make sure that it is covering up the full page and then I hit print the first step is to remove the top of the pumpkin you can use any knife to cut make sure it's sharp and easy to get into the pumpkin I do prefer the knife that I had as a kid that was in the pumpkin carving kit that we had once you go all the way around if it won't remove try going back around the opposite direction to remove the top then you can cut off the guts of the pumpkin from the top so that you have a nice clean cut there and then the next step is to get a ice-cream scoop or a big spoon and scrape out the insides this will get rid of all the string and pumpkin-seeds easily from the inside of the pumpkin then make sure you have a bowl to place it in so that you don't have a great big mess I usually do this a few times checking to make sure I make it clean and smooth so that there's not any dangling string in the carved pumpkin I ended up having to print out a smaller version of the witch so that it would fit more properly on the pumpkin then I'm going to find the best place to put it and I'm actually just going to pin this right on the outside of the pumpkin I am gonna take a fifth pin and then poke small holes along the outside of my pattern this way it's easy to see once I remove the pattern and I can distinguish what I need to cut out the black pieces are exactly what I want to remove so then I take off the paper and I mark the pattern that I need to follow to cut out this way I don't cut out a piece that is needed to show the shape of my pattern once I go through and mark the outline I then want to make sure that I make a mark with it will show exactly what needs to be cut out and leave blank what needs to stay once I fully trace the pattern then I am ready to begin carving out the pumpkin make sure that when you cut into the pumpkin you cut it straight in and not at an angle this allows the full shape to appear once the pumpkin is illuminated with light when you are carving you want to make sure that you start with the delicate areas first so that the pumpkin is firm and then move to the easier portions near the end once I've completely cut out all objects and I'm going to go through and clean up to make sure that all strings or areas are cut out properly the last part is to put your pumpkin back together place a candle inside and light the candle to enjoy your fine work thank you all for joining me today on tech with Brett if this helped you carve a pumpkin I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments if you want to see more how-to tech videos please click my face in the top right hand corner to subscribe and I hope you all have a safe Halloween ",

the video in the description box below but for this week the focus is pumpkins and I came across a recipe for a pumpkin muffin it's a streusel topped pumpkin muffin with a cheesecake filling it looks really good haven't made it before but I do like to kind of make it on film with you guys and you can see how the end product is together before I do that video though I figured I'd show you how I prepare the pumpkins because I am gonna use fresh pumpkins rather than the can although you certainly could use canned pumpkin but I did grow a bunch of pumpkins this year so I'm going to be cooking them and showing you how I do that before I do the next video that has the actual muffin recipe on it alright so what I have is two sugar pumpkins the smaller pumpkins in the front are the sugar pumpkins and the pumpkin in the back it's a little bit larger I don't believe it's a sugar pumpkin but it's still pretty small and I can easily work with it so the first thing you want to do is just wash off the outside of the pumpkins get off any of the dirt I usually just remove the stem and then I cut it straight down the center so I cut them completely in half once you cut the pumpkins in half you're ready to remove the seeds and remove the inside filling as far as cutting the pumpkins in half go make sure you have a really sharp knife it took every bit of a half an hour to open up those three pumpkins that I had just because my knives are horrible so a sharp knife is really important but as far as the seeds go I am going to cook the seeds I find it easier just use my hands and pull the seeds out and I'm just gonna stick them into a strainer and I'm going to rinse them off and then I'm gonna come back and I'll take a spoon to get the rest of the the insides out but I am just using my hands to kind of pull out all the seeds all the seeds have been removed so now all I'm going to do is take a spoon and kind of just scrape the bottom to get out all the rest of the insides you just get right in there and it'll all come out pretty easily for you I already did that to all the other pumpkins and you just kind of pull it out and just you know a couple times I'll get it all out once that's done and the pumpkins ready to go into the oven as you can see I did already do all the seeds I rinse them off in the sink and I did Pat them dry on a paper towel some people put a tiny bit of oil with this just a very small amount of olive oil I don't I just left a little damp and I sprinkled salt on it just enough to taste and these are ready to go into the oven at 250 degrees about 45 minutes to an hour you really just have to keep an eye on it when they start to get brown you want to take them out if you are in a hurry you could bake them at a higher temperature obviously it's going to cook a lot faster and you have to keep an eye on them because they can go from being perfect to burnt within a matter of minutes so 250 I'm going to keep them in for about 45 minutes to an hour and keep checking on them once the pumpkins are prepared you are gonna put them on a tray this is too many I'm not gonna have all of these on one tray the smaller ones I am NOT going to cut up I'm just gonna put them facedown on the tray this larger one I am gonna probably cut it in half or maybe even into quarters you could cut the smaller ones up if you want to cook faster I just find it easiest to just leave it like this especially since it took a half an hour just to cut them in half I'm going to keep them like this but you could cut them smaller to have it cook a little faster I'm gonna put it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes to an hour it really depends on how big your pumpkin is you should be able to pierce it with a fork so as soon as the fork kind of pierces through it and it's soft it's ready to come out the seeds they took about an hour I did cook them at 250 for the first half an hour and then for the second half an hour I did turn it up to about 300 they just weren't really browning at all so I did turn it up a little bit I kept an eye on them it did need the full hour but now it's got a nice toasted outside to it they're perfect so I would say start at 250 but if it's if it's not really cooking well you can always turn it up a little bit just keep an eye on it and they came out nice the pumpkin I also kept in for an hour this was at 350 and right now you can see that it's just peeling away from the skin I'm not really forcing it I don't have to work hard it's just kind of peeling right up for me what you want to do is either match this you can use a match or a potato masher you can use a food processor I'm just gonna throw it in the blender just for you know 30 seconds just to kind of mix it all together and really get it smooth and you can see over here that I did do this to some of the pumpkin already I just put it right in the blender maybe 30 seconds and now it's ready for the recipes I'm gonna let it cool I let it cool overnight and then I'm going to take out one cup size portions and I usually put them in a ziplock bag and then kind of wrap it all up and keep them in the freezer and then throughout the year whenever I need to make something with pumpkin most of the time it's between one and two cups for the recipe so I can just take out one or two bags let it fall out and it's ready to go so we have some pumpkin ready now for our pumpkin streusel muffins that we're going to make next ",

        "content": "today I'm going to show you one of my signature holiday treats these little mini pumpkin cakes they're not real pumpkins they're cake that looks like a pumpkin and they are delicious okay they're buttercream spicy cake inside cream cheese frosting in the middle and no fondant people just pure deliciousness so much easier than you think let's get started to make the batter we're gonna use three cups or 360 grams of all-purpose flour and I will be winging this out because I don't want to measure it exactly in a measuring compass so much work all right and you go to 35 to 78 okay 360 grams exactly away you go now we're gonna add in the rest of our dry ingredients that's a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of baking powder two teaspoons of ground cinnamon ground ginger allspice a pinch of cloves which is optional some people hate clothes I don't mind them at all and a nice pinch of nutmeg healthy pinch there don't forget half a teaspoon of salt let's sit that all together give it a quick whisk and now we're gonna set it aside and mix up the wet mixture for the wet mixture we're adding in 1/4 cup of vegetable oil 1/2 a cup of melted coconut oil if you don't have coconut or if you're on a fan just use 3/4 of a cup of veggie oil and it'll be totally cool now writing in a quarter cup of brown sugar - honking cups of regular old granulated sugar and don't forget 1/3 of a cup of plain yogurt this adds in some extra moisture okay now let's mix it up and then a lot of eggs alright that clean up nicely now we're adding in three eggs one at a time let them incorporate before you add the next in and mix on like lowish one two and three just make sure you scrape the bottom of the bowl down mix for a few more seconds to make sure everything is incorporated and then we'll move on to the next step now we're gonna be adding in our dry mixture and alternating that with the pumpkin don't think I forgot the pumpkin at the dry mixture and the pumpkin puree and about three all training batches little pumpkin a little bit more dry mixture a little bit more pumpkin and we can toss the rest of the dry mixture in there okay everything's in scrape the bowl down makes a little bit more and we're done okay done now we're gonna transfer this to a piping bag and then pipe our mixture into our mini bundt pans you can butter and flour your pans but a lot of little details in there I'm just gonna use baking spray which is like a sprayable oil that has flour already mixed in and it also smells like supermarket sheet cake which I find strangely intoxicating okay anyways spray away alright that's all done now let's get that mixture in there alright snip the tip off with some scissors right and now we're gonna pipe this in don't overfill these half way is totally fine because our pumpkins are gonna be regular pumpkins not really tall crazy-looking pumpkins resist the temptation to overfill I know it's very strong this will make enough for 18 little mini buns so this is a batch number one plop it down like this or on your counter if you're not afraid of denting it get that batter all in there and now we're gonna pop this into the oven at 350 for like 17 minutes maybe 20 we'll see the center should be set these bake up really quick though these bake for about 20 minutes at 350 and you don't have to let them cool in the pan let's pop them right out take a look at this very good alright now we can let them cool down to room temperature then Frost them let's make that buttercream while they cool for the buttercream I've added in four sticks or 1 pound of unsalted butter at room temperature giving it a little cream in the mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and now I will be pouring in two pounds of confectioner's sugar in a couple batches don't add vin all at once if you do there'll be a giant poof and a mess all over the place add the sugar in close and I'm gonna cover this with a tea towel because I do not want that toxic sugar cloud okay a lot of sugar so let's pour in some of that milk right now good now we can add in some more sugar [Music] we're getting close I'm gonna add the rest of the sugar in I do want the buttercream to be a little bit more stiff it's not a sheet cake it's like a little pumpkin that you have to carve so you want the buttercream to have a nice firm consistency I'm also gonna add in my little splash of vanilla a good very healthy pinch of salt because that's a lot of sugar my buttercream looks perfect except I'm making orange pumpkins not the white ones so orange food coloring and a little bit of brown the orange is very bright we're gonna tone it down and make it more natural with a brown I'm just gonna add in a drop or two of orange and an actual drop or two of brown one it right now let's mix on low all right this is the color I have right now it doesn't look that orange however once the buttercream dries out after it's set it'll become more vivid this is an extra step you could totally use the regular buttercream but I love cream cheese frosting and something about it what these pumpkin cakes is addictive so we're making a little batch of cream cheese frosting to sandwich in between our pumpkin cakes one 8 ounce package of room-temperature cream cheese into your mixing bowl then 2 cups of confectioner's sugar but let's give us a mix first all right now one cup in mix it up adding a teaspoon of vanilla what's amazing cream-cheese frosting is the best I love it all right a little bit more sugar two cups in total look at this this is so creamy it's unreal if you can see but it's just like this silky cream cheese and delicious amazingness transfer this to a piping bag because we're gonna start assembling our pumpkins okay oh yeah I'm like fantasizing about all the ways I could eat this right now I'm gonna snip the tip off of this there we go squeeze it up and we're ready to pipe my little pumpkin buns are nice and room temperature you don't want to try to do this when they are warm people they will just all the butter cream will melt off and you're gonna be so sad it's happened to me when I've been making a cake and my husband says like what's going on and what's going on with your cake and like it's fine let's get started we're gonna start off by trimming these because it's a little tall and I don't want all that space so give them a nice flat top and lower it down this is called a snacking top it's delicious do the same for the other one okay now when you place them together that looks like a nice pumpkin to me like a nice little baby mini pumpkin next step is to pipe that cream cheese frosting in there just give it a nice swirl perfect top it off take a little bit of your snacking top not too much because this is for you to eat and we're going to fill the center in so a little bit of extra frosting just pop in that top there and push it down there we go now let's start enrobing it in some orange buttercream let's get some parchment paper cut a square now parchment square goes on and stays on pipe the bottom so here just get it started don't worry about it looking perfect or anything right now now start piping it off swirl nice and thick you'll be removing a lot of this so don't feel like I have this gross so much buttercream most of its gonna come off in the shaping process there we go a beautiful pumpkin all done I'm just kidding now we have to shape it but what you can do for a shaping tool some magical special thing you got at a store for special Baker's special no you're gonna use a yogurt container any kind of plastic container will do actually so sorry I'll just cut that rib off this is the part we need that flexible edge so let's cut a little bit off and now what shape will you cut well let me tell you it's gonna be like a V so one I'll pick that up later and two like that this is going to help us shape the ribs of that pumpkin so let me show you how that'll work I'm gonna go in pull up like that then turn continue the process now we're just roughing out a pumpkin it is not gonna look cute it's not gonna look great it's a rough comfortable clean you're too often between swipes and then just keep rotating and completing it and already this is looking pretty nice like I can imagine this being a pumpkin we're getting close let's cut another tool from that yogurt container and this time it's gonna be almost like it is right now just kind of a scallop its shape so just round it off a bit and we're gonna use that to clean up the center's look how much better that's looking already this is looking nice like I'm pretty happy with where my pumpkins at you can keep cleaning it off lift the bottom up so it doesn't look like a saggy pumpkin we want a young baby pumpkin now we're done this is a done pumpkin am i done done no we're done into the fridge to chill when you put this in the fridge it's gonna darken up and it'll become nice and firm once it's firm you can begin really sculpting it and smoothing it down till it looks like a real pumpkin so exciting it's gonna be magic okay into the fridge and I'm gonna come back out with the chilled one okay I just finished washing my hands because I will be putting my hands on these pumpkins and some people are really grossed out when they see someone touching their food here's my children look how chill it is I can actually handle it and it's not golf falling off yet back on the turntable and what we're gonna do is shape it a little bit you can use your smoothing tools and you know now it's like sculpting really nicely but if you just use some clean wet fingers so wet your fingers and some water and then look at that you can just shape it so quickly that's magic right there so I'll just do one side really quickly so you can see right doesn't that look nice already it looks so much more like a pumpkin not a pumpkin a pumpkin all right just keep wetting your fingers off because they will be covered in butter and sugar and then continue smoothing this would be such a fun project for little kids to help out with you make the little pumpkin cakes you start shaping them so you rough them out and chill them and now little kids dip their fingers in and then just shape the pumpkin it's like basically playing with clay we are all done except for the stem what about the stem there's so many different things you can do I'm gonna give you the easiest option because I mean this is kind of a lot of work already I don't want to do more I have things to do I need to live my life so here's your easiest thing use a real stem just clip it off and snip it on let me show you these are called Cinderella pumpkins but basically they're baby goons with long stems and if you buy one you can just use your shears and snip off the tip careful of your fingers I take no responsibility and then pop it on like that what is that a real pumpkin oh my gosh it looks so real with this real stem on it you just pop it off when you want to eat live your life okay so this needs to chill once again that way you can handle it put it on your plate serve it I think this is like the cutest little decoration that you could have as a centerpiece you could have it as like a surprising dessert let me know what you think in the comments do you like these would you make an orange one green one gray blue white I couldn't like the idea of a white pumpkin but I don't know if someone would identify that and think Oh a pumpkin but I like using less food coloring so that's my reason okay into the fridge you go cute little baby pumpkin are you ready for the big reveal take a look at this this is a palette knife for a painting by the way but it's a little mini cake dispenser do you see this this is so delicious moist pumpkin cake that cream cheese frosting and it's vanilla buttercream on the outside the fondant just wouldn't taste good I'm gonna eat this and love it okay hmm oh my god that is so good the spiciness the moist pumpkin cake that cream cheese frosting has the perfect Tang it is addictive and the vanilla buttercream is nice and mellow and not too sweet oh I really hope you get to make this blow thanks for watching hit that like button and don't forget to subscribe ",

and we take Halloween seriously we do a lot of things with pumpkins and we love giant pumpkins and word on the street from potassium OH huija Alto Google Monde we're going to the shontella market to check out our giant pumpkin which apparently which is that oh gosh which apparently is waiting for us at the market we're gonna check out the merchandise before they deliver it apparently it's a thousand plus passes can be amazing you ready to see the pumpkin no yes straight go whoa what happened this bike I think we see our pumpkin yeah I think this is our man behind us Philip how you doing hey how are you so good okay this pumpkin right over here they're ways little less than it hasn't been it's a little baby that takes six months to grow about six months right yeah six months which means at some point and it started in greenhouse and then since then did in the peel like 28 August 2008 3000 30 pound a day it puts on 30 pounds a day correct yeah 15 August that's not possible I put it on 30 pounds in one day correct yeah you can actually see it growing he's gone so that pumpkin in August is gonna put on what do you say 500 pounds in one month about it yeah so it's about 500 pound in early August and we'll go up to nine oh good and more if possible in about 45 days that's a lot that's a lot that's insane last year the pumpkin we got was 1,200 pounds yeah and world week are 2,300 yeah but amazing amazing it's round it's about two tons of veneer two tons okay let's get on this two tons of manure yeah goes into that so when we eat that pumpkin we're actually eating manure it's one leaf for one pound thousand pound pumpkin as a plant leaves on the vine take up the Sun to help it grow and about 200 gallons of water per day if there's a thousand leaves how long is the vine one second we're talking to pumpkin is half an acre the vine itself can be half an acre you don't think about a you know decent parking lot then you could only fit one pumpkin in it so when I'm trying to grow one on my front lawn which is two feet by chance so it takes like a acre to grow one pumpkin like that correct and you can think about 40-something hours for a week you put on going like that because you need to of all the weeds remove all the male flowers make your own polarization and there's a lot of Derrick also in it so you need to cross pollinate from another giant pumpkin and it's like cows so I mean but basically then how many weeks to grow this thing early May till late September but that's not be you know you don't do that if you don't like it I'm passionate about it can crack at the last minute when you lift it you put in like a thousand hours of work that goes into a pumpkin or you know I already you a crack one fix it I fix it with silicon to make sure yeah it's not the any fermented inside yeah yeah absolutely so that it doesn't rot if it cracks router gets in and that's when it so you can fix it with silicon great amazing probably up questions we've always had this pumpkin the chill ball that I damn that's Aladdin's turbine it is one pumpkin and it grows like that natural together nothing expert and they're not only looking good but it's also good tea it just knows to grow like that with the ribbon around it you don't put a rubber band to make sure it grows a cockeyed that's crazy and then the one you're holding in your hand will set I spelled that you gotta and so you slice it into like this and then on the other side and you make crispy did akela like kale crispy kale a very little issue or you can stuff it with a sausage they look like ducks oh they grow like that naturally called pickles 100 speckles ones that called Swann okay you know what from in Africa they're making a music instrument with it what also interesting pumpkin stuff here okay so the ones behind me they taste like hazelnut correct that's the traditional but see always on the squash slice so they're super excited that's about 20 pound amazing and so that you just cook a menu motions of paces correct and one of these ugly ones behind you beautiful ones uh Bree squash Hubbard squash and that's the green and the blue one can make nice french fries with it pink bananas that's another pretty easy squash and it's a very very suiting one the first we tease yep you want to go look at Lego little jack-o'-lantern the most popular one for a pumpkin pie this one what kind of pumpkin is this now I just a cop you want to get that pumpkin okay can you can you eat those no it's only the card it okay what happens if you either to probably get sick really okay give me good this is oven so you just slice the head and you cut it with maple syrup you live in the oven for a half an hour and in Quebec it's not a dessert until you feel something with maple syrup that does hold on that's a cross between a suit or maybe this gift is so cute nice alright we just came here to get a pumpkin but this episode is turning into everything you need to know that pumpkins left everything you need to know about pumpkins for the Halloween season sure yeah okay we're getting one of those okay perfect that is a tomato pumpkin that ends our pumpkin information extravaganza and I'll tell you how it all tasted is that the best carrot Eve ever tasted in your life all right did you ever know that there was so much science into pumpkins you did know that a smart kid oh yeah behind us put a GMO who's out to go mom at the jante law market if you ever hear it's amazing and if you ever had any pumpkin questions Philip is the man to ask how's that carrot it's good at spicy a the very flavorful natural character much more flavor than store-bought carrots you have a cold never mind [Music] you ",

        "content": "hey welcome back today I'll be making a seasonal cutout I'm gonna make my version of wood and pumpkin everybody there's been a lot of them on the internet here lately but this is going to be my version I know the last video that I did on a tool review for the handsaw you noticed on my video that I had some falling leaves at the beginning at the end that's a new transition that the software that I'm using has decided to put in and since this is that time of the season I thought I would go ahead and add that to it kind of add that little touch for the fall season to the videos hope you enjoy them today I'm going to hopefully go through and show you how to cut out one of these pumpkins assemble it paint it and you have your own little wooden decor for fall October Halloween Thanksgiving whatever you think you can paint on any color you want now that I've got the pattern cut out for the pumpkin itself I'm going to go ahead and measure these slats that I have from some previous cut-offs and I'm going to go ahead and cut them here so they fit this length then I'm going to glue them on here use the bandsaw again cut the edges again that way you'll have the strip's on here and then go ahead and apply some paint okay got my pattern here got my slats cut out have to excuse a mess on my bench here this project with the pumpkin is kind of like a impromptu quick project for today since its kind of raining out had a little boo-boo drop the pumpkin pattern and the top of the stem broke off so put some glue on there put some blue tape to hold it should be good enough now to go ahead and apply the rest of the glue so I've got my hot glue gun here I'm gonna go ahead and apply hot glue to the back list to stick here and put it in place don't worry about getting them on straight like I said this is a quick project now these slats that you're going to put on they're going to be approximately eighth inch width from the next one you're gonna go ahead and get these all glued on and that's it got all the slats glued on there then we're going to take it to the bandsaw and cut the edges to fit thee I'm going to take the pattern here and I turned it upside down and I'm going to cut it as close as I can with the bandsaw cut these off nice and even with the outside pattern and there you have it I've gots got to put it on a sander and sand these down and put a coat of paint on there and you have your own wood and pumpkin for the season applied a coat of pumpkin or acrylic paint that I got at my local hardware store and I didn't show you this before but I also cut out a couple pieces of plywood here to add as leaves on the top of the stand so right now the pumpkin is applied I'm going to go ahead and apply the other colors black I've got four inside the grooves here on the pumpkin green for the leaves and brown for the stem and I'm going to blend these in to kind of give them that nice look then once this is complete and you'll go ahead and have yourself a wooden pumpkin that you can use for Halloween Thanksgiving fall just general fall decorations in your home and it's very easy to make a lot of tools that I used don't necessarily have to use them you can do a lot of the sanding and stuff on your own or you can leave it just a little bit more rustic you'll see here that this is kind of little dark so when I'm done with that I'll go ahead and paint pumpkin back over top of that so it's it doesn't look as bad trying to give it that black Marshall now you know that these you can paint this hello everyone if you like real dark green you can use real dark green me I kind of like the floral green a little bit you can play in it as dark as you want I like mixing it with a little black because you know leaves all the time aren't necessarily just straight green they've always got some in the same way with the stem here touching it up here this is pretty much the finish product and again like I said you can paint it any color that you like I did mine the traditional make it look like a pumpkin but that's it you can make them any size you want any shape the white pumpkins are big you can even paint one white to give that white pumpkin look unhook this episode please like us on Facebook like us on YouTube and check out other videos that we may have hope that your project turns out as good as this one did and good luck ",

        "content": "what's up guys we come on here welcome to the next episode and today I got a super epic video for you guys and spirit of Halloween we're going to be doing how to make Halloween pokemon pumpkin and you guys are excited for this please do like and subscribe as you guys can see it looks super cool I made a gengar one and it looks absolutely amazing if you guys wanna do something like this for yourself watch the video [Music] so further ado let's get into actually making that Gengar pokemon pumpkin like you just saw earlier so the first thing you're gonna need is obviously a pumpkin a big orange one flaw obviously not too big you want to be medium sized but also not too small next you guys gonna need a pumpkin carving kit it comes with the little shovel kind of thing and the Carver with socks or like a saw end next you guys are gonna want some tape and following that you are going to want a printout of the Pokemon that you are doing I will show you guys how to actually get that in a second you guys are also going to want a push pin and then I actually almost forgot what you're also going to want a kind of big bin for putting everything that's inside the pumpkin as well as a pair of scissors alright so now actually getting the print out of your post mind you're gonna wanna search pokemon.com pumpkins this is the official Pokemon website so don't click any of the ads or stuff like that make sure it's the official one and when you click it you'll know because it'll look like this as you can see they have that really cool Pokemon art and then all these stencils these top ones to actually just add in 2017 and they have plenty of them a lot of them are really really nice as you see those thick anger I'm doing and if we scrolled on top you can see some of the 7th generation Pokemon now of course you guys want to make sure the one you're doing you're actually able to do because a lot of these look really hard as you continue it's land it like I don't even know how that's possible I originally wanted to mimic you but I just didn't know how it's going to be able to do it so the ones that you can actually do scroll down I know fights from easier ones such as this curl bat the beignet these ones are actually doable Gengar obviously I'm doing gastly lit wick and even pumpkaboo so I recommend doing these ones because they definitely look more doable and some of those harder ones and then once you guys have found the one you're doing like big anger I just click on it and then in the top right you're gonna see a little print icon so just print your Gengar and you're gonna be good all right guys so for this next step you are going to need your pumpkin carving kit so your shovel and your knife I do recommend getting a pair itself I did my dad helped me with this so thanks dad and then what you are going to have to do here is with your kind of nice you're gonna have to cut a circle around the whole top and then take it off and then take out all the insides of the pumpkin so all the seeds all the orange you're going to take that out and then don't put it in your little bow [Music] all right so once you guys are done that and your pumpkin is all clean and the top is off you're going to need your printout and your scissors and then you're just gonna kind of cut a circle around the whole pokemon stencil just so that it's easier to put on the pumpkin all right so now that you guys have character Gengar stencil and is into my circle what you're going to need is your tape and then take your tape and you're going to tape your being our stencil onto your pumpkin where you want it now obviously it is kind of hard to do while filming because I'm on sort of an angle so I try to do my best here but obviously you guys are going to want to make it as secure as possible so when I am done this I am going to make it a little bit better alright guys I have secured my anger a little bit better as you can see he is more flat on the pumpkin obviously it is a pumpkin so it's not going to be completely on it you guys just want to do it so that it is more or less on the pumpkin now what you guys are going to need is your pushpin and then what you're gonna be doing is kind of putting your PIN so making a dotted line all along all the black so kind of outlining all the black that you see on the pokemons so it's going to be all around its kind of ears its eyes its mouth everything that is black alright guys so I've completely made pushpin dotted line around all of the black guys I'm not gonna lie it was kind of hard so you are gonna want to take little breaks and once you guys are done just take it off and obviously guys can't really seat well on the camera if I bring it up I think as you can see there's a dotted outline of Gengar it looks actually really cool I'll give you guys a bit of more HD look here in a second so as you guys can see here it is it's much easier to see now but it looks really cool as you can see completely outlined image of a gang guard because I put the pushpins all around where it was black alright guys so this next step you're gonna take your pumpkin which is completely outlined and your pumpkin Carver and you are going to completely curve around that dotted line if you guys are young you're gonna want to ask your parents for help or if you're allowed to do on your own I decided to here by myself but you definitely may want a parents help alright guys so now let's get it there time-lapse and shoot the time-lapse music [Music] alright guys so again I'm not gonna fluff it up that was pretty hard but obviously my Ganga looks amazing it was all worth it it's not you guys gonna do is take your bowl and just empty out all the the innards of your pumpkin that was dropped inside when you were carving it so I'm gonna do a little time up here and as you can see everything is out and now my pumpkin is completely empty it is beautiful it is done now all that's left to do is take a candle and put it inside and use it on Halloween night alright guys so thank you so much for watching this video where I showed you how to make your very own pokemon pumpkin if you guys liked this video be sure to leave a like and subscribe for more videos I hope you guys enjoyed and stay tuned for more epic episodes [Music] you [Music] you ",

        "content": "hey what's up everyone this is kevin from happy gardening and today i'm going to talk about some techniques that i use to get more and bigger pumpkins yes that is a pumpkin growing in my deck right there and for any of my returning viewers there's a little bit of different perspective of my pumpkin patch we are actually sitting on my deck and this is the first price high of the pumpkin and that is a vine that i have allowed to creep up onto my deck this isn't something that i'd planned it's more or something that just happened so i'm just going with it now this pumpkin through a little bit of a wrench in my original plans my pumpkin patch but we're going to get back to that later for now we're going to take you guys down to my pumpkin patch alright here are my vines up there on the deck is the pumpkin we were just talking about let's give you guys a little update for my returning viewers and for my new viewers be sure to check out my other videos of our youtube channel now that is the mound for my two Burpee first-prize hybrid vines you can see the mound is a little bald and that's because I was hit with some blight and I've been fighting blight for the past month but for the most part the rest of these coupons are very very healthy now top part of your screen is one vine and that vine runs along my deck and then right along the deck a secondary vine shot up and on that secondary line is that pumpkin that we are looking at one now this vine runs all along the deck and pretty much goes into my Connecticut field vines there on the right part of your screen and the other first-prize hybrid is on the bottom part of your screen and that vine runs along the edge of my patch and there are two very nice-looking pumpkins on there already this line runs all the way across my yard give you guys a little bit better perspectives about the size of these pumpkins I've averaged size hands and these two pumpkins are working very very healthy now first price hybrids can grow up to 300 pounds neither of these will get up to 300 pounds on because there are two of them on one line now right there in the middle of your screen is my second mound and on the second mound are four different vibes on the top part of your screen are two Connecticut field lines and on the bottom fiber screen are two Big Macs lines with the two connecticut fields one goes up on the trellis while the other was trained to run up and along the deck on this mount are also two Big Macs finds and those on the bottom part of your screen now on the very bottom part of your screen is one bond and this mine produced one of my very first pumpkins of the season this one right here and then on the top part of this noun in between the deck and the vine on the bottom fiber screen is another vine and this vine runs into my side yard you can see that there are two pumpkins on this vine here is a better view of one of my big masses give you a better idea of the size now this mine and this stress right here originally had about three or four different pumpkins all that were pollinated in fact there's one right there so what happened to them well I didn't cut them off that's for sure what happened was that the vine actually naturally chose to pick one pumpkin and focus all of his energy on that one pumpkin and it knew that in order to have its best odds producing those seeds focuses energy and grown this one pumpkin rather than growing four or five smaller ones so over the course of about a week I lost two or three of the other pollinated pumpkins on this particular vine now if I wanted to grow the biggest pumpkin possible on this one vine I would have cut one of these pumpkins off very early on but my original goal this year so this is the first time I'm going first-prize hybrids what to grow as many as possible just to see what they're like so I just want the flow and I had two of these growing right next to each other and I can't believe how well they're doing this is awesome and there are some additional pumpkins forming and the enemies line I'm just going to see they tape enough but I'm not too worried about cutting them off they take that's great and it's not I have these two great pumpkins on this vine now this late in the season you want your vine to start focusing all of his energy on the fruits themselves and not on the vines and if they haven't already you'll probably notice that your vines have slowed down and grow significantly all the secondary vines have probably come to a stop and your primary vine has probably also really slowed down and growth and this is the vines natural way of same rr8 I'm going to take a step back from growing leaves I have enough leaves to produce energy for my fruit now lost all the leaves the vine also shoots out secondary roots all on the vine and for any of you vine growers if you point a vine and notice that it's pretty secure to the ground and that's because the vine has naturally shot out roots to try to get more nutrients so right here that's about as far as I can pull it if you see it there's little there it is there's the tap root right there shooting straight down into the grass so because of these secondary roots you hear a lot about burning your vines and there are different ways of barrier vines some people bury all of the vine completely other people don't bury the vines at all for example just like this mine growing this trellis now as for myself I did not bury all of the vines this year what I did instead was chose do spot burning or what I call spot burrowing and essentially I took one part garden soil and one part compost and it's placed amount of soil early on the bond at the main node now further down the vine I did the same thing right over here I just chose a random place there really was no rhyme or reason to it I just picked an area where I saw some group growing out and covered it with some top soil and compost now again all these secondary roots will help you grow more and bigger pumpkins something else that I like to do is it take the secondary vines that are growing out close to the pumpkins I'm just going to take the tip of this vine I'm going to cut it off right at a node right the last move and after I cut it off I'm going to bury this with my mixture of one part compost and one part garden soil and what's going to happen or what I hope to happen is for more roots to shoot out right here so that it pulls all the nutrients in this area right into the pumpkin right there so I'm gonna take a step back and do that with a coupla font and show you how I do it [Music] alright for this one just going to cut it off way around here and bury from here all the way through here now shoot out weeds right here play here [Music] and we're gone it is that easy give you a closer local what we just finished so it is mixture of one part compost one part garden soil and some fertilizer cut off the tip this line is pile the soil loosely on top of the vine making sure that is completely covered you can go as high as you want or you can just simply just cover the vine and what's going to happen now is the vine is going to grow some additional roots and depending on how well it goes this line might even shoot out a second primary root right out of that area and again it's just another area for the vine to pull additional nutrients into the pumpkins and this is a little further down the vine where I simply just buried something find was some of my extra soil mix and one of my viewers had asked about this and asked how I burned my vine so you can see that I do something very simple and again I don't go crazy about it so it's nothing too complex I do it very very easy and it does a job and burying all of your vines works great if you have a lot of soil or if you're not growing your vine on your lawn could you imagine how much soil mix I would need to bury all of my vines my grass would actually love it next season but it would not be cost efficient at all now earlier I mentioned that this pumpkin kind of threw everything off a little bit and what I meant by that was that as I mentioned earlier I wasn't really trying to grow one big pumpkin this year and the vine that this pumpkin was going on originally had about 4 or 500 pumpkins and I wasn't intending on growing any pumpkins on this deck but then as soon as I saw her I was going right there I couldn't help with the pollinated just to see what would happen and after I pollinated that flower every other Punk on the vine just died off what so even though I wasn't originally trying to grow one big pumpkin this year it looks like I'm going to try doing that and we're going to see how it goes so what I'm going to do is cut off the end of this vine and place the end into a smart pot that I have and for a rest of the season I'm also going to trim off any new female flowers that I see growing just so that the entire vine can focus all of this energy on this one pumpkin right here so I have the smart pot here and I'm not using it for a restless reason so I figured I would use it to try to grow this big pumpkin so I have my realness I have a wish it with a little bit of additional compost and added some fertilizer just going to mix it all together you see that bear skull from the roots from what else proves the growing in here and not a big deal now there aren't any signs of any roots growing on here yet but if you look right here this little white spot right here is where a root would shoot out so what I'm going to do is just cut this off right here and stick the tip of this line into the smart pot now on here is another female flower and as I mentioned earlier you want to pinch off all of your female flowers so that you're fine take all the energy of producing these and take that energy and put the tourist pumpkins instead so I'm just going to take this just come pinch it off and ask for the bind it really doesn't matter where I cut it off I cut it off right here over here I'm just going to take it right between as a special it's off this plug right here and all this growth I'm going to take the finals I'll just stick it right into this small pot break off these as well too and there you go that's it I'm not gonna worry about the leaves too much the plant will figure itself out I left this one out right here just so I can produce the relative energy for the bond and we'll see the rest of these pop up sometimes they do pop back up we're just going to leave it right here now there is a lot of vines for this one pumpkin so there is a lot of reasoning is there are a lot of energy releases so the hope is that maybe there's some good genetics here as well and I'll grow pretty big puffiness and if you're interested in seeing how big this get be sure to subscribe to my channel and I will be sure to provide updates of represented so there you go therapy tips from my bucket that I use to try to grow more and bigger pumpkins and just to summarize I bury someone vines to promote secondary root growth I cut off from the ends of some of my secondary vines and bury them again to try to bring some of the energy directly to the pumpkins and lastly I pinch off any additional female flowers that see growing for rest of the season if you enjoyed this video be sure to click the like button to let me and

getting the seed ready hopefully to increase the odds for a to germinate what I have here is a ultrafine tip sharpie marker that's going to allow me to put the weight or the identification directly on the seed coat I have a fatter sharpie market they call them fine tips what I use for these is to put on the bag we're using the classic bag method with 80 to 85 degree temperature I then go through the next step and I will file the edges so I just have a piece of 120 grit sandpaper here to file some of the edges then have a glass of warm water and a paper towel that will ultimately be so disappointing its moist wrung out seed will be put in here and have been placed in the plastic bag so that the humidity environment in here can be conducive for germination so the key part start and start with your seed and grab the marker open it up this one is actually labeled and bar-coded here on my arm seeds and you've got the fine tip sharpie marker you're going to work on labeling of the seed coat this way it ensures that you don't have a charge of mix-up of seeds with also having the plastic bag labeled with the same code so now I go through and label the see and then take the larger sharpie marker take my small piece of sandpaper I find wrapping it simply right around the Sharpie mark of that line makes it very easy to be able to go through and start to file the speed I just do a light filing nothing too bad that one is severely named to coat reason why I do this is it allows water to be able to get into the seed coat a little bit easier and also in the seed coat pushes through the soil if it happens to get stuck this simple filing allows me to pull it off a little bit easier to this side here would be filed and this would be the side that would not be filed as of yet so I go through in a file just so you can get an idea of the level of filing depth ultimately the bird is going to come out the tip here and that's where most of the water is going to be infiltrating but in the end just a nice light filing on both sides so now we have our seed again labeled and filed comes the next step which is PI the step that most people do wrong I have a simple paper towel here against if we folded over and over itself so that we'll be able to fit inside the ziplock baggie again which is labeled labeled seed label ban this ultimately is going to fit right in here the key part that most people do wrong you can see here with my world water is they over wet it so you come through put it in the water this is way too wet at this stage I want to be sure to go through and wring it out pretty much try to get it as dry as you can and through wring it out what that leaves us is pretty much just a moistened paper towel through here find the actual fold area open it up place the seed in the middle just like that fold it over seal over itself grab your plastic baggie let's see it's a little hard your hands get wet seal it up and you're all set for the next step go downstairs okay what you're simply looking at here is a cooler that contains a heat map and also some towels on it to help regulate the temperatures is see the heating mat down there in the bottom with the simple few layers of towel washcloth over it to help regulate the temperature there's our C still encased in its plastic bag right there and the probe that you see there is for temperature regulation so that probe there comes up is right around and 4.2 is open the lid a little bit that's exactly what you want to see there what you may notice also is I have a sock at the corner and what that sock does is allow me to adjust how open or how closed this lid is which helps again regulate the temperature in their goal is I'm aiming for 84 to 85 degrees we're back a few days later check on the seeds as you can see temperatures still holding around 85 degrees or so so that's been kept consistent through the whole time we have our little baggie out same seed that started here open the bag up and if you can see that in there so you the seed there the little root coming out that's what we're looking for so at this point we're going to go through and we're going to pop this out into potting media so what we've done here is we've just simply controlled the germination process captured it because it's 85 degrees with consistent moisture now we've got a root now we've got to ensure that this seed gets into soilless mix or soil so that the roots can then grab onto nutrients and then start to grow the plant so what you see here is in the growing setup what I have here is in a basement controlled lighting there is a magnetic ballasts there that goes to a 1,000 watt metal halide light bulb so simply I go through and I pre moisten the soil make sure I have my label so I know what seed that's going into this pot and grab my seed directly from the propagation chamber in it up you can see here the actual seed and the root you can see it got a little curly you see the labeling that I had done on it previously sittin sure it's a twelve sixteen I simply take my finger in the previs and area go down about an inch which is about that far literally just drop the seed in cover up with media pack it down lightly take my label put my label in and go through and soak the media there you want to soak just about the point that starts coming out the bottom or stopped just before then that's all it takes under this squirrel light heat is projected down you'll also replicate keep Matt under here so when I turn the light off at night to give the plants 18 hour days I will kick the heat mat on so that the media is still becoming warm and you can see this is perfect right to the point here where just water just started to come out good see I do use some aluminum foil to help the heat transfer at night I have one of those right here simply fold that up and over each the water there that one right there hopefully in a two days another C thing that I'd started it'll look something like this you can see they're starting to push out starting to remove and will remove that seed coat so that's pretty much all there is to it to get it started at one ",
