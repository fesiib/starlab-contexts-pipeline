        "content": "alright so we've shown you how to get the electronics Corral but there's much more where that came from the organizing continues with another cluttered closet but this tight space comes with its own challenges this angled wall really makes it a bear to organize a closet like this and as you can see the shelf they have in here now not holding up really well yeah so I'm going to teach you how to make some pine shelving in a pinch and this is a true DIY project because you're not going to be able to find a shelf at the store that's gonna fit this closet perfectly that's right and these are all simple cuts we're making to get this custom closet underway we grab our supplies level stud finder tape measure hammer anchor and screws a marker safety glasses and a drill plus a miter saw and some pine wood for the cleats and the shelves why don't we start with the demo then we can go out and cut some wood and get started on the shelf sounds good alright Shawn we have the demo done now time to get started our first self is going to be about belly button hi now I plan on installing the shelves with cleats so it's going to be a brace that it gets attached to the walls we need a cleat for the right side for the backside and the left side we need two short cleats for the right and left side we're going to go with a measurement of eight inches okay we're using a 12 inch shelf and that's going to give us plenty of support for the backside we're going to use a 15 inch clean shot also brought 12 inch pine wood that we'll use for our shelves because the closet has that tricky angled wall we'll need to cut one side of the wood on an angle which brings us to our first official step so Ryan our shelf is going to be 12 inches deep so that means we need the width at the point of 12 inches and we also need the width at 0 inches to make this angle Shawn places a tape measure on the floor to get an accurate with be sure to take the thickness of your floor molding into account 2 so now the fun part we get to go out and cut some wood let's go do it alright okay Ryan we've got the cleats and we're all set to mount them to the wall now we're going to mount them in a couple different ways I have a stud finder here but this is a closet that doesn't have a lot of studs where we need the cleats to go to so in that case we're going to go ahead and use anchors all right Sean take us through it okay Ryan I've got the cleat on the wall now I'm going to take a drill bit and drill right through the cleat and into the drywall then I'll have a mark for the anchor okay so Ryan I've got a mark on the wall on my anchors on the wall but I'm going to drill the screws into the wood just a little bit so they pop out just slightly so I could see exactly where I'm putting them on the wall okay Ryan the next step is to get a cleat on this side I'm going to place a level on the cleats and that will determine whether or not the shelf can settle we follow the same steps as our first cleat but this time it's my turn to secure the wood to the back wall while drilling in the screw we hear the wood crack so I use Sean's old trick and lubricate the end of the screw with some liquid soap works like a charm alright Sean the cleats are in the Shelf should lay right on top if we did it correctly let's test it out look at that and it does and you said that would hold how much that's gonna hold about a hundred pounds well the good news is we got one shelf in the bad news we got two more to go so basically we're going to do the same thing all over again for the other shelves everything seems to fit nice snug and secure and we can customize these any way we wanted to absolutely Ryan now to make these shelves look nice they need a coat of paint it took us about an hour to finish up this intermediate project and it only cost us about $75 and supplies all of that and we were able to make use of that awkward wall which is coming off on an angle ",

        "content": "hello everybody welcome to another DIY video we are doing rope shells these shells are so versatile and are an awesome thing to bring into your interior space if you're decorating you need storage or you need a place to display items what's amazing about them is you can make them any height you want you might know that if you're shopping at the stores if you're trying to buy a shelf that's over six feet tall they're hard to find and they're also really pricey but this shelf you can make at any height you want for not a lot of money at all we have these in our style set which you may have seen in a recent style video and they're just too amazing not to show you how to make and then you guys can make them for yourself and save money and how about something else what's that about that nothing I will go through the basic supplies I was saying these are rope shelves so rope this is the natural fiber rope that you can get at any hardware store I personally like this rope because I really like the natural look to it but you could do a more streamlined cotton rope or even metal chain if you were super adventurous you need a piece of wood if you want more than one shelf you will need multiple pieces of wood but that's up to you guys but I'm just going to demonstrate for you guys on this one piece of wood repeat the same process with as many shelves as you need another very important thing is a drill with a nice hefty drill bit one that will give you a big enough hole to fit your rope through some pale pink paint I also have a big ruler here pencil sandpaper a piece of paper which you'll see what I'm going to do with that and some scissors that's all the supplies let's get into the deck a very important part of this DIY is balance now I know that I want the holes to be three inches in from both sides so in order to make sure that I am drilling the holes in the same spot on all the shelves I'm going to make a three inch square out of this paper and this is my template that's going to help me not have to use the ruler every time so I've just placed the square here and I'm just going to mark at the point three inches in on either side repeat the same easy process on all the corners alright I've got my holes marked and now I've got my drill with my nice big drill bit and I'm going to make the holes in my rope now you want to use some sandpaper to smooth out your shelf and you can also take this opportunity to smooth out the size of your shelf as well so before you paint you just want to wipe down your shelf with a cloth to make sure you don't have any dust left over from the sandpaper and now for the painting or the staining part whatever your choice another tip is if you don't want the look of brushstrokes with the paintbrush you could use your rag to kind of smooth in the paint a little bit this creates kind of more of a wash over the wood and with the magic of cinema my shelf is now dry and fully painted but of course you want to repeat this process with as many shelves as you want for your particular shelving unit the next step will be to take all of your painted shelves and actually get them strung up on the rope and hung up forever you're mounting them so I've got my rope and I've got two screw hooks here and this is what I'm going to use to anchor into my wood beams that I'm hanging from got my supplies got my painted shelves let's head to the shelf area yeah like some trail be hey hey we're making shelves sorry I just have this rope and my cowboy tendencies okay Mel you know those public doesn't say you want to err on the side of too much rope because you're going to be threading through the shelves and then knotting underneath each shelf on either side and you're going to be making a loop knock like when you take two threads at the same time and off them together like some so obviously that eats up some rope so you just want to make sure that you have a nice amount that you can trim later have to add so I have the center of this long piece of rope right here and obviously that's creating a loop and this loop I am going to use to hook on to my screw hope that will be screwed into my beam in the feeling and of course I have two of these which will be on either side of the shelves I'm gonna use a piece of tape here to wrap around the fray tip to just kind of seal the fibers make it easier to pull through the holes and I'm also going to make kind of a little like point that extends beyond the edge of the rope that will make it easy to pull through the hole all right so painted shelf here I'm just going to feed them through you want to start with your top shelf and work your way down so since this is my top shelf I'm pulling the rope to get closer to my middle point here is where I will hang from the ceiling and then not underneath so a nice loop not like this underneath which is going to secure the rope from pulling through the show that so this is one side I got to repeat this on the other side and then hang this up on my screw hook great nice and snug and straight so obviously the key when you're tying these knots underneath each shelf is to keep them kind of loose at first so you can finagle and make sure that your shelf looks nice and straight before you make the knot snug keep in mind as well when you put something on top of these shelves that will weight them down and also keep them balanced and sturdy so looking good straight shelves we got the final one to go all right Street yeah oh my gosh okay so this looks so cool they are floating but they're sturdy it's just just eject the position masterpiece if I do say so myself and then for these extra lengths of rope here you can remove the tape and just let them kind of foil on the floor in a cool industrial way which is what I personally like or you could trim them right underneath the knot so that the Shelf looks like is totally floating I like the coil look because it looks a little more industrial especially because we have concrete floors but totally up to you you how amazing are those shelves I'm so thrilled with this product I just I love how versatile it is and use types of shelves looks so good in so many different interior design styles so if you do this project please post pictures and hashtag mr. Kate so I can see because I would love to see your rendition there's obviously so many options you can go to the moon with these shelves that would be cool please subscribe so you don't miss any of our shoot for the moon projects that we will have coming at you very soon always we're working hard and thumbs up if you liked the video and comment too if you have any questions at all I would love to be your accomplice in accomplishing this project and tune in next time we will see you on the morrow friends shelf it no I love you that sounded weird I love you I love you bye mr. geek we are making geometric wall storage pockets they are functional they are sheep what I love about these is they are so cool-looking they're sturdy and they're functional you can use them in so many different areas of your home ",

        "content": "*Intro music* Hey guys! We're Evan and Katelyn! Today we're making an easy DIY entryway shelf, thingy with hooks you put keys in, and your mail on, and... We're making one of those This project is great for woodworking beginners, cause the steps are real easy to follow you only need two power-tools, and some supplies, which will be linked below This piece is made with a backing, two shelves, one with magnets under it for your keys, and four hooks Also, one shelf has a lip to hold mail But it's really modular. You can make it longer, add more hooks, take away the shelves, etc. For wood, we got select pine from the hardware store It's twice the price of the cheap stuff, but still cheap, and it's easier to work with, and it looks nicer There's a lot of options for hooks, like dowels, knobs, actual hooks But we ended up with these bath towel hooks from Amazon With our circular saw, we cut a 1x8 for the backing, and 1x4s for shelves We have a quick tip for this at the end of the video We also cut a square dowel to make a lip for the smaller shelf to hold mail We did a dry fit to make sure it all looked right, and then gave it a light sanding On the back, we marked where we wanted our long shelf to be, and three points to drill through into it We drilled pilot holes through just the backing first, and then we clamped on our shelf piece and drilled into that We should have used more that one clamp because it shifted, but luckily it was ok Then we did the same thing to screw the dowel to the smaller shelf It was a little misaligned, so we sanded down the ends Yes! Now it's time for magnets The magnets we used have a 3/8 inch diameter and are 1/4 inch long We put a piece of tape on our drill bit to help us drill to the right depth Then we used our favorite CA glue to secure the magnet in Once you do that, panic cause you don't know where your hammer is And grab a 2x4 to hammer it in Hey! Perfect!\nThat's one way to do it We attached the little shelf with screws, and took the whole thing outside to stain Nice! It makes the end look so much better We did two coats of shellac, which is sooo easy to work with and sanded with 600 grit sandpaper really lightly after each coat Then we applied some Briwax and buffed it out by hand And now, all that's left is hardware We marked and pre-drilled the holes We used our favorite screwdriver to drive these in by hand since they were a little close to the edge Then we added rubber feat so it'd hang straight, and not mark up the wall Next, we attached our hooks Side note: These were awesome cause they were really long, and way cheaper than anything else we found Should we go? Thank you guys for watching! *laugh* If you want to see what we're up to next, you can follow us on Instagram And for detailed plans, we have links below And don't forget to subscribe, if you haven't already Thank you! OK, quick tip time! Lining up your circular saw blade can be tricky, so here's how to make a little jig for accurate cuts First, raise the blade so that it won't cut all the way through the wood Then, clamp a speed square to some scrap wood mark a line along it, and cut a groove using the speed square as a guide Now you have a guide that shows you a line where your speed square should be, and a groove where your blade will cut You could cut all the way through the wood, instead of doing a groove But we like the groove, because it shows the thickness of the cut *beep* *hahahaha!* *beep* Do be do. Do be do be do Do You ready? *beep* Nooooo!!! *beep* The entry shelf... Our entry waaaaay... It's a haunted entryway Entry-waaaaa aaaaayyy!!! *beep* ",

        "content": "[Music] what's up guys it's a will to hear have been creative in today's video I share with you a DIY floating shelf tutorial I will be joined with by my husband's Harvey who will be explaining the process so here is Harvey to explain the process of how we created the shelf hi this is Harvey one of our first things where we got to do for our floating shelves is to get our top and bottom piece cut so you'll see me here measuring out the straight measurements and using straight cuts on the miter saw so that way we have our top support and our bottom for our shelves both of these cuts will be square and even our next cut is going to be for our sides always want to take your saw and cut the end part of your board and make sure you have a precise cut this is supposed to be a 45 so I cut just a little bit off of the end not too much not to take up too much material and have as best a 45-degree cut as you can get something that's nice and even so now next thing we're going to do is because this is the sideboard is to measure our length of a measure our length from the inside cutting out the outside cut the overall dimensions half the wraparound from the two boards we previously cut from for the top and the bottom so we measure it in market market with our pencil and then even though the miters going to cut a square line we're going to mark a square line with our our rafting square market very well and then once you got it all even proceeded to cut it carefully we show we're going to do this twice this first cut and we have to do another one for the other side the exact same way we did this our next cut is going to be for our front board of our shelf the one that everyone is going to see so once again we add this one has to be 245 because we're 45 in our short sides so we have 2 45 our front to match so cut it nice and square nice and nice and smooth r if your measurement again is going to be the length of our full board mark it with our rafter and cut it with our miter now that our boards are cut we want to try and dry fit everything together do this first before you move on to any other gluing and nailing just to make sure that your piece is cut any trimming or adjustments you have to make are done before you're in the middle of assembling everything together to attach our tops and bottoms to our size and our fronts we're going to use our kreg jig to drill some pocket holes and use pocket hole screws to hold us all together I me a little bit of glue also put in there just to hold it tight but the idea is a hold is as a one unit not pieces and join them together so use the drill bit that came with it set your dimensions to your board so your depth from this will be three quarter inches and then go down and spread them apart evenly enough so that way you have enough grip you want to shake out the extra little particles in in there and once again dri-fit to make sure that everything still looks good assembling the boards with the pocket screws can be a little tricky because it feels like you need so many other hands to hold one piece in another piece end the screw so Craig just sells a clamp that will fit right inside one of your pocket screw holes to hold your material against there again this is a step you do not want to rush you want to take your pocket hole screws and carefully put them in there don't rush it the screw is going to try and push your material away from the material that you're screwing into but your extra hand your handy helper here he's going to try to hold that material together it's tight as possible you don't want to squeeze it too tight and rip through your board screw in your screws with your screw gun carefully you don't want to drive through the material you want to drive up the material and join them together put a little glue on there as well and it'll hold it for a long time if you notice also we try to evenly spaced out the pocket hole screws to hold the material as best as possible so on this piece of board we have three to the front and a bottom piece will only have one but we still have two on each side the idea is to make all these pieces come together and become one piece and hold on to each other with all the screws use your handy helper as best you can I put it in the middle to hold the material in place the other sides are in there and you're watching you'll see that the sides we make sure we even them up make sure everything is nice and square nice and straight and then screw it in again don't rush take your time you at the end of putting all our pocket hole screws together we have to create our support for that goes up against the wall so here we are ripping a two by four it short we don't need all that material to go down and I'm going to make sure that there's enough bite on the wall enough thickness to hold our board security to the wall to enhance our support we also have like feet that come out from our support law so it'll be three short pieces board that will protrude out from our support for it up against the wall will screw them in to our support board after making sure there is close to the same as possible you don't want them to be too far off but you do want them to be close enough you we have our support cut and we have our small little pieces that are going to protrude out cut as well so we're going to join these all together each one of these are going to be held in the screw to themselves I marked them evenly spaced we obviously want one on each end and one as close to the center as possible so we'll pre-drill our screws first and if you need to do drill it prior to that you can but here I am just screwing them through an appealing mouth just a little bit then once we get them in there we're going to secure them to our small little pieces because we're trying to make like a ladder in a sense where it's going to help support the weight that goes from the wall through the other pieces so we're going to screw them in and make sure that they're in nice and tight nice and square you we have our main pieces for our or for the wall put together now let's make it act as one piece it's a one by three it is up in front that was also ripped down a little smaller that's going to hold the little protruding pieces tight and square again to our other piece and then as usual this dry fit and make sure it all goes together our support wants to be secured to the wall up against the stud so use your stud finder to find something that you can go into a stud on that wall mark your line even we know our one piece the dimension so we're going to market just short of being the full dimension so we have a straight line we have our studs we have our height from the floor and then we need to market on our material as you just don't want to just screw right through it so we'll market pre drill some holes on a material make sure they're nice and even they can hold on tight and we have that marked on there as well we go through and we pre drill some holes once again to make sure that we have a nice solid grip on the wall put one side at a time put it in the walls to cure it nice and tight use our level before you put in the last screw in what we're doing here if we want something to be straight even and secure we're getting close to the end but we need to put our our holding board in our finishing board to our frame back on there so put the middle piece in it will hold it in tight and then put the size and don't try to rip through the board you want this to be secure and tight not rip through it and make it split or anything bad to it put them in nice and tight our support on a wall is nice sturdy straight and even so we wind up pre-drilling two holes in our box that was created our actual floating shelf and put two short screws in it to hold it onto the wall and we know everything dry fits and fits well so we slide it right over to the top and screw our screws into our support there are countersunk so when you look at them straight and you look I'm screwing down you will not see them without actually looking for them and here is our finished product is stained with a walnut stain we let it dry for several hours putting up on there and don't don't want to touch it they want to have any smudges in there and as you can see everything else is hidden there screws are hidden their pocket hole screws in it looks very nice okay guys thank you so much for watching this video if you liked it please make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you haven't done so yet

        "content": "what's going on everybody I'm Johnny Brook welcome back to another crafted magazine video in this video I'm going to show you how to build these simple live-edge shelves stay tuned the first step in this build was trimming a little width off of the slab and creating a clean straight edge on one side I usually treks off for this but you could also use a circular saw with a straight edge this slab was an off cut from a larger slab I used to build a coffee table previously and there was a little epoxy left over from that build so I removed it with a chisel next I skip playing the slab I didn't need this to be dead flat just roughly flattened and the surface cleaned up a little bit the piece was too wide for my jointer but skip planing got it close enough this involved taking a little bit off of each side of the slab turning it over between passes until it was flat on both sides after planing I took the slab to the jointer and jointed one edge squaring up with the face of the slab next I cut the pieces I needed for the two shelves from the larger slab at the miter saw I squared up each end and then cut my shelves to length which ended up being about 24 inches each I've had this slab for over a year at this point and the bark is still holding on tight and I really liked the look of the slab with the bark on so I decided to leave it there was a small section of loose bark that I decided to reinforce with a little five-minute epoxy I just mixed it up filled the gap between the slab and the bark and clamped it in place I did this on the underside of the shelf so you won't see the epoxy in the final piece next I sanded the shelves working my way through the grits starting at 80 grit then moving to 120 grit after sanding with 120 I rounded over the edges of the shelves with an eighth inch radius round over bit and then finished sanding with 180 grit I like to use my round over bit right before my final sanding as it keeps the round over from being too affected by the sanding and also helps to remove any tool marks from the router for the finish on this project I use Danish oil now I just followed the instructions on the can flooding the surface and keeping the surface wet for the first coat the wood will absorb a ton of finish on the first coat - just make sure to stay close by and keep a flying finish once the wood stops absorbing the oil as quickly I let this first coat dry for about 30 minutes and then come back and do the same thing flooding the surface I let the second coat sit for about ten minutes and then wiped off any excess also make sure to lay your rags out to dry completely and unfold them before doing so if you can't do this outside on maybe your driveway somewhere that's concrete not flammable these folded rags with oil-based finish can actually spontaneously combust and you definitely don't want that to happen in a room full of sawdust and dry wood so I let the finish dry for about three days and lightly buffed out any surface imperfections with a thousand grit sanding pad and this left a really nice smooth matte finish which was exactly what I was looking for next it was time to mount the shelves the first set of brackets I tried were a metal kind of French cleat set that I found at my local Home Center these are designed for hanging picture frames and canvases and unfortunately it turned out that the bracket relied on being able to rest on the back of the piece to provide stability and my shelves just weren't thick enough I really wanted to get that floating look but this hardware just didn't work and I didn't have time to try any other options if you have a recommendation for another kind of floating hardware that would have worked in this project let me know in the comments section i found another set of more traditional brackets in my local home center and use them instead making sure the brackets were level and plumb last i attached the shelves to the brackets with a few one inch screws from below and they were done alright guys thank you so much for watching hopefully you enjoyed this project it was relatively simple but ended up being a little more complex than I initially expected it to be especially the little bit of a hiccup with the shelf brackets I was really hoping those floating brackets would work out if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and leave a comment telling me what you liked about the video it's very helpful for us also if you don't already go ahead and get subscribed we have new project videos every tuesday and new weekly maker roundups every Thursday and last if you want a little bit of a behind-the-scenes look at some of our projects and want to help support us check out our patreon page it's patreon.com slash crafted magazine alright guys I think that's going to do it thanks for watching and until next time happy building ",

        "content": "I am measuring my wall for feed board I'm going to cover the walls with beadboard and then put some shelves up this is a plywood beadboard purchase from my local lumberyard it's more rigid than the MDF stuff available at home improvement stores I marked my stud location on the countertop and ceiling before I covered the wall so I'd know where to shoot my nails I applied some caulk to the wall in my seam area to help adhere the smaller piece because there wasn't a stud behind it in which to nail I did nail it on the right side into the stud that was available the two ends of the beadboard form a half lap joint and the seam hides really well the beat board came primed so all I had to do was paint I'm using a high-gloss paint in my pantry I also needed to paint my face frames and do some touch-ups inside my cabinet this area looks very blue and I think it's because of the countertop that it's darker back here so hopefully when I put the light in up here it will look better and I'm gonna deal with that I'm just gonna keep moving ahead with what materials that I've currently got and floating shelves is what's on the agenda for today so that's what I'm doing getting these heavy four by eight sheets of plywood up onto my workbench is always quite a chore that requires a little creativity I've built a lot of floating shelves in my past and I've always used two by two as the ribs I'm trying something different this time and using 3/4 inch sanded ply on the vertical I ripped a ton of one and a half inch strips and then decided I needed to plan out exactly how many shelves I thought I wanted to build so I'm having a really hard time dissipating what I'm going to want to store on the shelves in here I don't want to waste space so I think I'm going to do is the first shelf and then work my way up because I want to visualize as I go what I want to do next I may have the shelves be different you know vary in height in between them yeah that's what I want to do I started out using pocket screws because I did not want to screw through the end grain on the one and a half inch strip but after the top rail was on I didn't have room to get the second set of screws driven in so I resorted to glue nails and screws through the face I shot two nails and put one screw into each side of each spine I built this first shelf only eight inches deep and I'm installing it at 20 inches above the finished countertop height once I have this shelf in place I decided I wanted the rest of the shelves to be 12 inches deep so I went down and made three more shelves I skipped the whole step of drilling all the useless pocket holes this time and just used glue nails and screws to secure these ribs together I used two spacer block to give me even spacing throughout the entire thing even though it's just a skeleton so who really cares I've built a total of four long shelf skeletons for the main wall and then four shorter ones that would go to the left of these making corner shelves of all of them it's just a lot of the same glue nail screw flip and repeat once I had all of the skeleton shelves built I took them out to the pantry and started installing them I measured the space in-between and secured each shelf with one screw I wanted to make sure I got the police met right before I worried about leveling I don't know that's not going to be very useful up there looking at this top shelf there's gonna be crown molding so I am a gain going to lower everything I'm gonna end up having some holes to patch but I think this will be better so I decided to undo all of the screws that I had secured and lower all of the shelves the bottom shelf I had actually leveled and secured in to all of the studs so I have a good amount of holes to patch the other shelves only had one screw each so it's not too bad I went ahead and leveled in every which way you can possibly level each shelf and secured them to the wall into every stud that they each hit for the corner shelves I clamped them to the existing shelf leveled them secure them to the wall and to the cabinet sometimes when I'm doing something that's easy I do it too fast and then I don't look at my notes and I made three of the longer shells instead through the short shelves so I just go and cut them down me too bad well I was hoping to be done today and it looks like it's gonna be one more week yeah there's a lot left to do so yeah alright bye guys see you next week ",

        "content": "a couple weeks ago I finished a project to build some floating so that my cats could access a high perch in the house that they jump up to anyway so I scoured the internet and came up with some plans I changed them a little bit and I'm going to do a walkthrough on how I built these this first video is just going to be laying out how I did it and what makes them up I might do a second video on how to actually build one for anybody that doesn't do much woodworking anybody that's used to doing this should be able to just see what I've done and build it to their own specifications the three shelves I put in one right there one there a top one and then that's the area that they've been accessing so I built a fourth shelf that's going to go right in this area just to make it easier for them to run up the shelves so let's do a walk through on what this is and we'll go from there so this is the shelf before it's mounted here's the front edge here's the back edge it is basically a hollow shelf there's nothing much to these to hang them a lot of floating shelves use a single cleat that they mount off the wall and they put the shelf in - what I did was I made an extended cleat and cats already checking it out this board mounts to the wall I'm mounting it I've pre-drilled it so that it can mount 16 inches on center and I made - or I made a series of 4 protrusions that'll stick into the Shelf to add some extra support and take some of the load I glued these I stapled them and then when everything was dry I drilled them and ran one screw into them I think they're strong enough to support anything that my cats will throw at it there or she's trying to throw stuff at it right now the Shelf dimensions are pretty simple the overall shelf is 21 and a half inches by 8 inches wide weight cat doesn't make this easy inside the shell I used one by two and it runs the entire perimeter of the inside of the shelf so the plywood is quarter-inch I just nailed the plywood nailed and stapled the sari glued and stapled the plywood to the 1 by 2 and then I put a finish board on the outside that I did miter cuts on and then I round my edges a little bit just because of cats jumping around it the carpets the same carpet I just put in my house it's stapled down except for this back edge because I want to put screws in this back edge to hold the shelf to the cleat so I'm going to mount this to the wall and get it attached okay here's the cleat installed on the wall it's ready it's good and solid I do have it four screws in two studs and I'm just going to slide the outer shell on it's on now these holes are not pre-drilled into the cleat yet take a drill bits bent but it'll be enough that hole is going to be a bit of a problem I'm probably hitting a staple underneath so I'll address that that one grabbed really good this one grabbed really good pull this one out and just move the whole over about 3/4 of an inch and that's addressed just pick up these little flakes of sawdust and I just need to grab the stapler attach the back of this carpet and we're done okay I'm ready to do the last bit and staple the back of the carpet done I already have my product tester sitting on it just going to meet with her approval I do have my supervisor sitting right there just watching the goings-on so let's get these final staples in and if the camera mount wobbles it's because cheetah is attacking a camera like come on get out of there okay these staples do ride up a little bit I'm going to push them in with a hammer but the idea is I want just enough that the cats can't work that edge up and peel it back so this will hold it good enough but also if I need to take the Shelf off to paint the wall which looks like it's coming soon I can still get this apart so the last shelf is on and done this part of the project is done so now I have I can get back far enough I have four shelves that let them get on top of the curio cabinet and then I also have an insert up there that's carpeted my plan is to eventually take shelves all the way up toward the peak come back down right along that window so that they can get down onto their tree stand right there between the two windows since these are the first ones I've made of this design I'm going to see how these hold up when I do the further up shelves I'm probably going to make the cleats out of oak so that I have a little bit camera doesn't want to focus so that I have a little bit stronger of a support since I sit right below that so if anybody wants to make one of these they're simple they really don't take a lot of time I think they look pretty decent feel free to enhance the design one thing I didn't mention during the construction is why I picked eight inches wide as you can see a cat's less than 8 inches wide I didn't want to go really wide because as they get toward the edge just the just that weight shift out toward the edge is going to put more stress on where the mount is along the wall Plus with these guys running around these I was worried that if I gave it too far out I was going to create too many forces and it was going to be harder to keep to the wall I just picked eight-inch because it looked aesthetically pleasing to me you can make that choice on your own if you build one well that's it for this project caps are already up and playing on it thanks for watching and if anybody has any questions you can leave a comment below or if you're in the Savannah group you can comment when I post this link thanks a lot bye ",

        "content": "today we're going to make a floating shelf let's build that start out by measuring and figuring out how big you need your shelf to be mine is going to hold these items here I started out by setting my width roughly the size I needed just so the plywood was manageable I ripped this down to about 7 inches I could then cut this in half to make the top and bottom of my shelf i'm making a four-foot shelf so the 8-foot sheet got cut in half to make my top and bottom I then set a 45 degree on my table saw and I ripped a 45-degree angled down one edge of the two top and bottom pieces once that 45 degree angle was cut I could then straighten my blade and cut the total width to six inches this will make the final width for my shelf this is the board I'm going to be used for my backing so I have about four inches to make the standoffs i'm going to set up a quick jig on my crosscut sled and i cut about nine standoffs four inches long out of this to buy one stock now I can minor each end of my top and bottom shelf to a 45 degree angle now we can use wood glue and Brad nails to anchor our standoffs in the corner of our top plate make sure that the piece is flush with the beveled edge and not the flat edge d left now i'm just going to tack it on with a couple brad nails while the glue dries i'm going to put one of these blocks on each end of my top plate it's very important that you line up these as close as you can to that minor because that will control how your edges will turn out on your final shell now that the front and back Ron I'm just going to anchor three more evenly spaced throughout the middle of my forefoot show now I'm going to put some glue on the standoffs and line up my top plate and bottom plate once these are all lined up I can clamp them in place and use Brad nails to tack everything together the final width of my shelf is two and a half inches I'm going to rip a three inch piece of plywood just to make it manageable now and can take the plywood and put a 45 degree bevel on one edge once the 45 degrees done I can mark my two and a half inch width and cut a 45 degree on the opposite side with the original cut facing the fence slowly nibble in and adjust your blade until you reach the width of two and a half inches this will make sure that your face of board will fit nicely in your shell once those 45s are cut we can then place it on our shelf and measure it should be at four feet but if you have a different shelf then you can make it whatever it is and cut to 45 bevels on each and making sure the front fascia lines up with the corners of these tops and bottoms now you can put the fascia and place apply some wood glue and tack it down with Brad nails with the leftover fascia scrap I'm just going to cut to end panels longer than six inches it's easier to cut them on the 45 and then measure the straight so I cut my 45 line it up and figure out where my backside which is a 90 degree cut will be now I can just cut those on the crosscut sled get using glue and Brad nails again we're going to anchor the end cap in place making sure you line up all your edges to get it as clean as possible to make your mounting bracket you're going to cut some stock four inches shorter than your overall shell plane I'm then going to attach the remaining stocks would cut earlier to each end and two equally spaced between the end I'm just using wood glue and one brad nail to tack these in place we can now pre drill two holes in each piece and anchor it with wood screws this will give it more strength than just the glue and the brad all together it'll make for a strong bracket now we can take some wood putty and fill in all our holes and all our seams make sure this putty is sandable and stainable if you plan on staining and not painting your shell once the fillers dry you can sand your shelf with an orbital sander or a handstand or whatever you have you just want to smooth out everything now i'm just applying a coat of stain to my shelf you could also paint it if you want it I just like to look a stained wood once it's dry it's time to hang it up to mount your shelf you're going to mount the bracket we built to the wall with a four-foot shelf you should be able to get three studs so I'm just measuring where my first stud is and anchoring it now I can use my level to find the other two studs and put those screws in with the Shelf being level this will anchor that bracket to the wall and make it very secure so it won't fall off a lot stronger than keyhole slots now you can take your shelf box and line up all the standoffs and smack your shelf lon mine was a pretty tight fit if yours isn't then you can easily just throw one screw up inside just to keep it from sliding off now you put all your decorations up on the shelf and stand back and admire your work so I hope you guys liked this project I hope it gave you some inspiration for something you can do in your house if you want a floating shelf this is a really nice way to do it gives you a good look without brackets and it's a lot stronger than just a standard off-the-shelf cat no pun intended off-the-shelf keyhole style mounting floating shelf you can put a lot more weight on these so if you like the project give it a thumbs up don't forget to share it with your friends and if you have any questions leave a comment if you want to see more videos like this feel free to subscribe to my channel you and I DIY I try and post here every Wednesday so thanks for watching thanks for coming out and I'll see you guys on the next project ",

        "content": "well the folks over at remodel a holic comm contacted me about featuring and inside the door shelving unit that I've built for my laundry room now this was one of the very first projects that I did and before I started making videos so today I'm going to go ahead and build a second one on the inside of my shop door so that I can video the process now just because I'm putting it on a shop door keep in mind that you can very easily put this on whatever door you personally need it now this idea originally came from Anna White and I just adapted it to my needs and something to note is my doors are solid core doors meaning the inside is not hollow so imma be mounting my unit directly to the door however if you have more modern hollow core doors but be sure to check out anna's tutorial because she has a different method of mounting the unit to the door so I'm gonna get started I started this project by buying a piece of 3/4 inch plywood then using a temporary fence I cut it into seven inch strips now this does leave one board leftover that's not quite 7 inches however there's still we used for it later on I took two of the boards and cut them to length using the miter saw this will create the sides I took the cut offs from this as well as a whole nother board then use a stop block at the miter saw to cut up what will become all the shelves then using the same stop block setup I grab the board that was not quite seven inches and also cut it into pieces I took these to the tables all to rip down to one and a half inches with everything cut I started laying out marks for my pocket holes then stuck each piece of my jig and drill them out now before assembling I went ahead and gave everything a coat of primer let that dry and then came back and gave it a coat of paint with everything dry I started assembling it by putting on the bottom shelf first as you see I did not paint the inside because glue sticks better to an unpainted surface so to put on my shelves I would first measure where I wanted them clamp it down and then just screw them into place with the one side attached I went through and put glue on every end of the shelves then clamped on the second side then I stirred it up upside down to make attaching the shelves easier I would first make sure that the shelf was level then clamp it down and screw it in place then I went through and painted the inside when that was done drawing I flipped a unit right-side up and then started attaching those front bars since my color is our grand green I went ahead and came back with a green accent okay now I moved it into place using two by fours on the ground to act as spacers I made sure it was level then use the pocket holes that I drilled earlier to attach it to the door after loading it down I realized that screw boxes could actually fit on the side without interfering with the door shutting so I went ahead and added a few just to utilize some wasted space so this is a very easy project that will give you additional storage on whatever door you may need it for now something to note my door here has three hinges and since it's a shop there are actually commercial sized hinges but when I did this in my laundry room there were only two so I actually added a third one and also upgraded them to four inches because this is adding a considerable amount of weight to the door so keep that in mind if you tackle this project now I do have a set of downloadable plans on my website which is what conveys calm there's also a link in the description of the video for you and if you use the same dimensions that I use you can actually get two of these units from one sheet of plywood so if you wanted one for both doors then all you would need is one sheet of plywood so I hope that that's helpful and I would love to hear your comments of course below and I'll see you next time ",

        "content": "today I want to be showing you how to make this floating shelf decor inspired by Urban Outfitters supplies needed for this project mug and cup hooks sandpaper plywood hemp or jute cord scissors and optional markers with your plywood you're going to have to cut it into three shapes I did rectangles the diameters I used for my for the smaller piece I use six inches by eight inches the medium piece eight inches by 10 inches and the larger piece eight inches by 12 inches you can do this according to your liking there's really no right or wrong in this just keep in mind what do the Shelf is gonna be holding and how much space you need according to that now after you take your plywood and cut it I use hand a handsaw you can use electrical saw if you're really handy with that or ask for help if you really dumb no clue what you're doing I'm gonna take the sandpaper and sand the edges off because when I went a handsaw the plywood it was really really like rough up ends and there are some pieces coming off so use sandpaper just to smoothen out the edges now this is gonna take a while so I would probably have something on Netflix going on YouTube I don't know somebody in the background cuz it's gonna take a while now that you have your pieces all smoothed out this is optional I took a silver marker and ended up coloring the edges to make them pop a little bit more you don't have to you can use paint I just have the marker lying around so I decided to use it you do whatever you like you can keep it the way it is it's all up to you now after you're done with whatever options that you'd like to decorate your board with or if you want to decorate your board you're going to take one of the mug hooks and then it's the smaller hooks and you can either use the eye hook also the ones where it's all the way car backs into the screw Minds are halfway open I already had these lying around so instead of buying the eye hook I just ended up using these I prefer if you use the eye hook now you can simply try to attach the hook onto the plywood by banging it just a little bit just to give it a little dent and make it easier for it to screw in I actually ended up taking a nail and creating a bigger hole so it was so much simpler to screw in because the first way was taking way too long and you can see how simple it is after I did that now you're gonna do that with all your boards next I'm going to take this jute I think that's how you pronounce it Korg or you can take em cord I have used that to something really sturdy that will hold not only your shelves but also the items that are on it now I'm gonna take this cut a little bit cut about I think I ended up using a foot and a half or this part of the project you can do little or more if you'd like I think one and a half is good enough and then what you're gonna do is take the cord and tie it around the hooks when I did a double knot on these and you just do that throughout the whole entire board now ended up using the first string as of a main measurement and just use that just to simply align the rest of the corners just make sure there are equal lengths as I know the quarry I would advise to do a double knot and then you're going to take another piece of cord and this I did about this was about 24 inches so what I did here is I tied it with the four cords that I used for the hooks and then I'm gonna wrap it around now you want to make sure that everything is screwed on tightly and the knots are knotted very well and what I did was use my hand as a pressure point into the middle of the board and just make sure that my weight of my hand was being applied well enough that that nothing was coming undone now by doing this it gave more of a cleaner look so all the strings weren't hanging out so yeah I would have eyes to wrap it around your cords just to give a more a cleaner look I'm showing you here is that I wrapped it around and I gave it enough space for the string to go through the hole right there to create another knot and that's just gonna finish off the whole spiral next step is to take one of the hooks and screw it on to your ceiling I advise you to be cautious on the kind of ceiling that you guys have just because it could either be drywall or there could be wedding that can get in your way next you're gonna make a knot and don't tighten it all the way just just leave enough space so you can wrap it around the hook and then take a little tug just to make sure that nothing's gonna come off and yeah I'm so excited now you can keep doing this readjusting and as many times as you like until you feel like it's suited right for your taste now you're gonna do this wine F two and three times and this is the finish outcome this was inspired by the Urban Outfitters loading shelf it was way too costly and I noticed that it was looked pretty simple to do and so I did it and it was really simple and very affordable so this is actually one of my favorite pieces in my room right now so I hope you guys enjoy this also if you try this out let me know I hope you guys have a great day and thanks for hanging out with me today and I'll see you guys next time bye for the first project words make a bookshelf using ",

        "content": "what's up youtube this is LDS reliance does this look like your garage just stuff everywhere don't don't mind that but just there's none there's never enough room in a garage for building things and for organizational purposes so today I wanted to do a video and kind of show you a solution that I'm working on as you can see I've already started trying to paint the garage and make this a little bit nicer and more organized so what I did was I started with a French cleat system and basically what that consists of is these 45-degree angled cuts allow you to put the opposite piece the the opposite 45-degree cut attach it to the back of shelves or containers or whatever you've got and it creates a nice modular system for storing tools and supplies as you can see I've got all my screws and nails glue sealant so forth over here got a bunch of paint and stain and spray cans and so forth and then all my big gallon cans down there anyway it's a great way to get to get organizing and improve your storage so today what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you another piece that I'm building just just to kind of show you how easy this is is a do-it-yourself project but I've gone ahead and cut some some pieces too for the the side pieces for this for this next shelf and you can make it any dimension so it doesn't really matter what I cut it to or how I build this I just want to show you how easy it is to make this and how cool it is and how how flexible it is so I'm going to take these boards out and we'll get started making another shell so here we have the materials that we're going to need first up I have these two pieces of 2 feet by 4 feet OSB these are sold it's your big box Home Depot or Lowe's or whatever you've got as attic decking they're sold exactly as is their tongue and groove so one side will have a groove the other side will have a tongue and they slide together to lock in place which is really nice I just happen to have these left over front for something from something else if you've got plywood or something leftover that you want to use that's perfect I just happen to have these I wouldn't recommend using these going out and purchasing these for this type of project but I just happen to have them and they're going to work fine for the this this will provide the back so it's going to be 4 feet by 4 feet then these I cut these to 11 inches wide so again it doesn't matter I just wanted to be able to hang tools on this so my tool cases though the widest one was was about 11 inches so that's the the width I chose to cut them and so what I'm going to be doing is using my miter saw I'm going to cut these two lengths so obviously there's going to be a ring you know the outside edge is going to be boxed in and then in the middle I'm actually going to cut across this seam in the middle there's going to be two shelf so it'll be a total of three shelves where I can put things such as my my tool power tool boxes and chests that's what this is primarily going to be for so it needs to be it needs to be able to handle a lot of weight and and it needs to be big so that's why we have that now these these French cleats that I created and and attached to the wall they have they are each I've got them screwed in with heavy-duty screws in every stud I believe these were 16 inch on center so this is going to be able to hold a ton of weight and I'm going to make use of two of these I don't care emit like I haven't decided what which one I'm going to use but either this bottom one in the middle one or the middle one and the top row so I'll have they'll be clamped onto two of these cleats for extra support okay so I've got the bottom piece cut and once again with as with a lot of my projects I'm going to use a Kreg jig so that I can drill some holes on the bottom two pocket holes that will be hidden underneath and drill into the side boards on either side so I'm going to drill probably three pocket holes on each side all right got all the pieces glued and screwed together you'll notice the pocket holes on the bottom where they're screwed in at an angle so you won't be able to see that from the front or from the top and I'm going to let the glue dry for a couple hours and then we're going to glue it and screw it to the the back support or the back piece okay so now what I've done I've after this is try to carefully put this on top of the shelf and I'm going in with screws as you can see I've started here and screwing around the outside edges and then I'm going to measure where this the two shelves are in there and and put a row of screws as well just to hold give some extra support to the shelves okay now I've got the piece of French cleat that I've cut in the past as you can see it's got the 45 degree angle on the end there so what I need to do now is measure where I want the piece and then cut this to length so that it goes across the back and then so cut it to length and then screw and glue it to the back okay we got it screwed in there so obviously the cleat part points downward so this will be the bottom of the cabinet shelf whatever you want to call this so I put plenty of screws in it as you can see put glue on the other side so I'm going to let this dry for a couple hours and then I'm going to hang it up right over there and it should fit perfectly over there okay there we go we got it finished and hung up there sorry for the poor lighting but it's getting dark and it looks good I'll paint it white eventually to match everything else and it's going to hold all of my tool boxes tool carrying cases where we call him and then some so anyway this was a very easy project I use scraps that I had laying around and it took me probably continuously about an hour an hour and a half of labor a lot of the time was spent trying to capture this video and waiting for glue to dry so really really easy project just wanted to show off what you can do and when you want to move this stuff around you just lift it off of the wall and rearrange it that's the beauty of a French cleat system you don't you're not locked into some permanent thing where you've got it you know screwed or or anchored into the wall permanently so I really like these I encourage everyone to check them out and give them a try and thanks for watching guys ",

        "original_title": "Build Simple Floating Shelves",
        "content": "hey guys my name is Chris and today on the goofs inside YouTube channel we are making some floating shelves that's right floating shows that are the strongest ever right at least in our opinion anyway so there's no hardware required they're all made from ready available materials and let's see how we got it done let's go all right well let's get started guys like always thank you for joining me today we're going to make these floating shelves out of primarily Baltic birch plywood this stock is three quarters of an inch thick and I'm going to rip it down on the table tall here's a two and a half inch strip so as you can tell by the title of this video this is the absolute strongest way I have found to make these floating shelves I've made quite a few sets of these in my lifetime and I decided to make a video and document and tell you guys just how I get this done then I promise you guys your patience will be rewarded at the end of this video I'm going to share with you the technique and how I make these floating shelves stay level their entire lifetime all right now making my way to the crosscut sled I go ahead and set up a stop block to cut these pieces to length my client wanted 60 inch shelves that way I'm cutting these pieces into 56 inch strips here I joined them together to double them up these are going to be part of the bracket so they're going to stick out of the wall that are going to hold the shelf in place and unfortunately as I'm filming this my camera dies but I made a makeshift diagram of how these things are made basically you do a series of layers with this plywood and the brackets themselves that stick out at 90 degrees to create mortise and tenon joints all throughout this is a small version but you get the gist and you're going to see these later in the video as well now I'm kind of confused if I would into the strips that are going to become the bottom in the tops of the floating shelves themselves [Music] here are the pieces that are going to be the skeletal structure that are going to be inside the shelves that are going to go in between the brackets that I made earlier as you can see I line up the brackets make my marks make sure it fits grab a little wood glue and make some square marks on there making sure these are ninety degrees to each edge and glue them in wait about five minutes let that glue it here go ahead and glue on the top and mail it all in place once that shelf is put together I go ahead and test the bracket looks like I've got a nice snug fit very happy with how this is turning out at this point I go ahead and rip up some poplar to be the right width and then I cut each piece the links these are going to be the trim pieces that are going to cover the edges in the front of the shelf itself it's real simple installation little bit of glue little bit of grind nails no big deal now as I'm installing this front piece of trim I go ahead and make sure to line up just right and be careful here you don't want to have any blowout with your nail gun so keep your nail gun perpendicular to the length of the piece just like that everything is looking good with all four shelves completed I go ahead and run through the grits from 120 to 180 to 220 and then put a nice hand chamfer on all the pieces here giving it a nice finished look I do want to tell you that at this point my client did give me creative control he wanted it to be rustic any one of these shelves to be dark and I asked him what kind of stain you won and he didn't say so he gave me creative control to try something new so guess what we're going to torch it as I go ahead and start this process I realize this is good to take forever so I decided to bring out the big guns here and guess what it worked extremely well sort of more of that in a minute so I got this big propane torch out to make quick work of this I go ahead and take light passes on each side torching this thing up nice and dark I go ahead and finish each piece once they've cooled down with a little bit of poly acrylic and things are looking good man let me check this out no stain no nothing those things are looking awesome however disaster I come out in a few hours and applies the delaminated from the plywood creating these awful looking bubbles I am so set at this point my wife comes out and sees that I'm upset and she's like hey don't despair I have an idea I was going to call a client tell him hey we're done I got to remake the sisters crazy but she gave me besides she's going to take it off use screwdriver breaking this was painful guys I'm not gonna lie to you taking all this time and all this labor do all this and this boom I had to just strip it down to the core again you know what I wasn't a believer but I went ahead and did it so what i'm doing here is i'm essentially sanding down where the pieces are delaminated right to where the adhesions still fixed apply it to the board creating this kind of well I think it was pretty awful but again my wife and her creative mind she says go ahead and just some of that dark stain you have and let's get this done so as I'm looking at this I maybe kind of see the light again the tone I go ahead and apply the same and I'm thinking sitting to back now check this out it's almost looks like we did this on purpose okay so essentially we delaminated applied we have a little bit of brown a little bit of black little dark I think it looks pretty cool now the beauty of it is is after I put some spray lacquer on these I decided to change the finish at the last minute my client at the end of the day lovely this looks freaking off well now that we're looking tragedy has been avoided we go ahead and put some copper first X on the end three in total on each side giving it a nice look now I made this frame off-camera but let me show you how I did it with this demonstration I took strips of plywood one strip of three inches one strip of three and a half inches essentially if you join them together creating a half lap at the 90s you also create a rabbit that the mirror can rest there this was a cool technique and it worked out really well and I'm really happy with how this turned out at this point I break out this carpeted piece of plywood that I got it used for when I want to finish something off and I don't want to Mar the surface so I put a piece of 8-inch backer board on this mirror and then attach it with some finish nails just like this turns out pretty nice this mirror actually one of my favorite pieces I made in the whole drill now to go ahead and finish this thing off we used some furniture tax as well but this time I'm going to go ahead and use the ones that are black and colored a little contrast but it's kind of the same thickness now it's time for installation now pay close attention because this is how these sills are going to stay level their entire life you install these with five and a half inch lag screws in the top portion of the bracket what that does is it puts pressure on the shelves to be upward just a little bit by one or two degrees when you install the shelf you're essentially put weight on it and it stays level for its entire life it will not sag below 90 I promise that and just like that you slide the shelves on look at my tonight at this point the installation is coming together pretty well you can see there in the corner let me show you what that is that's a small frame that's been lagged into the corner stud as well and it's small floating skills to go over that because you know he wants a place to put his speaker now also this is a technique I use when I'm hanging something really heavy this mirror is probably about 80 pounds and I like using two drywall anchors if I can't go into the stud because two seems to give it a little bit more rigidity in staying level and there you go guys the installation was a success and I really want to thank my client for allowing me the opportunity to make this for him he loved it and that makes all the difference in the world when your clients happy I'm happy thank you so much guys also one last look at the floating shelves in this man cave I really love how they turned out hey guys thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed the content we always advise you to subscribe over there there's other videos

        "content": "hey I'm Bob and I like to make stuff today we're going to make some inset floating shelves one thing Volusion for sponsoring this video Volusion has an all-in-one ecommerce solution if you want to start an online store they have all the tools you need to do it both they can help you build the site and they have a bunch of educational materials to help you get a business started Volusion is doing a really cool thing right now called stores and stripes it's for active US military spouses and veterans it's a way for you to get a business off the ground for $1 for a year you get an e-commerce store all the support all that stuff you give a $1 donation to Operation Homefront and they'll get you going be sure to check out Volusion thanks for sponsoring this video let's get to the shelves I had some friends who wanted some floating shelves that look like they were made out of a thick beam about two and a half inches I started with 1 by 12 pine for the top and the bottom but you could also use plywood for this for the faces I wanted to use pallet wood since it was going to be kind of a rustic look overall I trimmed off one end and then cut it to length and on the table saw I ran it through just to knock off one rough edge then I ripped down three pieces at two and a half inches to make the face of each one of the shelves to match the thickness of the face I needed to add some filler to the inside of the shelves I cut down some 3/4 inch pine down into strips of about 1 inch thick I cut down enough to be able to chop down sections so that I could put four sections inside of each one of the shelves then I just added some glue and laid them out they don't have to be placed very specifically here they just can't be on the ends I held them in place with Brad nails and then add a glue to the other side then I laid on the top panel to make sure that all the front faces were aligned I connected it all together with some Brad nails cover it all the front faces with glue and then added my actual shelf face I use lots of Brad nails to hold this in place this whole thing is going to look very rustic and it's going to be stained and so kind of the more damage you do at this point the more realistic it looks I used a rasp so just tear up this clean edge that I gotten from the table saw I made a lot of dents and scratches and just kind of mess it up on purpose and then I went back with an orbital sander and smoothed it out I left some of the dents and the imperfections there but I got rid of anything that would hurt you if you touched it and my friends wanted a really dark stain for this and I was hesitant at first but it ended up turning out really cool it blended the different types of wood together between the pine and whatever it was on the face from the pallet and I thought it worked out pretty well I'm not a big fan of staining usually but I like the way that these look the last thing to make were two more strips of pine for each one of the shelves then it was time for install we marked the center point for each one of the shelves I finally got to try out this new laser level from Leica I made my marks and lined up the laser with it and that made it super easy to transfer those marks to both sides of this inset normally an inset like this would be kind of a pain to get everything level but this device was really nice I'll put a link to it down in the description for each one of the brackets I transfer the marks on to a piece of pine and then I drilled a hole right through the center of it I made sure to transfer these so that I didn't accidentally drill through any grout lines I wanted to make sure I was drilling into brick I drilled the holes with a masonry bit and then I attached the bracket with some tapcon screws make sure you use the right size bit for the screws that you have the opposite side was drywall and I did basically the same process but I used the pine to drill some pilot holes then I used a bigger bit to make holes big enough for the anchors that I was going to use these anchors hold about a hundred pounds of piece so between two of them on one side and the brick on the other side these shelves will be plenty strong then I screwed the brackets right into the anchors each one of the shelves just slides right onto the brackets they were a little tight which is a good thing and I had to kind of jam them in place but that made it so that there were no gaps on the outsides if yours weren't so tight you could run a small screw down through the top of each shelf into the bracket to secure it so that's about it they're really easy to make in the size and shape don't really matter very much you could make these a lot thicker if you wanted to you could even make them skinnier if you really wanted to the big thing is making sure you have a strong enough cleat on the side to hold up the shelf and whatever weight you're going to put on top of it I hope you liked this one and if you did let me know in the comments down below or at I like to make stuff calm I'd love to see some stuff that you were working on so please share it with me on any of the social networks I've got a lot more projects and playlists and stuff for you to check out as well as a couple of other types of floating shelves if you like these videos and you want to help support what I'm doing

        "content": "[Music] hi guys it's drew and this is my first DIY video we're going to be making a hanging shelf you can see it there let's get started what you're going to need pretty simple you just need two pieces of wood a wood saw textured spray paint black spray paint paint measure ruler pencil paper just write down some measurements yarn hammer and two nails literally that's it's so simple it literally cost me like ten dollars so let's get started alright the first thing you're going to do is get measurements I was just measuring my wall as you can see me there and then I just wrote down stuff on my pencil paper that's why I said you need two different measurements the from literally all in uniform then I walked over to my workspace I just laid out my stuff and set up my camera and got to move the project so let's actually start so that I just got my tape measure and measure down the piece of wood where I was going to do the cut also while you're cutting be very careful it's a sharp thing I feel like an adult saying this but you really need to have an adult like this was a dangerous cult like this saw was like actually really scary and I should not have been using it on this piece of wood to actually get a real saw and actually cut the wood right so I cut mine to 15 inches obviously yours was going to be different because it's your shelf but I did 15 and I you can see me and I'm just struggling there and it's kind of embarrassing but the third time I saw was two days week you can see there it was a scary time it broke the wood and the I think of woods problem and the sauce problem at the same time so like get a real soft don't follow my example that was a very bad saw you can see I'm literally struggling so hard to get this thing off like it was so annoying and I was like trying to break it it was like all my Jesus but yeah when I finally got it I just kind of stopped it for a minute to contemplate my life no but actually for something ah there's the worldcat for the side make sure you close it you don't step on it and kill yourself because literally that was very scary saw and I'm pretty sure your saw will be scary too not that scary though so then after that I got my other piece of wood and measured it cut it and got to painting you're going to want to take your textured spray paint and make sure you shake it like if you don't shake it the texture is not going to like mix well and it's going to look really really bad then evenly going back and forth just go on the wood and get an even texture make sure you cover it fully so you don't really see the wood unless you are going for that like distress the fat I went for a full cover that's and ends up looking distressed samer another piece but um yeah just go over it like that and just yeah cover the entire thing and don't make it ripley like I did I literally was way too close to the void after that chunk dries just get like one of the sides though you like have more than one side drying at the same time after that I just went inside for like two hours check the paint afterwards cousin realized I should have been doing it on not dirt and got a ton of stuff oh okay oh my gosh don't be me actually we get a workspace and then I got those spray paint and sprayed the other side a little annoyed all the clips got deleted of me doing the other piece of wood and the other side of the piece of wood so bear with me just spray them it's not that hard I assure you next take your yarn and measure it around your piece of wood you're going to want to have to perfectly the same groups and make sure that they're perfectly the same like if they're not your shelfs not going to be even and it's not going to look that great I assure you like that make sure you do this twice because there's two shelves next you're going to take your black spray paint and spray the yarn just get like the main coat over and make sure you're working on the surface I finally got one it's just like an old plastic tablecloth so just spray the yarn until it's black the reason I chose to do white yarn the black spray paint if so could have this really nice ombre look so it isn't just straight black it looks like grey and some spots and black and some spots then hang it on something and just spray the parts that didn't get sprayed so it ends up looking like that well you wait for this dry you're going to want to put your nails into your walls you know exactly where your shelves are going to be going so I did one down low like this and waited to do the other one so that I could place it correctly after the other one is up and I saw how it looked then reattach the strings the shelf and then I just hung it up and it was really simple I just made it even now there's this trick on iPhone where if you open the compass app and then just swipe to the right like you would swipe to the next page of apps you actually get this level and it's really awesome it's like interactive and it changes colors to help whenever you're perfect so I just use that and make sure my shelf is perfect as you can see it can hold a lot of weight while I'm putting any other nail into the wall you can see I put my succulent planters my keys and some sunglasses on there and it doesn't seem fazed at all it just holds it and yeah then I got my other shelf and just hung it up above the other one so they're in like a diagonal pattern and it looks really awesome then I got the leveling app on my iPhone and just made sure that the second shelf is perfect as well after I leveled it I just put on a speaker a little faith candle and a bottle of lotion on the shelf and it held so yeah and then you're done that's it for this video thank you for watching please like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video bye ",

        "content": "hey youtube sam here i'm making some shelves for my daughter's room forgetting a piano when my grandma's old piano we're actually getting that for her and from my sister and we're putting that in her room anyhow and in the process of that we got to move some stuff around she had a shelf that she has a snow globe collection and that's gotta move so I'm building a shelf that can go up on her wall to hold her snow globes this is a shelf that I actually me and my wife have a shot gun shot gun shot glass collection in our room and I built this years and years ago it's basically just a two by two cheap cheapest straightest two by twos I could find and in our shot glass for a shot glass collection we found some actual molding like you put around your room just the baseboard molding type stuff it was actually like three inches but it was super cheap so I went ahead and bought that and we have it actually going all the way around our room my daughter's room were just doing it on one wall and anyway and then for her shelving unit part it needed to be at least five inches so I actually found a board that was five inches by I don't know how long bits but you can use whatever you want as far as the shelving part as long as you need then fairly thin shelves this will hold up great and we've had it in our room for years several several years anyhow so you get some two by two straight as you can and I need a certain length you guys are going to obviously need your own length but i'm going to show you a way to kind of measure something out you know it's one of those little saves you a little bit of time makes a little bit easier don't have to do the math kind of thing and i will set you up for that alright so this is what i did i took one board here put the board side by side on my table here and on this board then i'm going to use the whole thing out i put the tape measure on the end of that and then strung it next to this board all the way out till they meet then I need 118 118 and a half actually I think I need 119 and a half ought to figure that out before I do this imagine replace got once yet again anyway I'll figure that out but what I did was just kind of went from nano one out to the other and i'll show you what i do after that so it was 118 and a half so i got that measured out here then what I'll do is at the end of this board where I need a little bit longer I'm just going to put the mark there then I know where to cut my board out but it up against here and I have the length that I need just a little bit of a trick there that makes a little easier don't have to do math don't have to do quite as much measurements but works well i'm going to make our cut here this idle line because I want this whole piece here using my miter saw my barbecue table I got a video about that if you're interested we'll check it out another harbor freight not the delta sign up late not a pretty good leg cuts pretty good too all right let me show you a little trick on something you might know my not we'll see i'm going to drill out this board I'm screwing in just so we don't split things when I get it inside to screw it into the wall but something to find a center point some of you may or may not know this but will hopefully show somebody who doesn't she bring this down and give it a little bit of Mark there bring it down give it a little mark there I already did this so I'm dead center and it's hitting the same spot but if you were if you had a mark here and a mark here split the difference kind of thing so that way you know your Center if you're splitting if you're going one way bring it down hit a mark and other way smack on the same mark you know your Center just a little tip and trick there well I probably should measure this out and get them all right but as long as they're centered on okay i'm planning on putting the way more screws than I need in this thing just to make sure we don't lose any snow globes and I'm sure I'll find several studs if not I'll drill an extra roll to finest I got to go through do the long one there but I don't figure you're going to want to watch all that and I need to cut my 5-inch board down to the same length just like I did the other board and I'm also going to drill well I'll show you that a little bit i'm back at the table here this will kind of give you a little bit idea of what my plan is this is going to be attached to the wall like that this board is going to sit on top and then i'm going to screw in to that board that kind of gives it a not really floating shelf look but kind of a similar type idea it's you can obviously see that it's attached to this board but it's you know doesn't hang out the room doesn't have big giant angles but it holds you know I don't know I'm not going to give you a weight on it but it holds a decent enough weight if you just have like a little collection going around your room and and these are going to go pretty high up on the law I'll show it to you when it's all done something i'm going to do too is I know that's about in the center of that so I'm going to actually put this here and drill holes all the way down the board so that I can screw into those under this and hopefully have a nice little sturdy shelf but this is actually the cutoff piece so I don't want to drilling holes in it and it just gives you an idea you know hold no hard anyhow that's kind of the basic idea and i'll show you when it's all up and ready to roll all right there's the one I built for the video and here's the other two right here in the middle civic nak shelves they're pretty simple easy thing to do it's just basically an L on the wall that they're pretty strong riester d I'm not worried about them shaking so much that things come down or anything like that in fact we've got a couple doors so you know we'll keep an eye on them make sure nothing rattles too far out of whack but as you can see you can put a lot of stuff on them lots of knickknacks and they look pretty alright it again my daughter's going to take all this back down and paint it one of these days because it's just raw wood right now but you know I probably have a grand total of I don't know less than 20 bucks and all this stuff right here I'm pretty positive probably quite a bit less than 20 bucks in ended up getting united by a couple more two by twos for these and I actually made these shelves not sure exactly what they are the top bone is five so these are like maybe six or eight look like about eight inches out and they still hold perfectly fine a real sturdy NRL's I'd go a whole lot bigger than this and I wouldn't put probably real heavy books or anything on it look knickknacks or troll well so this is Sam jack of all Master none it all have a good one ",

        "content": "for a while now I've wanted to make a sunglasses holder so that I don't have to have these sunglasses on my bedside table which takes up a lot of space and I didn't really have any other place to put them now for a while i was thinking of all these different complicated ways to hold my sunglasses and recently I came along matt crowe Moniz video on his floating shelf that he made and I thought that would be a great way to store my sunglasses so I ended up making one of those myself and not with one piece of wood but with three different pieces I used walnut oak and cherry and it seemed turn out pretty good so let's go through the steps and show you how to make this I'm going to start by cutting this piece down so I can run it through the planer alright so now what i've done is i just trimmed down this piece of oak and this piece of walnut to fit better with this piece of cherry and then I glued and clamped everything up and I'm basically just going to wait for this to dry until we can move on to the next step all right and after cleaning up both of the sides i ended up cutting this to final length now it doesn't really matter the length just whatever or whatever length shelf you want and so next I'm going to write out the cavity in the back to hold this on a French cleat system now here would have done is I've set up the router table to cut this section out in the back of the shelf here so that I can put the French cleats now I would do this with the router out of the router table however I don't have an edge guide for my router so it's easier for me to do it in the table with a fence and a couple marks for where I start and stop alright so I've got this cavity here cut out and I clean this side up a little bit and still working on this side here but basically this is where the French cleat is going to go and it's going to be two small pieces of plywood in here and so basically I just need to finish cleaning this up and then we could put one of the sides of the French cleat in here right so what I've done here is cut out of French cleat and it's pretty simple this piece is just three quarter by three quarter and it's the depth of and three quarter is also the depth of this slot here and so this piece will fit in like this and then I cut this bottom piece right here and this will fit in like that to hold this against the wall now it sticks up just a tiny bit so I'm going to have to sand that down but it's enough so that i can just sand it down afterwards and it should be pretty good and it should fit nice and snug against the wall so i'll go ahead and glue this top piece in now alright so after i finished gluing that back piece in there or the back French cleat what I did is I ended up standing this down and I also put a little champ around the edges just with the hand plane and I didn't really want much of a profile but the little chamfer looks pretty good and now i'm just applying a coat of wipe on poly urethane all right so right here you can see I've put a French cleat on the wall and this is just a little bit over 16 inches so I was able to get two screws one in each of the studs so this is on here nice and secure and now what I can do is just simply slide the shelf on and I can also move this left to right so that I can Center it on the wall or in between two things on the wall and it seems to work pretty good alright and that wraps up the floating shelf project this looks really nice I am really happy with how it came out and I might also make another one of these for downstairs because it just looks so nice now also the French cleat in the back is kind of cool because you can move it back and forth as you please so you can make fine adjustments to it once you hang it and I'm again I'm really happy with it if you liked this project please click the like button below and also subscribe to my channel thanks for watching ",

        "content": "hey there guys welcome back today I'm going to be working on yet another pallet project but hopefully this one's going to be a little bit cooler than the rest what I want to do is build a picture show you know that looks nice to put pictures on but I want to have it have an added feature of a hidden compartment either off the bottom or one of the sides and what I want to do with the compartment is put like a whiskey or a wine bottle and make some glasses in kind of an homage to the speakeasies of the Prohibition days I've always found that era very interesting and the ingenuity of the people interesting to hide things and have little secret levers and different things like that so that's what I want to do so I finally acquired some nice really nice straight pallet pieces obviously they have the normal pallet holes and stuff but as far as straight and true they're about as good as I can get four pallets so basically let me take this to the saw I'm going to build a box kind of format and then I'm going to kind of see what my method to get to my secret compartments going to be so give me a few minutes and we'll see if we can get turned out you now that the pieces are cut out I'll kind of show you my my thinking behind this basically we're going to go for just a block mantle style shelf but basically I kept one piece just the the standard pallet piece and that's going to you know I just kept that just has a nice traditional pallet look a couple holes on the front so this is going to act as the front of the shelf right here is going to act as the back as you'll know that's I ripped that down just to compensate for the roof here and then I also use some pieces of the same width to make the sides so these are going to be the sides and all of this is going to get glued and nailed together and then this piece is going to be the top which is going to leave us that cavity underneath for our flip out shelf all of this once I get it sanded and glued is going to be stained to kind of give it more of a consistent look and then I still need to figure out some sort of fancy little mechanism to open the shelf but let me get this put together and then we'll get on to the mechanism Oh you so the sanding is done and you'll see it looks quite a bit different than what it did with that grade pallet wood this was actually a big surprise to me the the difference of it was just pretty much the same gray color when I sanded it it really brought out I guess the natural tones in the wood not a big deal I think once we put some stain on it it's going to blend it all in but you know hopefully give it that rustic look but so far I'm liking it and you know I'm just going to leave those nails in there because I think it adds a little character but for the bottom and basically this is where the prohibition thing portion is going to be I just did just cut out a simple little piece to fit in there I'm not sure if I'm going to use hinges but you'll notice one side I have angled a little bit and that's basically just to show that you know once I get some hinges or however I'm going to do this for pivoting that lead edge is not going to rub when it closes so again this is going to be on the bottom like this and then that door is going to open from the bottom so not sure if I'm going to do hinges or not hopefully if I do they're not going to really poke out too much but maybe I'll come up with something else so I'm going to take it and stain it right now and then we'll see how it looks after that you so I'm finally down to figuring out what I was going to do for my little bottom hatch door here off the bottom of this and I've decided to you to go with little hinges I was looking around into my tools and I found this old skill a drill bit Forster bit box and it had really really nice small slim low-profile hinges so basically what I've done is just chiseled out a little recessed edge and basically if you look underneath it you're gonna be able to see the hinges but once it's in there it should fit flush down to where you know unless you're three and a half feet tall you're probably not going to see it real easy so let me get these installed and and then I'll get to working on the hidden latch piece now we've got the hinges installed I'll let you see them on the bottom there I think they turned out all right you know they really don't poke out that much but for the most part I think they have a pretty decent finish for pallet wood so the next part of the equation is to figure out my latch mechanism and I already did that so if you look up here at the natural holes of the the pallet wood where they had it nailed I took advantage of one of those and I added kind of a fake nail and what basically what my plan is is to use a magnet embedded in a picture frame and then when I wave it dragging along there that magnet is going to pull out a nail and allow the trap door to drop so now that that's all finished I'm going to add some leather straps or something like that that kind of looks vintage or period to hold a whiskey bottle and some glasses so the next piece you see will be it in action alright guys well it's finally installed and my wife was I kind enough to put some pictures on it for me and get me pictures to modify for the latch so come in here I'll show you the backside of this I found a little bit stronger magnet and I will paint it black but I wanted you to be able to see it pretty easy so basically all I have to do to release the hatch is take a little pressure off the bottom door put it right there you'll see the nail gets attached to it and voila there's my stash so let me show you a couple different angles of this and you know a little more detail of this and hopefully it's something you guys liked so thanks for watching as always and we'll see you next time Oh you ",

        "content": "yeah oh hey guys welcome back to another episode of doing with Jason I'm Jason and today I will be showing you how to construct magical floating shelves but it's gonna be awesome so stick around and watch oh hang up there here is our diagram of a floating shop so it consists of six parts we've got the top the bottom the front the left and the right depending on which way you're looking at it and which way it's going so basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna make one that's 24 inches wide by 8 inches deep by two and a half inches tall and that's gonna leave us a we're using 3/4 ply here here so that's gonna leave us with a 1 inch cleat to be at a mountain you would mount this to the wall and then this part of the shelf would just basically slip right over it and maybe just fasten it with a couple of nails or maybe a screw or two and you'll be all set here is a lovely list of items that you might find handy for this job screw gum what glue broom broom a stander an appropriately sized clamp a fancy nail gun what Feller things your paint step right up for a magical cut list we have two pieces of eight inch by two and a half by 3/4 solid wood that'll be your left in your rice then we have one piece 24 inches by two and a half by three-quarter solid that way your front piece that we might are together then you will have your two pieces of 22 and a half by seven and a quarter by 3/4 plywood which will be your top in the bottom why is it seven in a quarter not eight inches well you got to deduct the three quarter inch front that is solid and then you end up with seven and a quarter that was math now finally you need a 1-inch piece of twenty two and 3/8 by 3/4 plywood for your cleat why is it twenty two and 3/8 not twenty-two and a half well that's a good question the reason is you want to leave a little play there you don't want to be stuck is about going to be loose as a goose so let's get this thing kicked in a buck halt [Music] all right guys so I'm cutting my side pieces so what I want to do is set it against the fence of the miter saw and I'm gonna cut my 45 let's have it set on 45 and here we go so we've got the top the bottom the left the right and the back little cleat hidden in here and this is the top piece I'm holding up it's not floating it's my hand alright so we're gonna do a little dry fit here just to make sure everything is nice and good and works out so you know you're gonna have this what's gonna happen is you're gonna have a cavity here and that is where your cleats gonna go and slip on for you know basically hanging it but you don't put that in yet we're just making sure it all fits we got a front piece and then we have our side pieces and everything looks like it's gonna work alright we are ready to glue this bad boy up and hang it my little ones room she's gonna be really excited to be getting this one now what you're gonna do is take some glue and it doesn't matter if you start top bottom you know just do the top or bottom so basically run a strip of glue in here and what I used to do is get nice and dirty and you just kind of want to wipe it all over the place you want a nice even glue spread because if you don't then you know it just looks like you know what you're doing more so when he do this when someone's up they're like whoa don't do that that's cool so just do this so now I'm gonna want to set up my 45s make sure they're nice and centered or even if they are a little big or a little small you don't wanna be a little small little bigs okay sometimes these are right on so really you're just gonna want to you know get that really close you're gonna flush this out the solid wood with the plywood we want you know just nice and even so you're not somebody and my gun is not loaded so and then we're just gonna put a nail so typically I'll do that I'm just spaced out maybe every five inches or so just the less holes the less bill you will need and the better it will look all right now we're ready to do either you know you can look at it this way might be easier so now we're ready to do our side pieces if you don't want to glue both sides at once and the 45 piece on the solid would just wipe it all in hopefully for your sake were fast-forwarding right now if not well you know so we're doing that and now you do the lay it down we'll leave it standing for just you guys can see and then you're gonna bring the 45 in to that and get it nice and get this nice and squish it up here and we'll be right back after a word from our sponsors do we have sponsors okay so what I'm doing here is just clamping it up to make sure you know just to hide all the gaps close some suckers up not really hide anything just closing things up that way we use less nails oh wow that's heavy ah be sure to use clamps that are way too big for the job like I always do they do make shorter ones why would you need that Rowland oh righty whether you're painting this sucker when it's done are you staining it you're gonna want to fill them holes those holes will show up faster than a freaking 40 cent hooker when you have a dollar bill I just made it almost pink you cook with it so you're gonna just grab some normal wood filler and you're gonna want to just you know putty those suckers up just continue that around all the sides and then we will be ready to sand it doesn't make any sense all right guys this amazing floating shelf is ready to be sanded all the glue is dry the bunny's dry and we are ready to go you're gonna grab your orbital sander put some 80 grit on it and go to town alright guys this amazing grape floating shelf is all at 80 now we're gonna go to 120 all right got it so 120 is all done uh we're gonna move on 180 just make sure you have your dust masks it starts getting a little dusty after sanding for so long just have that nearby and you're ready to go alright guys so what we have here in front of us is a wall we're gonna hang our shelf we're ready I got the cleat i pre-drilled tools you can either pre-drill with a drill and a drill bit or I just use the screws went through them just to clean them out ready to go so are you gonna put it on your whole wall are you gonna want to level it so you can get a level which I don't have one here well here we will pretend and then you know you're gonna use the level it's going to tell me if I'm off or not now I'm gonna want to move it around so then you know once you're you find level you are going to pinky throw this to me chubby all right so you take your shelf you pre drill two holes if you want to use screws the backsides Hollow it will slip right over this thing put your screw gun there with some screws and you are secure there's the other one and get the second one now these don't take a lot of weight you don't want to just go you know hang on these things this isn't a monkey bar it is a bookshelf most likely or a spray can holder or a pitcher holder or anything you can think of that's not that heavy this off all right guys we're ready to paint this thing I like to paint it in place because you get to all five sides there's the math again at once so it's a lot better and easier and quicker you have to flip it and all that stuff or you can stand it up yeah I guess that would work too yeah you some spray paint will you understand off the shelf a little get it debris off of it maybe blow it off we don't have one back here and then yeah just start spraying it breo's zero zero five one and there are you there you have it just there yeah it was very simple something you can do in a matter of you know a couple of minutes hours however you want to take your time if you liked this video please you know like the little button down there check it touch it something and you know subscribe but for now here is what not to do [Music] ",

easy and now for the sliding bookends and to make those I'm just going to cut two blocks and this old hardwood four before a fence post it should look good now to enable these bookends to slide backwards and forwards we need to kind of slot into the top of that shelf to accommodate one of these bolts and I'm cutting that slot with a jigsaw but it could use a wrapper or even a circular saw shh shh and here's the slot all cut out I think it turned out pretty well and the bolt just simply goes in there like that and slides up and down I like it it's now time to attach these bookends now this side here is going to be fixed so I'm going to insert a few screws from underneath to hold that in place but this side here is going to be able to slide backwards and forwards so we need to drill a hole in the top of that to accommodate this bolt and there you have it bolt goes in nicely now let's give it a couple of firm taps to make sure that it sits nice and flat I like it and to attach the stationary bookend I've got it sitting in the right spot now I'll put a couple nails in it underneath then turn it over and cert a couple of screws now lift the book in that slides you'll need to lock it in place with a nut now that might get a bit tricky and a bit awkward so what I thought I'd do is make a bigger nut out of this old piece of four before I've drawn a design on the face there I'll cut that out and then drop in this nut like that and hopefully that works let's give it a crack so here's the big wooden nut and I've drilled a hole into the center not all the way through but almost all the way through and then I'm traced around this nut onto that surface just there I'll chisel that out and have this set in to that nut just flush with the surface and so here's the metal nut inside the wooden nut and he sits nice and flush with the surface and I held the nut in place with a dab of glue and now all you need to do is to screw this onto that bulb just like that too easy and the big nut makes a job of screwing it on and screwing it off an absolute breeze I like it all right up to the last stage and that's to put two coats of clear satin varnish over the whole lot and here it is all varnished up and I reckon it turned out absolutely fantastic you also notice how if paint at the top of those bolts yellow just for a bit of added contrast and this the adjusting nut underneath all right it's now time to duck inside and screw that shelf support to the wall all right the shelf support is now attached to the wall it's really important to get at least one screw into two different studs otherwise it may come down now if you're having trouble finding a stud I made a video on a really tricky method of how to find one make sure you check it out I'll leave a link in the description box down below alright this is nice and level so it's now time to attach the shelf and to do that what you have to do is place the shelf on top of the shelf support and screw into it too easy great tip knackers that so there it is my easy to build pallet wood floating shelf weird adjustable bookends how cool is that well I hope you enjoyed and found that video useful and if this is your first time to my channel welcome and please hit that subscribe button and don't forget to give the video the old thumbs up that's always greatly appreciated and while you here check out my facebook page at DIY for knuckleheads the links in the description box below now thank you ages yet maybe a few photos going back to the four words of the finished product alright I think it's time for a cup of tea settle next time I'm out of here Cheers ",

        "content": "hey guys it's Angela today's tutorial is going to be a home decor episode I decided to finally go ahead and tackle my dining room wall I was kind of throwing around ideas between hanging art and doing tutorial on how to do a picture wall and I was going to go mirror but there's so many mirrors in my house I cannot possibly add another mirror so what I decided to do is go ahead and do a custom coffee bar if you do not drink coffee obviously you can use this as a dessert bar as an hors d'oeuvre bar if you host people it could be a tea bar it could be an alcoholic bar anyways I just want to go ahead and show you how to do it how to customize it it's really really easy so don't be intimidated let's go ahead and start it and I'll see you at the end of the video so here is my dining room wall as you can see we have a vaulted ceiling so I wanted to do something a little more special what you'll need to create your coffee bar is two floating shelves and then we will also be creating a chalkboard wall to go behind it I'm using this piece of masonite just because I want a really smooth surface and I don't want to have to paint back over the wall when I leave if you decide to use the base tonight start by drilling two holes and the top corners now using a leveler and my console to balance the masonite I'm marking two spots on to the wall where I drilled the holes now I'm going to drill the holes into the wall and add the inker obviously I don't suggest balancing on things I've just been doing this for a really long time and my balance is really good so I'm comfortable standing on furniture now I'm going to go ahead and put that back and then I'm going to drill the holes through the board and into the anchor now remember if you don't mind painting over the wall when you move out you don't need to do this part now I'm going to be moving on to the floating shelves you can follow the instructions I'm taking the measurement as to where the bar will go that is going to hold my floating shelves you always want to use your leveler when doing these parts of the project as you can see I drilled my holes through the masonite now we are ready to start painting I'm going to go ahead and wipe it down and you want to go ahead and tape it off now like I said if you weren't going to use the masonite this is exactly what you would do you would just tape off a large square above a piece of furniture or whatever you would like and then you can go ahead and start painting I'm using a primer and then chalkboard paint and a sand block the primer I had tinted a light grey just to make sure that the chalkboard was nice and black the way I wanted to look now that the primer is done I'm going to give it a little sand obviously it has dried for a few hours and now I'm going to start my first coat of paint this is where you would begin if you didn't use the masonite board you would paint your wall and hang your shelves our first coat is done so now we can move on now that we have all of our anchors in place we have our masonite on the wall and we applied the paint it needs two hours to dry so I'm going to go ahead and run to Ikea and get some things for the coffee bar I was going to go to the goodwill but IKEA actually has really cute coffee sets that are like a dollar fifty so I'm going to go there like thirty dollar budget and go ahead and see what I can get and then when I come back I will finish the last coat of paint and we'll go ahead and put everything together quick painters tip to preserve your brush wrap it in a plastic bag and throw some tape around the handle and then put it in your refrigerator you can leave it in there up to a week even and when you unwrap it it'll still be nice and fresh now this is what I got at IKEA like I said I got some coffee sets this creates foam and espresso cup a few glasses for when I like to add alcohol to my coffee drinks a jar for tea bags and then a croissant or a cake tray now that the second coat is dried I can remove the painters tape and we can add the shelves and then we can start decorating I'm screwing the brace into the wall and then you simply slide the floating shelf onto the two rods floating shelves come with two stabilizer screws so you want to attach those and now I'm attaching the final shelf and we can decorate now let's have some fun and start decorating if you decide to switch around the design a little bit and don't want the coffee pot you could always switch it out for some candlesticks or anything you desire now that I have everything up and in place I have all the glasses in place everything's done no coffee bar is complete without custom chalk art so these are your options obviously I went to my goals and they didn't have a few things there and Martha Stewart does have a like a chalk ink thing that makes it really easy to apply chalk it doesn't smear but this does alarm big enough and they weren't what I wanted them to be so I put an ad on Craigslist for $25 for a tattoo artist to come over and do some custom chopper and this is the final I hope you guys enjoyed today's tutorial on how to customize and design your own coffee bar ",

        "content": "today I'm going to make a set of DIY clothing shelves for less than seven dollars a piece and before we get started here's your list of materials to make this show it does not require a ton of tools I'm using one 8 foot piece of lumber for each shelf I'm going to start by cutting away the large pieces first and you can use a handsaw or you can use power tools depending on if you have them or not if you're using a circular saw you can use a speed square as a guide while you make your cut and of course if you have a miter saw this should make quick work of all these cuts and after all the pieces are cut I'll end up with 4 pieces of lumber measuring 32 inches and 4 pieces of lumber measuring at 6 inches if you're a bit more experienced then consider using miter cuts for the corner now apply wood glue to the joint to hold this entire ship together I'm going to use a half inch dowel I'm going to mark the dowel so that it goes through both pieces of wood and have to add in the first value you want to add a second one on the opposite side so you'll end up with two dollars per corner apply wood glue to the dowel and also place glue down in the holes hammer the dowel down into the hole until they hit a stopping point then take a saw and cut off the excess [Music] you can apply wood filler to fill in all the imperfections or you can leave it as it is which is the way I'm leaving it I'm just going to stand it down with 80 grit sandpaper and then come back with 120 and then 220 to finalize it the choice is all up to you you can paint it or stain it for me I'm going to use an oil rubs brown paint to paint the shells and I really like the way this paint looks because when the light hit it it has this nice rich look to it the paint itself it's pretty thick and after the second coat you see hardly any brush streak after the first coat of paint it had to actually look to it but after applying a second coat of paint the color really started to come up and here's a quick tip for you if you ever want to mount something on a wall and you just wanted to transfer it to the wall easily then this should work just fine for you here I'm going to take a piece of scrap wood I'm going to mark two holes exactly where I want the mounted holes to be then I transfer those holes over to the wood then I take the same piece of wood and I love with that too the walls mark those holes and it should line up every time now trace out the keyhole hanger onto the wood before you drill and here I'm going to take a bit to drill out the opening if you want to keep it simple and easy just surface-mount the keyhole hanger to the back of the shelf however if you want it to look much nicer and flat to the wall you'd want to consider mortising the keyhole hanger into the wood and I'll show you how you can do that with a drill bit and a razor blade [Music] and now when it comes to mounting the chef I'm going to find the center of the wood that I previously used to mark the mounting holes and once I find the center I'm going to use that wood and find the center within the opening that I wish to mount the shelf while holding the wood level mark the mounting holes to mount the shelves I'm going to use these plastic screw drywall anchors and each one of these hold up to 50 pounds [Music] if you're new to woodworking and you'd want to get started consider checking out my limited tools video playlist down in the description I will be back to post on limited tools projects starting next week I'm Glen with DIY creators and don't forget to like comment and subscribe I'll catch you on the next one ",

        "content": "Jason: I'm going to show you how to build\na shelf. Now, it doesn't matter where you are or what\nroom you're in, everyone needs a shelf, for an iron in the laundry, or your tea and coffee\nin your kitchen. I'm going to show you how to put it all together. The tools I'm going to use are the drill and\nimpact driver. I've got my tape measure, brackets, spirit\nlevel, pencil, drill, and some fixings, a stud finder, some white paint, and the safety\ngear, as well. I'm going to use the stud finder to locate\nthe studs so I know where to put my screws. These two marks that I have on the wall, the\ncenter of the stud should be located right in the middle of those, so I'm just gonna\nmeasure center and that will give me the center of our stud. That should be my stud. I'm going to position my shelf bracket over\nthe stud that I've marked on the wall. I'm gonna mark those three circles for the\nscrews. Before I screw anything off, I'm going to\ndrop my spirit level down the outside of it to make sure it's nice and plumb. Now that I have the marks, I'm gonna pre-drill\nthose holes and put my timber screws in there, fix the bracket to the wall. I'm screwing in the timber so I have pilot\nholes into the stud. My bracket will sit in position. I will drive my timber screw in three positions. I've painted the top of the blank so it matches\nthe bracket itself. The reason I put that top screw in before\nthe middle one, the middle one is right close to that middle bracket, and if I put it in\nthere before I put the top one in, it'll push the bracket over. So bottom one first to secure it, top one\nto keep it in position, middle one last. Now that my first bracket is up, I'm now gonna\nmark the position for my second bracket. My shelf is 700 mill long. I'm gonna come in 100 mill from each end of\nmy shelf. My second bracket will be 500 mill across,\nand I'm gonna measure that now and put a level line in here. I've marked out my three new holes. Ideally, your bracket's going in your timber\nstuds. In this case, I know there's no timber stud\nhere. I'm going to be using a wall anchor. What it does is it flares open behind the\nplaster, so it'll lock in and hold this stud in position. Now that I've got my hole in the wall, I'm\ngoing to push my anchor in there. To get it to work, I need to tighten that\nup. Once it's tight, I take it out, and then fit\nmy bracket over the top of that. Now that I've got both of my brackets on the\nwall, I'm going to put my shelf up there. All I need to do now is mark and pilot hole\nthe four holes so I can put my screws in. That's how you build a shelf. Singers: Bunnings Warehouse! ",

        "content": "Shelving is a great way to organize and declutter\na space especially a corner. I'm going to show you how easy it is to make\na nice, clean corner shelf at a cost effective price. Let's turn this wasted space into a functional\ncorner and free up that much needed floor space. These are the materials and tools required\nto build a corner shelf. This particular piece has been pre-cut at\nBunnings but you can have yours cut to any length. All that will be required is to cut it on\na 45-degree angle when you get it home. Mark and measure out your 45-degree miter\njoint and then cut it. Now the miter joint is being done, you need\nto measure top, bottom and center so you know where to drill the holes for the dowels. Now drill the holes for the dowels to go into\nthe shelves. A handy little tip is to use half the measuring\nlength of the dowel against your actual drill bit and mark it with a bit of masking tape\nso you don't go too deep. Repeat the same process on the other shelf\nthen use some PVA glue to secure the dowels. Put some glue in the holes on the other shelf\nand run a little bit down the extra miter joint and join them together. Now push the two shelves together ensuring\nthat they're nice and flush with one another. Wait for the glue to dry and then sand off\nany rough edges. Measure and mark the desired height of the\ntwo shelves in the corner of your room making sure that they are nice and level. Find the studs, screw the flanges to the studs. Place shelves up onto the pipes in the corner. Screw the pipes onto the ends of the pipes\nto give it a really nice finish. The corner shelving is now being finished\nand turned into a functional space. We've painted our shelving but you can do\nat any color you like or leave it natural. They are so easy to make. Not only this corner shelving a great storage\nsolution but it's also a fantastic feature for the style of the room. ",

        "content": "hi Rosie hi Rosie hey guys and welcome back with my channel today's video is going to be something a little bit different I'm going to be doing kind of a home decor DIY video so a little while back I actually did a video on how I completely redid our like dining room table it was just a classic wood table and I kind of flipped it and made it farmhouse style I painted it in stained it so I thought I would just kind of continue this little series here on my channel as I you know work on my house and fix it up a little bit I'm basically just trying to do everything on a small budget and do a lot of it myself do a lot of DIY project so today's video I'm going to be showing you how I made these really awesome DIY floating shelves they kind of have a rustic farmhouse feel and they were very inexpensive and actually surprisingly really easy to put together so I'm going to show you step-by-step everything I did to create these beautiful shelves you can kind of see a little bit of a sneak peak of one of the shelves behind me I am still working on decorating them but they are just totally transforming in this room which is our main living room and I'm so in love with them so I'm going to show you guys everything that I did the very first thing that we did is we went to Lowe's our local Lowe's and picked up the materials that I needed so first I just picked out four of like the pre-cut like wood plank fours we used pine and they were super easy to find you just go to like the wood section of the store and they have like all different cuts and lengths and widths of just different wood planks four foot planks were perfect for the wall space you're working with so I picked up four of those and then I also grabbed some Elle hooks I believe they're called and that's what we actually used to like fasten the shelves to the wall and then lastly I picked up some black spray-paint which is what I used on the l-looks to turn them from boring ugly metal into like a matte black some of the supplies that I needed for this project I already had at home like one stain and screws and you know things like that so once we got all that stuff we headed home and neck I started working on actually the shells themselves turning them from boy blanks to really gorgeous stained shelves so the very first thing I did was just give each of the wood planks a good sanding and then brush all of the sanding dust off so then it was time to stain the wood if you can see the Roses tale just ignore it considering were you guys doing on the couch right now but I used a stain from mini wax it's actually the same stain I used on my dining room table the top of it and I believe it's in the shade espresso and basically I just painted that on with a paint brush going with the grain I just did one coat because the what I like the way that that color payoff turned out it's kind of a rich deep cool tone brown I really like it so I went ahead and I stayed all four of the shells or the wood planks and then I let that sit overnight and just completely dry and the next day I went back and I actually put like a top coat or a finish on it like a wood finish which is just clear these aren't really going to be touched or handled ever so I probably could have just skip this but I figured I would just put one coat on the directions actually said to put like two to three coats on and let them dry and then sand in between but since no one's ever going to be touching these I just throw in one coat and called it a day not sure if that that we were supposed to do it seems to be okay thus far I am so not Pro when it comes to sup I'm just like totally winging it so who knows the next thing I did was I spray-painted all of the L hooks so they would be like a nice matte black I just took them off my backyard throw down a plastic-like drop cloth and just sprayed them on all sides that was super easy and then the next thing to do was actually install them on the wall so for this part I actually had Matt come and help me because he's a little bit better with this kind of stuff I did help out but he definitely just the rains as far as the installation of my DIY shelves so the first step to actually hang them on the wall was choosing where we were going to put them so we just kind of measured on the wall and figured out where they would fit best you know on the wall space that we had and then we just went ahead and marked those areas for where we kind of wanted the shelves to sit then we went ahead and used a handy stud finder to go ahead and just find like the drywall like the not the drywall but the wood planks and I don't even know what the term for those are but you guys find out what I'm talking about so we use the stud finder to locate these studs and then we would actually hammer the L hooks into those studs so I just put it into the drywall as well and just need to make sure to get those like special hooks like the plastic with the nail inside it's like a two-for-one type screw and those hold a lot of weight and you can just put it directly in the drywall and you don't need a stud but our stud we're conveniently located to where we kind of wanted to put the L books on the wall so it worked out fine so once we figure out where the studs were and do where we were going to be hammering in we went ahead and just made like a small line on the wall where like the bottom of each shelf would go and that way we knew exactly where the L hooks should kind of like land on the wall because the L hook was gonna be holding the bottom of the shelf so once we had that done he actually went ahead and started putting the L hook on the wall and as he was going along he kept using the level over and over just to make sure that everything was obviously level but more so that so that each hook was completely level with each other so we wouldn't have like crooked shelves because that would not be good then once we had our L hooks on the wall we went ahead and just plopped each of these shelves on top and then perfectly measure to make sure that it was even on both sides so it was like perfectly centered on the wall and then I went in with a pencil this is actually something I did I went in with a pencil and marked where we should be screwing these screws into the into the boards like through the L books so on the L hooks there was like a screw that would go into the wall and then there was also a couple of like screw holes to go up into obviously the shelf so that the whole thing is stable so I just went in with a pencil and just kind of marked off where those screw holes were so we knew exactly where to drill which is what we did next so we just took our shelves and drill a hole for each of the screws to go in it was super straightforward and simple and very very easy and then the very last thing to do was just put the shelves back on the wall and screw the wood screws up into the boards through the L hook so that they were secured from the underneath as well so that was it it was actually a very simple process and it was definitely like out of my comfort zone our comfort zone because we're not usually using drills and like getting all fancy like if anything will like hang a picture frame but honestly it was very and both of us were like surprised at how well they turned out that was like these are actually really great this is a good idea it's like thank you they honestly add so much to the room I am so excited to go in and decorate them I do have some stuff on here now but they're all pretty much like MVP Supremes that still need pictures so I am still working on that and I'm slowly working on getting this whole living room together in general and I'm definitely like a few months down the road I would love to do a living room tour of this whole room once it is like completed so if you guys want to see a video like that please let me know because I would love to film that I think it would be so fun but that is all I have for this video I hope that you guys enjoyed watching it if you do try out these DIY shelves definitely let me know I would love to see what you guys create and what you come up with and kind of what your visions are I love doing projects around the house it's like seriously like so much filling for me I don't know I just really really really enjoy it especially when I can do it on a budget that makes me even happier so thank you guys so much for watching this video make sure to subscribe if you haven't already I will definitely have more DIY like home decorating videos coming out have a lot of things in mind including a major kitchen renovation that I am also doing on a major budget so definitely stay tuned for that and if you have yet to

        "content": "today I will show you how to build this modern TV stand the lower portion of the stand will include square storage compartments for my electronic equipment the television will be in the central part and modern-style shelves will be added above it the necessary cable conduits and all the cabling have been installed beforehand first begin by tracing the outline of the TV stand onto the wall cut your metallic studs to the desired length here I'm using a tool called a nibbler it is easy to use and cuts with great precision now drill holes into the studs for the fixing screws the tips of the screws will allow you to mark the wall and help you know where you will need to drill drill into the wall for plasterboard walls I advise inserting a hollow wall anchor first now screw the metallic studs into the wall place a small candle block inside the stud it will come in handy later fix all the metallic studs to the wall the metallic structure is assembled much like a Meccano kit using key new blocks and metallic studs the structure is then connected to the studs on the wall with the small cube blocks we inserted earlier before fixing the MDF petals drill countersink holes to hide the screw heads I can easily adjust the structure by sliding the metallic studs into the cube blocks with key note I am certain that my construction is straight and properly positioned along the plasterboard clamp everything together before screwing the panel and please continue building the metallic structure with the key new blocks complete the structure with 6 millimeter MDF panels and insert polyester to reduce noise fix a metallic stud onto the wall and insert a small key nook block inside the horizontal stud notice that the structure is not fixed into the floor there is no need to damage your tiling as with this type of construction the TV stand will be sufficiently stable once finished continue building the structure one by one screw the MDF panels into place crimping small pieces of stud onto the horizontal track will create a support for the lower panels it is absolutely key that your MD of panels be carefully cut to the required dimensions this will ensure that everything fits well together now onto the lower central box with the help of two cube blocks I can easily fix a metallic stud onto the vertical panel continue building the structure and complete it with panels for the long horizontal shelf I'll be using an aluminum foot which will serve as a solid support the lower MDF panel is six millimeter thick plaster board moving on to the side of the stand start off by screwing a small piece of stud onto the existing horizontal panels this side panel will provide a solid base to work with for the upper long horizontal shelf once assembled the structure is extremely solid here's proof for you I can now start to work on the upper horizontal shelf in the same way as before build the last shelf by starting with a vertical part to guarantee a solid base for the horizontal shelves cutting your panels precisely will reduce the amount of finishing touches required voila all that is left to do is to band the edges apply acrylic sealant before screwing the edge panels in once Cruden remove the excess sealant for the edges I'm using six centimeter wide MDF slats cover up the screw holes with wood filler fill in the gaps between the slats with acrylic sealant sand\u00e9 apply finishing compound sand lightly and here we are the TV sand is finished all that is left to do is to apply a couple of coats effect you log on to WKYT s and tips ",

        "content": "what's happening guys is Glenn with DIY creators and today I'm going to be making a floating bookshelf a lot of angles a lot of cuts and a whole lot of patience so yeah let's do it this video is sponsored by video blogs before I started this project I wanted three things modern unique and bold this shelf was for a small area which I wanted it to be no longer than 48 inches it had to be functional beautiful and after making a rough sketch I was happy with what I saw this project calls for a lot of angles which could make it a bit difficult for a project to tackle with no real planning I guessed on the angle of 20 degrees and I started from there I made my first cut at 30 inches for the trim using 1 by 3 pine I lined up the to trim and made a mark then I set the miter gauge to 50 degrees for the second cut after every cut I set up the trim just to give me a visual that I was on the right path and the next Bend I need to make in the term has to be parallel to the first cut I used the aluminum tubing to carry out the line took a piece of wood place it on the line and marked above it and now I'm going to cut on the line which is the next bend in the trim and for the next cut I just measured from the bottom of the trim carry that out 18 inches wherever that land then that's where I cut then I cut off that piece of trim down on the miter saw and while I was at it I cut the two ends off for the shelf since the depth of the Shelf is 10 inches I make the trim nine point five inches and that's it behind the front trim I also cut the plywood down to nine and a half inches as well now making a frame can be tricky because it requires a lot of angles without a hanger finder I'd have a hard time making this happen the angle of this piece is 110 degrees and I need two pieces of plywood to meet up in the corner and for me to find the angle of that I divided the 110 in half which put me at 55 degrees I subtracted that from 90 which gave me the value of 35 degrees then I made my first cut the corner of a square is 90 degrees and that's where I got the 90 from now mark this piece of wood just past the bottom of the trim that's adjacent to it and I used the same method to find all the other angles so here's where it really starting to get tricky if you notice that this corner is very pointed and that's a 50 degree angle at the very top now my table saw does not go to 50 it stops at 45 and the only way for me to make this cut was making a jig I'm not sure what something like this is even called or if it even exists I do plan to study it and make some improvement to it and I'll share with you guys in a later video being that it is on hinges makes it extremely flexible to pretty much set whatever angle you need to cut on the table saw and I'm taking a piece of wood here and I'm attaching it to the bottom of it because this is how I'm going to support the swing of it and then I'll just install the screw in the side and lock it in place I also added another piece of wood on the opposite side so that I can clamp it onto the sled now using the angle finder I can set the angle that I need and now screw the jig in place so that it's fixed then using a test piece to make sure that the angle is correct the angle looks pretty good other than the freight edges I could take a sanding block and easy just clean that up and it should be good to go I did went on to make the final cut on the work piece now I was not perfect you know I wish I got a better cut out of it but the cut that I did get it was workable and I was able to work around it and make it work just fine and to get another visual of it before going to the nailing in the gluing process I wanted to make sure that it all fits together just fine and while I'm working on that in the background I'm going to take a few seconds to tell you guys about videoblocks who has the largest unlimited download library of stock video motion background and After Effects just like the one

forever and to check them out just click the link in the video description or go to videoblocks comm /youtube and as shown in the video I'm using the wood glue and I'm using nail gun and for the nail gun I started in the corners and work my way out to the ends using one by three trim and 3/4 inch plywood that gave me a slim space for my wall bracket so I had to beef up the wall bracket the best I could so that I can believe in the strength of it I cut the bracket to a 1 inch thickness on the table saw set a stop block to 8 inches to make repetitive cuts for the arms on the bracket I want the location of the studs on the bracket then place two arms outside the stud and two arms inside the stud trace the arms about a half inch in on the back of the bracket now for this dado cut I'm going to use my table saw but you can use a few different method a circle saw a table saw a router a hand chisel or even a hand saw there's many ways to get this done when using a table saw it's best to get the out edge first and then work your way to the inside now apply glue and insert the arms and this should be pretty snug if it's not then insert some shim to make it tight and remember the plywood I'm using is 3/4 inch thick and that alone is pretty heavy so I added some l-bracket on the side to make the arms even that much stronger I only added he'll bracket on one side of the arm but if you're cautious then you can also add them on both sides and I use the same method for the remainder of the bracket and to finish up the bracket I added 1/3 inch screws from the back now one thing to point out I did find the studs in the wall before I made the bracket and to mount the bracket I'm going to use quarter inch screws three inches long now as you can see I marked all over the wall because the wall need painting I did not have to do all that it just made my life a little easier so I can get back and see the visual of what a shelf is going to be in your case you could have used tape or you can have somebody hold the shelf in place until you find the right spot for it and I also made a small bracket to support the weight of the suspended end of the shelf now this should help support the weight and one thing to notice that I can only fit this in one of the studs so the other hole have to go right into the drywall and of course you don't want to run a screw right into the drywall so in my case I'm going to use some Hilty toggles and they're pretty slick and they're extremely strong and now for my least favorite part of woodworking and that's sanding and I'm going to try something a little different because I am experimenting trying to find ways to get better finish and what I wanted to do this time was sand first and then come back in with the wood filler and then just did a light sand again to remove the excess now overall I did see a bit of an improvement but I think I can do better in my future projects now the story behind this bookshelf is this should be an accident piece for the desk that I do plan to build and I went a little Bowl with the color so it's just paint and if it doesn't look the way I expected once both pieces done then I can always repaint it this is a paint and primer I don't recall the color of it the exact color but it is a lime green and it's made by Valspar and it's a satin finish so I really like this project and I loved the way it came out you know I'm really excited I can't wait to start building a desk that actually goes with this bookshelf and you know I never actually made a project of this magnitude that had so many angles on it and so many cut it was pretty sophisticated and I managed to pull it off at one point I was wondering what did I even get myself into but actually you know you take your time I did get through it and I'm really excited the way this one came out so you guys let me know what you think about this project down in the comment to let me know if this is something you want to see more style like this so I'll be waiting on that and also don't forget to hit the like button the share button and you can also catch me on social media I'm on facebook I'm on Instagram you can catch up with my projects and see what I'm doing behind the scenes so my links are down in the video description and I also have them on the screen as well so you guys don't forget to catch me on those and that's it for this one guys I'll catch you guys on the next one peace ",

        "content": "every one I always felt that one of the walls in my room was pretty bare and so finally I decided that I wanted to build some shelves for my cat meat gremlin I previously built a cat food for him so I figured a few shelves would be nothing and the reason I wanted to make shelves for him partly was to put his food up there because my dog loves cat food and currently I keep his food on my dresser which my dog is now big enough to reach up there and get to it so I needed a place that was higher up to put that cat and I also just wanted to give him some high places that he could hang out on so today I'm going to show you guys how to make some of your own let's get started you'll need a heavy duty stapler that can also use Brad's or finishing nails a drill a jigsaw wood glue stain or whatever you want to use to finish your wood carpet food and water bowls with a lip around the edges brackets two hanging shelves one piece of wood an inch by one inch by 8-foot cut into three pieces that are 32 inches long four pieces of wood two inch by 1/4 inch by four-foot take three of the pieces and cut into two pieces that are 32 inches and 10 inches long what's the fourth piece cut three pieces that are 10 inches long I wanted a nice clean look so I used miter joints I made a total of three shelves but I only made two types one being a friggin water shelf with recessed bowls and the other being a simple carpeted shelf first things first you need to cut all the wood to size I don't have a work bench so I just do this kind of stuff on my floor I got the big piece of wood cut at the store but for the smaller pieces I whipped out my miter box and pull saw and got to measuring and cutting when you're cutting wood for a miter joint you want the proper measurement to be the smaller face of the wood like so only one end of the ten inch pieces need to be cut at an angle the other just need to be cut flat because they're going to be resting against the wall for the food and water shelf take your bowls and figure out the placement you want I decided to put one on each end since we're making recessed bowls we'll need to drill a hole into the wood that's big enough to fit the body of the bowl but small enough so the lip can't go through I flipped the bowl over and traced around the bull's lip and from there since the lip of the bowls I used was about 1/4 inch high I balled a smaller circle that was shrunk about 1/4 inch all the way around first drill a pilot hole on the inside of the small circle then simply stick the jigsaw in and trace the circle I left the larger circle intact as a guide of where - absolutely not let the jigsaw pass just in case time to test fit the bowl perfect repeat on the other side now we get to assemble these things and yes back on my floor again I really need a workbench apply glue and use the heavy duty stapler to tack the wood in place with Brad's or finishing nails I don't have clamps but since these won't be stress points you could get away with just using the Brad's to hold the wood in place while the glue dries repeat for each side and each shelf you may have noticed I had a gap where the wood didn't quite meet perfectly it's unfortunate but thankfully it's fixable you just have to squirt some glue into the gap sprinkle some sawdust into it squish it in and then sand the excess glue away so if we have this problem hopefully you haven't cleaned that workspace just yet it's not the prettiest but hey it's better than having a gap right there and for me I stand them a dark color so you can't even tell anymore and here's what the assembled food and water stuff looks like with the bowls in place it's coming together now just assemble the shelves that will have carpet in the same way but we're going to add the carpet after we finish the wood so let the glue dry overnight and then it's time to finish finish the shelves however you like I chose a dark stain apply the finish and let dry or cure as long as the directions say once they're dry it's time to attach the carpet first cut the carpet to the exact size of the big board which was 32 by 10 inches this is the same carpet that I used to make the cat tree that I had mentioned earlier I just went to my local hardware store and got a roll a remnant carpet for pretty cheap I still have so much of that stuff that I'm trying to figure out what to do with I put some glue on the wood and laid the carpet down I don't even know if the glue did anything because ultimately I stapled the carpet in place anyway but it made me feel better so I did it after I laid the carpet over the glue I stapled it in place I made sure to staple the crap out of this thing so the carpet would stay put if Grimm decided to use it as a flat scratching post and here are the finished shelves now we just got to hang them up I wish we had splurged a little to get nicer brackets to hang these up but that's too late now oh well I could probably update them later in stereotypical cat fashion he was totally unimpressed and didn't want to have anything to do with them but a little catnip and some cat toy action later and he finally got up on them and besides coming down to cuddle with me while I sleep he's been up there ever since I hope you'll enjoy I'm glad that they came out the way that I was picturing them in my head and it seems like grandma loves them too which is the whole reason I made them so that's good if you liked this video and want to see more then please subscribe and if you have any questions or suggestions for new videos then please leave a comment down below as always you can follow me on twitter tumblr or Instagram see you next week ",

        "content": "AHH...I need some shelving. I had to stop and think about what it was\nthat I wanted for a while. So I put together a list of pros and cons and settled on a low profile open faced off the\nfloor shelf system. I'm going to need some boards with angles cut in them and I've already gone over how I do that in\nanother video. So head over their if you wanna know a simple and easy way to cut boards to an exact length with\nangled ends. The bracket design I'm using is a simple L\nshape with a cross piece. This is the top piece that the shelf material\nwill sit on. This is the back and that is done for a reason. So that gravity can be my friend and not my enemy. I decided to use this style in order to keep the front of the shelves completely open from one end to the other. Since I'm close to the end of this board I\nwill predrill these holes. For a materials and a cut list. Head over to my website Simply Easy DIY dot com.  Check the description.  I'll have all the links. A \ncouple of spacers keeps my cross peice centered\non the other two boards. After 9 of those it's time for some clean\nup. I have a very specific heigth I am placing\nthis first shelf. I have a future project in mind that is going to force me to put it slightly higher than I initially wanted. I don't have a laser level so I'll do this\nthe hard way. I suppose I could have chalked a line but oh well, this works. The studs in my garage are 24 inches on center so every other one gets a shelf bracket attached to it. That looks good. Lets keep going. Now that all the brakets are up, it's time\nto cut some shelves. Lay down a few pieces on a flat or flat ish surface. Plop some half inch OSB down on them. And get to cuttin. To stiffin up these planks I'm going to glue\nand tack a strip of 2 by 2 to the underside of each one. I have a program on my computer that allows\nme to input all the materials I am working with and it spits back at me the shelf span I can have before I run the\nrisk of sagging shelves. So there were a couple constents I was working\nwith. I wanted each shelf to hold about 300 pounds and I wanted a 48 inch span between the supports. So in order to\naccamplish that I needed a strip of 2 by 2 And another piece attached to the front. If\nyou want the exact sizes of these pieces I'll have everything listed on my website.

        "content": "Hey everybody today I'm going to be building\nmore shelves on this side of this wall. I've already told you about what's happening\non the other side with the plasterboard This side is going to be much more heavy duty. I need something on this side where I can\nthrow bikes or the wheelbarrow against it. So what I've got is heavy duty industrial ply. Flooring grade 7 ply. Normally it would laid on a floor. You can see the tongue an groove to join all\nthe sheets together. Today I'm doing something a bit different,\nI'm going to be using it to line this wall. It will become part of the shelving. The shelves themselves will be suspended from\nthe ceiling not held off the floor. They will be floating (at the back). There will be two shelves, the bottom part\nwill be completely vacant so I can run bikes against it. There will timber from the top to support\nthe shelf. The first at 1200mm off the floor and another at the mid-point. Let's go through the process of how to put\nthis all together. Once again I'm using bugle batten screws as\npart of the fixing process, in this case I've already pre-drilled the holes. Two drills. One to pre-drill, the other to fix the screws. That is not going anywhere. They will be all around the perimeter and\nin the middle of the sheet. I'm using left over material, showing how\nyou can use whatever you might have lying around The shelf will sit directly on the wall lining\nup against the stud wall. You can see how it will be attached to this\nfront support. This is the ceiling support, built into the\nceiling frame and attached with bugle batten screws It has been perfectly aligned with the shelf\npoints. Each end has identical supports. The shelf is already made up. I've already attached the front support in\n90x35. I'll bring that over and sit it on the wall lining and sit it temporarily on the ladder while I screw it together. Now we can take away the ladder and screw\ndown the back. That's the shelf in place. Supported at each end. Next piece is the back wall sheet which will\nalso support the next shelf. Like the bottom lining it will be fixed with screws. There's the backing all in place. Now it's time to attach the shelf, fully supported\nby the wall lining. But first I'll show you how to attach the\nfront support. In this case it's easier to attach this cleat\nfirst and lower the shelf onto it. Now fix the shelf and install the last wall\nlining to stop things falling to the other side The sheets are not long enough to go all the\nway across so I make up these infill pieces. Once again we are going against the mud brick\nwall so I had to scribe out the line of the irregular wall. Then the remainder is attached to the raked ceiling. To work out the rake simply measure the height\nat both ends Measure the length of your level shelf The angle will then be self determined. I'll fit some 2x1 on the front of the shelves\nto protect the edge. You can see how strong the shelves are. They will not go anywhere. No cleat shelves, supported by the wall lining\nand suspended from the ceiling. Thanks for watching! More videos coming soon. ",

        "content": "hey what's up everybody its Glen and today I'm building the eight-foot floating shelf with hidden storage and under mount LEDs the wood I end up using was wood left over from my office desk bill I had just enough left over for me to cut two 12-inch panels from that stash I bought a piece of oak that was about three inches longer than the panel itself and I cut off one of the end had a 45-degree angle ident to the other side mark that and then cut that to a 45-degree angle I cut two trims to cover the edge of the panel only miter in one side a sandwich the two panels together to find out the depth of the spaces I need then I ripped a piece of wood on the table saw I mark and cut spacers down to size with the biscuit joiner I cut the face trim and only one of the side trim add the glue insert the biscuit and join the two with my term router I notched out a track to insert the LED strip over on the router table I use a horse nose bit to taper off the bottom of the trim to use as a pull handle to secure the top panel to the trim a mark location for the pocket holes before screwing the panels together I move my focus over to the drawers which I started by cutting the track side I took that piece over to the table router to knock out a slot and I did that for both sides I then cut out a small strip of wood on the table saw which I used as the tracks for the drawers cut those down to size and then it's on to the front and back of the drawer I then cut out the tracks for the cabinet bottom in all four pieces give it a quick like sand now normally I wouldn't cut a track this close to the edge but I wanted to maintain the space for the remotes that I'm planning to put in this drawer so I glued the box together to make sure that nothing comes apart and now I can come up and let it sit to dry check the square and to make sure everything is good and on to the next piece this piece of wood here will hold one side of the track for the drawer and now I can start assembling the shelf I can also install the spaces now but one issue with these spacers is if you notice they're really close to the edge and that doesn't make a lot of room for my mounting piece so later on in the build I had to cut those down with my router I used some coins as a spacer but you can also use washers or whatever it takes to create a small space and that's what I needed to mount these tracks correctly the LEDs I'm using for this project was leftover from my office desk build which actually worked out great because I got a chance to save some money and reuse the leftover piece I cut out in addition to track and you will see why later on in the build I'm using biscuit joiner for the bottom and even though you're not going to see it I wanted to accomplish a super clean look add a ton of glue insert the biscuit and now I can anchor it down to attach the drawer front I had to trim up against the drawer use my pin nailer to temporarily hold it and screws to finalize seems to sit really well but I had to fine-tune it later to make it sit even better I ripped my cover two by fours on the table saw to make the mounting bracket I used the trim router to cut out some dado slot for the extended arms the extended arm should have been tightly snugged in the slot but for the ones that weren't I use shim to tighten that up and I also glued and screw them from the back side once the brackets done this should look something like this and to get that out of my way I took it to the wall and mounted it in place using a lever to get it straight now I can give all the pieces a quick sand and once I'm done with the sanding I'll take a rag and I wipe off by the excessive dust then I apply the priest and conditioner that is sit for three to five minutes and we can wipe it on and once it's dry I hit it with the sender once again before applying this thing I had two cans of stain that was very similar in color but I couldn't figure out which one I wanted so what I did took a test piece apply the stain and that helped me make my decision on which one I wanted to go with I applied to stand using a brush and then I came back with a rag to remove once the stain dried I wanted to apply a few layers of polyurethane but due to the dry time and the multiple layers that I wanted to put on this I opted to skip that so that I can move along with the video process I then install the LED strip I cut off the wire harness so that I can extend that and use the end for the LED controller I separated all the conductors so that I can strip each one this multi conductor cable I'm using just happen to have all the colors plus more so at this point I can strip each wire and connect color for color I'm using electrical tape to connect each connection and shrink into to protect the bundle applying heat to the tube will reduce the size and protect the connection inside I talked about this slot earlier on the new build and the reason why I cut it is the house the extension of the harness repeat the same thing we did on the opposite end and we should end up with these and with all the tugging and putting I've been doing it's time to test this to make sure everything is good the infrared receiver will sit just below the shelf so that it's visible from underneath the shelf I just so happen to have our outlet right under this location so you would not see a wire unless you look below now to assist me with this thing falling all over the place I use some masking tape to hold it in place again guys thanks for watching and leave a comment down below if you have any question suggestion let me know what you think about this floating shelf let me know if you think it was a winner now also give me a thumbs up if you thought this was a really good project for the channel and if you new to my channel subscribe ",

        "content": "a really awesome project coming up next week so unfortunately this week is going to suck okay today is going to be great today I'm building floating shelf from a 2x4 piece of birch plywood and 1 by 3 a piece of pine this project can be made for under $25 and a little thing I like to call effort if you part of it ok let's do it the first thing we need to do is cut the plywood to 36 inches in length and three and a half inches deep we're going to be using a circular saw and our 1 by 3 as a guide because I suck with the circular saw I'm going to show you the coolest trick how to cut straight are you ready okay check this out this is a circular saw okay this is the circular saws blade and this is the metal guide piece we're going to measure off of the blade to the end of the guide which is an inch and a half we're going to set a 1 by 3 an inch and a half off of our mark and clamp it and use it as a guide check it out once again I'm measuring out 36 inches in length and I'm actually using my 1 by 3 as a straight edge you could use your carpenter square but why slide the plywood around so it's hanging off of the end of your table and we're going to measure one and a half inches off of our mark line your guide marks up with the end of the table and put the 1 by 3 on the marks the 1 by 3 should be flush with the end of the table you can see the blade lines up right where we want it using your muscles you want to apply steady downward pressure and sort of press along the guide if you don't have muscles you can use mental fortitude now that our piece is cut to length we're going to cut the width of three and a half inches in this cut you can see this all lifts up a little bit because I don't have mental fortitude or muscle don't be like me apply downward pressure and you'll be fine I'm using my existing piece as a guide for the next piece we need to thirty six by three and a half inch pieces so we're going to repeat exactly what we just did on my miter saw I'm cutting 2 1 by 3s at three and a half inches they're going to be the outside pieces of our floating shelf then I cut one piece at 36 inches ok now that we have the main box built we're going to put together using D Craig J we set the Kreg jig to accommodate 3/4 inch material and all are doing here is drilling two holes on each of our three and a half inch pieces to attach it to the front 36 inch piece Bronson would blue clamp and screw in with an inch-and-a-quarter pocket screws repeat that on the other side glue up the three inside edges of the pie wood and going to slip it into the front and side of our shelf I'm using my pneumatic brad nailer to attach the plywood to the one my trees if you don't have a brad nailer you can just use glue clamps or heavy objects using an inch and a quarter Brad nails I just make my way down the front of the shelf and we're going to rinse and repeat all of those steps for the other side of the shelf dull nail your fingers I'm using wood filler to fill in all the Brad holes and any imperfections in the shell which turns out to be most of the shell going to let that dry and sand it down so that it's silky smooth I wanted to give the floating shell a distressed look to match the stacked storage chest end table I just made so after sanding the piece I started hitting it with random things such as screwdriver nails hammer let's see some of the marks now when I go to stain it I'm going to make sure the stain penetrates deep into these marks and give it a pretty cool distressed look that's a nice little chocolate that's in the pantry it's not there next to the graham crackers which were next to the marshmallows I did not steal chocolate I swear I did not okay but I left enough for s'mores so okay so I distressed my floating shelves and now I'm going to throw some paint on to sort of further that effect I'm masking it out with painters tape and let it dry and then I'm going to sand off as much as I want to try and get the desired look that I want and I'm going to stay in a similar fashion that I did the stack storage chest end table I want these to match but we'll see how that goes check it out I'm gonna let that dry and maybe I'll have some s'mores okay while the paint dries on our floating shell I'm going to measure the inside and it's just shy of an inch and 5/8 so for our bracket we'll take some 1 by 2's which are actually three quarters of an inch by one and a half and they'll slide in there really nicely like so okay there's a little bigger that's why we want it to be too tight and then we're going to cut a few pieces so that we can reach the end of the inside I'll just show you I cut 4 1 by 2's at 2 and 5/8 of an inch and one long piece at 35 and a half inches this is what we're going to use outer bracket ideally we want to evenly distribute the 1 by 2 support pieces so that it bears the wave of the show using the B and C holes on our Kreg jig we're going to put two pilot holes in each piece at one button then using an inch and a quarter pocket screws we're going to attach the 1 by twos where we discuss just a second while it was less of a discussion and more of me telling everybody that's kind of how a relationship is right very one-sided I might have you can see our bracket slides in and out nicely over floating shelf this is perfect this is exactly what we planned for we are the best I'm going to peel this masking tape off and then sand it down just to give it a weathered look go inside your dwelling and locate the studs where you want to hang this thing and then transfer those marks onto your bracket using a drill bit we're going to pre-drill those holes ",

        "content": "4.5 billion years in the making. But it would have gone faster with Microjig Maker of the GRR-RIPPER. Work safer. Work smarter. I went through my scrap bin and pulled out a bunch of scrap pieces of half inch plywood for this project. And since this is a painted project, I don't have to worry about the grain direction or the color of the plywood matching. The main challenge to this project is that every piece is a different size. I'm going to start by making a bunch of rectangles. You can cut these out using any kind of saw\nyou happen to have. A circular saw... A jigsaw... A band saw... A table saw... Or you could even use a hand saw. Nah! Five of these pieces are squares. These are the shelves and I'm going to cut out the curves differently than I'm going to cut out the curves on the\nrectangles. The curve on each of the square shelves is just a quarter of a circle. To draw the circle, I'll find the center of the square by connecting the diagonals. The distance from the center of the square to the edge is the radius of the circle I'm\ngoing to draw. And I'm setting that using my beam compass. Cutting corners is easy with a jigsaw. Or a band saw. Or even a coping saw that I would hold like this if I had one. And there are all kinds of ways to sand these\ncurves smooth. But actually, when it comes down to it, most people just prefer using hand sandpaper and a little bit of elbow grease. Okay, I just totally made that up. One corner of each of the upright vertical\npieces gets a one inch radius. I'm going to join all of my shelves together using my pocket hole jig. I'm not really sure how to clamp this down while I put the screws in so I just put a board on top of the shelf so that I can push this up against it and hold it in place. I'll see if that works. I'm just trying to be super careful that I don't go so far that it comes through the other\nside. Those pocket screws will be hidden because this side goes against the wall. It's turning out really handy to have my plans available while I'm trying to put this all\ntogether so I can kind of visualize how it fits together. I really should have looked at those closer because this next shelf goes on like this and if I had really thought that through I would have drilled those holes at the same\ntime as these holes. But I guess it doesn;t really matter. It looks like I'm going to have to make up this clamping strategy as I go along but it looks like if I just lay this on its\nside, I can clamp this together and put the screws\nin. And really, that's the only tricky part about using pocket screws. You've got to clap your pieces together to hold them in place while you put the screws\nin or they'll just slide around. And I'm only putting these in until I feel a little bit of resistance. because they will go all the way through if I'm not careful. Now I can start working my way up. That was kind of tricky. After letting that sit overnight, it's surprisingly strong. Of course, you could certainly make those\njoints as complicated as you like. {Advertisement} I want to thank you all for watching this week's episode of Woodworking for Mere\nMortals.

        "content": "hello everybody today we're going to talk about how to make this beautiful bookshelf you started out with branches is constructed of three quarter-inch plywood sheets that have been glued together and one sheet to sheet and free sheet configurations it cut according to our schematic link in the description below now that we have our branches we need something for them to settle that's where this 3/4 inch thick sheet of plywood comes into so this going to be our backdrop we need to paint it you started out with a thick coat of primer to seal the plywood and to act as a base the brown page that we're going to add later after the primer was dry we added our deep brown coat we were looking for a stark contrast between the background and the tree that's why we opted for such an even shade of brown so we went ahead and laid out the Petri pieces according to this schematic and I'm going to do is attach them in order you that we need a drill with a small bit for pre drilling we're gonna need a larger bit for a countersink even screws and the researchers I'm using 2-inch screws right here because they're going to be going to reporter Andrew quarter inch plywood into the back of the tree branches and they need to go a decent on it and because the weight of the books is going to be pulling down on them like that first thing to do is to line up your boards in the correct place to make sure they're square that way that we know our board is square against the face edge here once we have our rulers lined up right stick board away and we're going to drill several holes on the bottom side so we know from the back how we're going to drill now you want to realign up the board set it in the correct place and then even going to the bottom use a thin bit to pre-trip so you don't crack the plywood use a thicker bit to countersink the screws you're now good to sink your first set of screws this is where it's important to make sure that your branches are very flush flat otherwise when you screw them in will tilt the turn we wanted to hide all the screws so they wouldn't be visible from the front this one will be covered up by a branch and is good to add structural support the base of the tree we started by fixing the main chunk to the background first this importance of the rest of the branches line up accordingly to fix these Peaks we would first put it up to the piece before and then line you decide with rulers so we know how wide the piece was piece is then taken away and holes are drilled for the tops of the plywood this is so we know where to drill in from the bottom when we replace see screwing each branch end will take time you have to be careful about its placement so the gaps between each branch are not accentuated when you screw the next it's nice to have a friend to help you set the boards and two tables to put the plywood on so you can get underneath the board's easily since you have to use three sets of drill bits it's also nice if you have several drills so you don't have to keep swapping your bids up okay so we built the tree eight feet tall thought it would be good enough but then when we tried to stick it into the room it was too tall like smashing the ceiling so we're gonna take off about three inches off the top and we already set up our jig right here it's going to guide the skill saw so we can lop off a full three inches and then call it good hopefully this works after some measuring malfunctions we are closed not me that was definitely on me we're going to sand the top of the tree sand all the surfaces of the tree to make a nice smooth finish and to prep the surface for polyurethane later once you finish sanding wipe down the entire tree with a damp rag to ensure the no dust left aligned we're back to brush on some polyurethane just up right here because we got a tree you know it's all sanded and pretty and we just want red X and make it all nice and dust free so I'm about to get started here what do you set it up this is good it was it well yeah this is pretty bad make sure in a ventilated area not like this garage that we're in if we're dead by the end of this that's why so full disclosure do this outside please so um let's get started and I'm putting it on the wood right now but we're also going to put it on the paint protect the paint also yeah really is that your plans okay you just do polyurethane makes for a nice clean protective coat swivel raised rough Birds when it's finished dry so make sure and go over it with a light piece of sandpaper and it under working dine yeah I now took forever just the last wee little bit right here we totally upgraded our security check that bad boy out wipe in those toxic fumes out of this place any feeling pretty lightheaded right now huh after the polyurethane dried we started to make the brace on the wall where we were going to place the bookshelf we found the studs in the wall and screwed to two experts into them we didn't marked on the back of the tree where those two mentors met when they the tree down and then screwed another two set of two by fours and to the back of the tree instead the tree against it again and then screw the two by fours into each other we did this so as not to have screws coming straight in from front of tree you hey guys thanks for watching the project was great in it was a lot of fun yeah and if you like what we did here today go ahead and subscribe to our Channel we'll be throwing some more videos your way and if you have a good idea of something that we should be making put in the comment section below and we'll see if we can get to it thanks for watching guys ",

        "content": "hello and welcome to my workshop my name is Chris Pine today's project is going to be a fairly simple wall shelf for my son's room I'm going to put it above the head of his bed the wood that i will be using is some red oak that i salvaged from an old bunk bed that actually used to be in that very same room and my my two sons used to use that bunk bed a few years ago the thing had gotten to where it was just almost falling down so i took it apart we got him some different beds but I always kept that lumber because it was perfectly good but we're going to use it today make a wall shelf let's get started you can see just my really high-tech planning material here and I've made a basic drawing of the side of the shelf these shelves will be 11 inches here this is the side where the Shelf will go in so 11 inches deep 11 inches tall i should say another one at 11 inches tall and then this one approximately eight inches tall and they will also be approximately 11 inches in depth this way as well as this one see the cut that I make here makes this one about 6 inches so it's a fairly simple shelf project and I've traced out on the wood here if you can see the lines where those dedos are going to go this is one of the side pieces and I've got the down here at the bottom if you look this is going to be the part that tapers down at the bottom and we'll cut that out probably with the jigsaw but first I need to cut these dedos and to do that I'm going to go to my dado head cutter on the table saw okay I got the first dado cut on the side piece and here's one of the shelves just to see how that fits beautiful Leah would ended up being about 11 16 since thick so my dado is cut accordingly and the way that I cut the day though some may have a problem with that and that's fine we all have our way of doing things when we have to have personal responsibility I just use the fence when I cut this data just like this and it's a half inch deep and I just pushed it through up against the fence now as long as you hold on to this piece of wood and you're careful there should be no issue doing it that way however I say to you whatever you're not comfortable with do not do so if you have to make a sled to do this then do so but for me this is fine it worked out great so I'm going to cut the other day toes and we'll move on from there I Drive fit the pieces together that I have thus far I need to make some I need to glue up some pieces for the top otherwise this is a hundred percent of the recycled material that i got from the bunk bed here is the glue up for the top which i had to use some new lumber to do that with on the front edge of these shelves i wanted to round the corners over so i just traced a profile here around and then cut it with the bandsaw and I'm sanding it smooth so that ought to be nice just to keep from kid catching his head on it or something my favorite part we're ready for some assembly at this point ok I'm going to put this back piece on with the screws in the pocket holes and now the unit upside down with the bottom laying on the floor and I've got to get down here and install I've got it lined up I need to get down and installed the pocket hole screws into the top now and to do that I'm going to use a little smaller drill because I have a smaller area to work in with the square headed bit on the finish that I used for the bookshelf was polyurethane semi-gloss polyurethane and i dilute it down with some paint thinner I think it absorbs into the wood a lot better I put three coats and I just buff between with an abrasive pad between each coat and I even use a little paste wax at the end to give it a little more protection even after the finish has fully cured and it's time to go hang this on the wall so let's go see if we can get that done okay it's hung on the wall I just put a few things up there I'm sure it'll be full of junk relatively fast anyway neat little project I'm sure they'll get a lot of use out of it another project complete recycle the wood from a bunk bed it would get a lot of use in my son's room I'm pretty happy with how it turned out thanks so much for watching I'd appreciate a like on the video if you're not a subscriber I would invite you to subscribe so you don't miss any of my future videos for those of you who are loyal subscribers thank you very much I appreciate the support have a great week god bless we'll see you next time you ",

        "original_title": "Build Simple Floating Shelves",
        "content": "it's time to do the shelves on the north wall of the kitchen and I'd like to have these shelves float on the wall so that they won't attach to the to the side wall or they won't have any brackets underneath I thought about making a box so that you sort of have the vertical piece to help hold the shelves up but but what I really wanted these to do was to float the method I wanted to use was to use steel pins that would go into the studs in the wall and then come out and go into the shelf and hold the Shelf up I needed to find the studs but even more than that I needed to find the center of each stud so that my pins would be centered on them and not near the side I didn't want to a pin that was sort of half in the stud or you know sort of mostly in the stud I wanted them really centered so I used several different methods to find the studs first by knocking on the wall and then a little bit of the stud finder and then measuring to kind of check to make sure they were there they're 16 inches on center before I had covered the wall up I had marked on a 2 by 4 where the studs were so so I used that as well to check to see whether I was close and things were making sense but in the end what I did to really make sure I was centered on each stud was to find the edge of the stud by drilling holes into the wall I figured that the Shelf would cover up the holes that I was drilling so it really wasn't that big steel that I was putting holes in the wall I could drill a hole about where I thought the edge was and find a spot where there wasn't a stud and then where there was a stud and then I would know that the edge was between those two holes and then from there I could measure over to the center of the stud so to do the pins and to get them in the same place on both the shelf and the I made a stick basically a story stick for the project so I cleaned up a 2x4 and got it nice and straight and nice and square then once I had that I could mark where to drill the holes in 2x4 based on where the Centers of the studs were I could then drill the holes into the 2x4 as straight and a square to the 2x4 as I could I got this long drill bit that's the same diameter as the steel that I got for the pins so that I could go through the 2x4 and then into the wall now I figured if I just held the 2x4 on the wall and tried to drill the holes it would move so what I did was mounted the 2x4 to the wall with screws so that it was in place and it wouldn't move between each hole as I drilled them I figured out the depth that I was going to need to do which for the studs was basically making sure that I didn't drill all the way through the wall so that to my for both spaces the holes but it also holds the drill square to the wall and I can pull the 2x4 down now I'll make the pins I got a 5/8 inch steel rod for this I found the sawzall with a miter box actually works really well for cutting steel and I cleaned up a little burr on the cut and then I could put the pins in the wall and it seemed fairly square and I tapped them in there fairly tight I'm not sure I can get these out at some point in the future I need to now for the actual shelves we've got a thicker piece of bamboo plywood it it's the 5-ply sheet so it's an inch and a half thick and it's heavy that's 8 feet by 26 inches I think so it's a little smaller than a full sheet the cutting was easy it was more that pushing the weight on the sled it was what was difficult I had to jerry-rig the clamp on the sled just a little bit and cut the shelves I first cut the length and then I cut the two widths that I needed and that's basically the woodworking on this project so then I took the same 2x4 story stick with the holes in it and clamp that to the edge of the shelf and I can then drill the holes into the shelf and I'll they'll both be spaced correctly and have the same angle hopefully if there's any tiny variation off of 90 it'll be part of the stick when doing this I started with my cordless drill which was working but it was slow so I tried the corded drill and not that worked a lot for this now something that was in the back of my mind up to this point was that if I if I was drilling holes in the wall and in the Shelf that were both tight to the pins my story stick wasn't going to be accurate enough for everything to slide together with the holes and the pins that type when I took the Shelf up to try and put it in there there was just no way it was going on like that so I went and got a little bit bigger drill bit I think it's 11 16 so sort of the next size up and I drilled out the holes in the shelf this gave me the little bit of wiggle room in the holes to allow the pins to slide onto the shelf on the wall but still kept it tight enough that the shelves weren't loose on them on the pins something I'd wanted to do all along was to put lights under the shelves so the idea was to cut a slot in the bottom of the shelf and put an LED strip light into that slot so with the router I cut a slot on the bottom of the shelf now it's turned out where the lighting in the kitchen is actually pretty bright and I really don't need the lights under the shelves but I figured this has been the idea all along so I'm going to go with it and then some finish I sanded just before this I think with 220 and then three 20 the same as the cabinets and with these I did all six sides so you can see how the shelves just slide onto the pins and held in place so those two wires that have been sticking out of the wall for the whole kitchen project are for the lights that go under the shelves so I stuck the lights into the slot and they seemed to work although that the next morning when we got up part of part of the light was starting to come down so I I'm thinking I'm going to have to figure out how to attach the lights better to the wood like some hot glue or something better better glue than than the sticky that's on the lights and the slot on the upper shelf casts a funny shadow on the wall that I don't really like so I made go back and cut that slot a little wider so that edge isn't in the way I'm testing his shadow so it worked it took a lot of fiddling to get the the pins to work and get the shelves to kind of sit right and and to get the lights to work but but they look good in the end when we were first envisioning these I was figuring the plates would go on these as well and the shelves would be 10 inches deep but when we started to really think about that it seemed it seemed really big and whether whether we really needed to do that so we ended up going with 6-inch shelves and just using them for cups and possibly small bowls so the shelves are sort of half storage half art on the wall away so so we need to make sure that what goes up there looks good I guess because it's totally open thanks for watching ",

        "content": "hey guys this week I built some floating shelves in my studio closet stick around and I'll show you how this project is sponsored by liquid nails fuse it I built the ribs for my floating shelves out of 2x2 lumber using liquid nails fuse it adhesive and 3-inch cabinet screws driven into the studs in the wall I applied the liquid nails fuse it to the wall or the board or both and then press the board to the wall and the instant grab acted as a third hand and held my 2x2 in place until I was able to secure the 2x2 with screws I set up my laser level for each shelf to give me a level line to reference as I was installing each shelf all the shelves will be secured to the wall on three sides on the side of the shelves that ran into the angled ceiling I use my table saw and cut those shelf supports at an angle to match the ceiling and then I wet both surfaces before I applied my liquid nails fuse it because it makes it bond faster I used some nails and one screw because that's the only stud that I could hit on that side which is an additional reason why I need the extra strength of the adhesive and I'm not bothering with drilling pocket holes I'm just driving myself drilling self tapping screws in at an angle and for the most part they work really well without splitting the wood although sometimes it happens and when that did occur I just bumped up the bracing with an extra block and then drove in an extra screw I'm using a big glob of adhesive and one screw in each joint and when you get the adhesive on the wall if you get it before it dries it wipes right off after attaching the front of the shelves I put in all of the dividers I used the adhesive and screws but I only attach the front screw until all of the dividers were in place because I was pulling forward on that front piece to allow me to slide the divider in without scraping off all of the adhesive while I slid it into play I used a clamp to keep both surfaces flush with each other while I drove a screw in at an angle through the divider and into the back cleat I built three 10 inch deep floating shelves on the main wall and then one deeper shelf against the back wall under the slanted ceiling after I built the 2x2 skeletons I put plywood on the top and bottom of each shelf I used quarter inch plywood for the bottoms and half inch plywood for the tops I applied a bead of liquid Mills fuse it along the perimeter and the dividers and then press the plywood into place the bond held really well so I just shot some 23 gauge pin nails in there to hold it in place and make sure it stayed until the adhesive set the bottom shelf is over 8 feet long so I had a seam I just made sure that I cut both pieces to end in the center of a divider so that I could shoot nails into the divider on both ends of the seam I used liquid nails fuse it and nails on all of my shelves and just repeated the process until it was finished I did bevel the ends of the angled shelves so that they fit nicely into place I used primed pine 1 by 3s for my friends and they put adhesive on the 2 by 2 and tried to squiggle it onto the top fly wood as well because I wanted to bond that face to both of those surfaces then I used my 16 gauge nail gun and shot some nails into the face to make sure that it stayed in place until the adhesive had time to cure the larger shelf in the back of the room was a little bit trickier I used half inch plywood on the top and the bottom to add a little extra strength but that extra weight on the bottom made it heavier and harder to hold in place without any extra clamps so it was a little tricky I had to take a little rest after that activity before finishing up the room I was thinking after I got the flooring installed I put a brace under this one I don't want it in the way while I'm trying to sell a flooring because this clause is small enough area already don't want to have to be working around a raisin that I can put step to Ben's high underneath here and over here I'm planning on having some I don't know honestly what I'm going to put in here right now I'm going to take all of the tools that I have laying all over the place in the rest of my studio and put them into your very nicely and then when I'm done building my studio put other stuff in here that's my plan so that's it for today thanks for watching about we'll see you next time ",

        "content": "hey guys john here from so woodsy comm here to show you how to build and install a floating shelf as a resident homes comm DIY expert i'm going to show you how to complete your next do-it-yourself project let's get started this is the location where i'm going to install the floating shelf I went ahead and drew up a little drawing of what the location is got my cabinets the window the location where I'm going to sell the shelf so I want to go ahead and get some rough measurements I plan on the Shelf being two and a half inches thick I'm going to use a half inch plywood layer on top and a half inch plywood layer on the bottom this way I'll sandwich it and this will create a stiff shelf and sturdy enough to hold Katie's cookbooks or decor or whatever she plans on doing in the kitchen so let's all go ahead out to the woodshop and go ahead and make this Here I am in the workshop I've already went ahead and precut all my pieces of lumber and I already started assembling the shelf I'm going to go ahead and run through and show you exactly what I did to make this shelf I use regular stock 1 by 3 pine you get at your local hardware store and then some half-inch plywood so this is the floating shelf I took the 1 by 3 pine use it as my faceplate then I took some extra 1 by 3 pine I ripped it long ways to make it one-and-a-half inches thick I made a simple box frame with butt joints nailed it together and glued it create this frame I went ahead and used some pocket screws here and along this bottom piece to attach to the faceplate this way when you're looking at the shop from the front you don't see any nails or any screw holes I took this extra piece so one and a half inch put it here all along the faceplate this way when I go ahead and attach my top board the bottom boards I don't get any sag when I go ahead and put books or anything else on top of this shelf this is going to be the top piece of my shelf all just going to do is I'm out it I'll drop it into place and that'll be it the books are sitting on shut on on top of the shelf here as you can see 1/2 inch 1/2 inch one and a half inch piece that I ripped creates two and a half inches that's my one by three I'm going to go ahead and take this off real quick and show you I went ahead and kept the top piece off because the shelves up high so you're not going to see it so I wanted to make sure the bottom looked perfect so when I go ahead and put it in place I'm going to mouth two screws on each side and some tap cons in the back I'll show you what that is later and then I'm going to go ahead and now go ahead and paint this up okay this shelf is dry I've already wedged it in place it was a tight fit so it's not even screwed up right now it's just holding in there between the two cabinet because this thirty nine and a quarter inch was extremely tight so I've already leveled it out so I'm going to be ready to screw it in I'm going to use inch and a quarter screws to screw from the side into the side of the cabinet making sure that screws are not too long that they're going to go inside the cabinet and then earlier I was talking about tap cons and tap con is a concrete screw so I'll have to use a concrete bit a 3/16 for these screws the reason I'm using them is because this is the exterior wall of the house so our house is block so I'm going to go ahead and use the tap cons if you have if you're using a mounting it to a different wall on the house where you actually have wooden studs you can go ahead and use regular wood screws just make sure you attach this shelf to the stud because it will need the support to hold it up so let's get started make sure you double check when you before you screw that everything is level so I'm just making sure I'm level where I go ahead and sink these screws in all right now we go ahead and drill the back wall and add the tap conscience so you need a high-speed drill with a hammer setting all right just finish drilling the wall I'm going to go ahead and install the tap cons now go ahead and change out the bit put it on the medium setting all right take my tab con right into my pre-drilled hole and then right there perfect all right so I'm gonna take my top board and I'm going to just drop it right into place perfect perfect fit all right looks good so I'm gonna get Kate in here let's go ahead and decorate this so excited to finally have storage for all my cookbooks all right guys that's how you build and install a floating shelf on behalf of homes comm I'm John and thanks for watching I hope I've inspired you to tackle your next do-it-yourself project you ",

Spanish cedar I'm not quite sure but it was broken it was cracked literally cracked all the way like kind of caught halfway up and so I thought maybe I could use the very bottom as a stump and maybe make this stump into its seat but as soon as I cut it I realized the crack goes all the way through to the very bottom and I pull it out and I go let me go back and take a look and see what else I could take out of this tree and so here you see me taking part of the crack and you can see it's all whether the split was it was split for many years the wind was blowing the tree would create because of that crack I cut it down about a month ago and once I finally looked at the stump I realized it's completely rotted anyway so I couldn't do much with that stump and so I look back at the long piece and I bring it to the shop and I stopped to think about what I could do with it and I realized well maybe at least I'll flatten it and so I start chopping into it I see how beautiful the redwood is underneath it is this this red beautiful cedar not to mention it smells really beautiful as well it's the same type of cedar you would put in a closet again to keep them all this away or like you might smell in a hamster cage so I start chopping it and I realize it's a good opportunity for me to use a flattening jig actually a fine woodworking featured a flattening Jake that nick offerman often uses to flatten big slabs and I realized that I want to get this at least somewhat level before I decide to use the flattening Jake so that's what I'm using my hatchet that I made in a previous video actually made the hatchet handle the head was existing and I just continue to flat it's actually quite satisfying to chop the wood like that in both directions it's kind of how you can human a beam chop to one direction then you go against the grain in the other direction and the chunks just literally fly away so now I got it down to a pretty good level and I put these rails on these rails about seven inches high and I've screwed the log to the table and a couple of key spots and now there's my carriage the carriage is going to carry the router and there's the router and that router has a 1 and 1/8 inch bit on it and there I'm just testing it this is a late one night and then I'm going to cross dissolve into the next morning where I'm wearing a different shirt so there's the next morning and my intern Matt he's holding my vacuum and as he put it inside trying to sweep up during a ticker-tape parade there's just really almost no way to control the the chips that fly off not to mention it smells really really good and then David reminded me we have this brand new bed which was much sharper so he threw it on the table and brought it to my attention so I changed the bed now the carriage is a little rubbing on the log so I had to take some more down I'm testing it so that's why this allows the carriage we hit that and so here I go this is the first pass which took the most material away so I'm going slow back and forth and I hit a knot right there and it's kind of satisfied it's like a CNC machine when it starts to get really quick when it gets to a small cut right there and then I decided to try and leave the log as natural as possible and the more I dig into this I realized what I'm going to do with this is making a floating shelf it wasn't my very first idea now that's it that's actually a cool shot with the new GoPro session I had it just hot glue it up underneath the carriage I had it wrapped with gaffers tape and then I hot-glued the gaffers tape to the carriage and now here we go with sanding it that's my hands Sam with 80 grit you've taken it down through the grits and then I let my intern Alan take over the sander and I'm kind of guiding him while he's sanding so that's me still and now you see ours does Alan's hands and so we go from 80 to 120 the to 20 and then you suck it into the 400 grits and we work it all the way up towards 4000 now that's a 4000 grit absolutely no finish and we'll still have a nice beautiful shine so there's no finish I was afraid to put a finish on it because I didn't want it to kill the smell that beautiful smell that that cedar put out these are old brackets that I didn't need anymore I just needed that 3/4 inch steel rod so now here I'm making a jig this is a jig for two reasons I need this jig I need to drill holes parallel on the table into the log this is going to be how I fastened it to a wall it's going to be a floating shelf I've decided and so there are use a 2x4 now I'm using an auger bit and a drill press which is kind of dangerous so that's what I'm kind of using it at a high speed the high speed keeps it from screwing in and there's a steel chunk I use to kind of transfer my my clamping to the table there and now that I have my holes pathway through the 2x4 I'm drilling into the log itself this gives me the opportunity to go parallel to the table which is a sort of perpendicular to level and now there's my steel rod and I do the same thing down the way and I pull the jig out now because it's kind of in the way to go deep so once I've got my hole started I can then go a little bit deeper go and I blow the air out I blow the chips out begin to blow the chips out see how deep I am now here's that that same exact piece of wood and I'm using it to to mark my holes on the wall at 40 inches high and the top of that jig is actually the same height is the surface of the shelf once it's in place so it gives me a good guide so I'm drilling into this cinderblock it's extremely hard so I go down to a smaller hole which it's a little bit easier and then I want to get that hole deep enough I go to the bigger hole so I'm removing a little bit of material in the center then the material around the outside and I'm going to epoxy those rods in place I'm using just five-minute epoxy and I'm using West Systems micro filler and blow the holes out get rid of all the dust in there and I scoop in the epoxy and I want it to squish out and there you see it's squish out they set a level on it and then I put stick on over the clamp so now that's going to dry level to the earth now working on the other hole just down the way put the epoxy in I want to feel squish out clamp it up level let it dry and now the other ones already starting to cure epoxy goes through a hardening phase where you can kind of carve it so before it gets too hard I can carve it with my knife and that's what I'm doing there same thing on this side I won't and grab the beater chisel there just makes it a little bit easier to get in that corner but again epoxy goes through a curing phase you want to get it right when it's at that curing phase you don't want it to let it get too hard because then you really need to whack at it just painting that black just to make them a little bit more discrete because they're going to mostly be covered and I go to put the shelf on it I realize those two things are kind of sprung a little left and right which actually is a good thing because it's snugged onto the log so I didn't need to do anything else to the Lobby really snug down there pretty good so that we have a mantle and natural live edge mantel on both sides I even left the chain saw marks and my friend Kelly and Alaska made me that really cool license plate Alaska pick I'm gonna come up on Instagram and there's my aluminum axe and there's a lamp I made many years ago half of the power goes directly through the steel of the wrench so there it is a live edge shelf made from cedar you ",

        "content": "Hey Everybody we're back in the garage. I've already shown you how to do that suspended\noverhead shelf and my workbench. You can see it's already getting filled up with stuff. Now the third stage of my shelving system\nis going to be some corner shelves. We've got 600 mm or 2 ft apart. 3 of them, nothing on the concrete floor. What I'm going to do though is have an angled\nfront because I've got a door here and I want to be able to swing it right past with the\nshelves in behind and on a similar angle to the open door. I don't want the shelves coming out on a square\nangle because they will dig into the door. Your tools for today's job are all good quality\nhand tools, square, hammer, tape measure, ear muffs, once again we're going to be using\nbugle batten screws with an appropriate drill. We'll need a power saw and a good quality\nlevel and also today we'll need a good quality saw to cut those angles. Let's get into it, first of all we're going\nto do the cleats just like I've done the cleats up here with bugle batten screws. You can watch those videos to watch how I've\nattached the cleats. I've already marked out the levels so I attach\nthe cleats and then it's just a matter of measuring the same style of chipboard for\nthe shelves, cut to 90 degrees in the corners and 45 degrees on the externals, with a 2\nx 1 on the face to protect the front of the shelf. We measure the length from the internal corner\nto the outside of both corners and cut our sheet accordingly with a right angle and two 45's. There is the finished product. Give it a test run. There you go. You can see how the door is going to fit nicely\nacross that instead of the shelf sticking out and hitting the door. So I'll apply some glue and fix the shelf down. Do the second and the third one as well. Then put the 2 x 1 on the front. This is the timber I'm using 42 x 19. It gives a bit of strength to that front of the shelf. It is already quite strong being supported\nfirmly on both sides. So the timber gives a bit more strength and\nprotects the chipboard edge. Glue and nailed on. Fitting a nail in to the support and into the shelf. This ensures the shelf is fully supported. Three extra strong shelves ready to take any\nload and I can swing the door open quite freely and right out of the way with good access\nfor those who want to come in that way. Check out more of my building and construction videos. Thanks for watching guys and I'll see you\nagain very soon. ",

To make this job even easier, I've got all\nmy timber precut at Bunnings. To attach my shelf support to my shelf, I\nneed to make sure it's centered and flush with the back of the shelf, and then pre-drill\nthree holes. I'm just gonna use a bit of glue to provide\nsome extra strength before screwing my shelf support to my shelf. Drive the three screws below the surface of\nthe timber as we're gonna use putty to conceal them for a nice finish. To finish off, you can either stain or paint. We're gonna be staining it. Decide where you're gonna position your shelves,\nand then make two marks for your wall anchors using a spirit level. Once the wall anchors are in, position your\nshelf and drive the screws into the wall. As you can see, it was a very easy process\nfor an outstanding result. Remember our bare bedroom wall before?

        "content": "hello everyone in this video I'm going to show you how to install a wall shelf okay so what you're going to need is you're going to need your shelf this is mine you're going to need a drill you're going to need a stud finder which I got from Lowe's and I also got the drill from Lowe's you're going to need a tape measure some tape scissors a hammer now most shelves come with this hardware already mine did not because I got mine at the thrift store so I just went to Lowe's and I picked up this kit and it came with the drill bit and it came with the screws and anchors and it was on sale for $3 so that was a good deal so now I'm going to show you how to install this so the first thing you're going to do is turn your shelf over on the back side of your shelf there's going to be holes that are there to help you hang it on the wall okay so first thing to make this really easy what you're going to do is you're going to take your tape and I'm using this black electrical tape but you can use whatever you want and what you're going to do is you're going to start your tape right in the center of that hole okay and then you're just going to run this tape all the way down to the center of the other hole okay so let me show you that so just run your tape all the way down and essentially what you're doing is you're taking the measurement from hole to hole and what you're going to do is once you get this cut okay you're going to UM put this on the wall so that's all you need to do for that now I'll show you what you do with it on the wall okay so the first thing you'll have to do is determine whether or not there's a stud in the wall a stud is just a solid piece of wood behind the drywall okay if there's a stud there you won't need an anchor so you could just go straight into the drywall and the stud with the screw if there's no stud there then you have to use an anchor so the way this works is basically basically just hold us down on the wall when it beeps then I can just start moving when they find a stud in the wall what it's going to do is it's going light up and let me know that there's a stud there there's a stud right there so I'm going to mark that so I'll know just in case that that's where I want to put my piece I'll know that there's a stud right there and I'll just keep moving there's another stud right there will you back it up okay and then I'll keep moving okay and then there's a stud on the end so now next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to determine where I want to put my shelf on the wall okay so I want to put it 12 inches from 12 inches from this molding right here so I'm going to measure 12 inches up okay so I want it to be I wanted to be about right here okay so I'm going to make a mark right here that's what I want it to start okay so I'm going to get my shelf here and I know that I want it to end at 12 inches so I've already made that mark on the wall right there so I'm going to hole up my shelf and then I'm going to mark where one of these goals one of these holes is so I know that one of the holes is right here you can't see it on the camera but I'm just going to mark one hole right here okay and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that tape that black tape that we measured and I'm going to put it right here for one end then I'm going to put it over here for the other end what this is going to tell me is where I need to drill my holes okay let's make sure the holes are going to be level so I'm going to take my tape measure and I'm going to measure from here to here okay and I'm going to make sure that they're the exact same height so this one is about fourteen and this one is this slide is too high I'm going to bring this side down a little bit I'll make sure this is right at 14 and a half right there this is at 14 and a half so now I know exactly where my holes need to be so now I can take out my drill and insert my anchor and insert my screw I'm not going to I have to use an anchor because this is not where my studs are my studs are right here okay so I'll show you how I do that I have already installed my drill bit here on my drill so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to drill my holes okay so now I know that a hole has to go here and then another hole has to go at the very end okay so I will go ahead and do that okay that's the first one then come down here I'm going to do exactly the same thing okay so now I'm just going to kind of brush that off I'm going to take the tape off early and now I'm going to take these anchors okay these anchors came in my kit and it looked like this I'm just going to insert them in the hole if you can't push them all the way in the hole which fingers you can use a hammer to push them in the wall okay so this is pretty really simple to do I've done this tons and tons of times and never fails I had to get a Phillips head screwdriver because um I didn't have the right bit for my drill so anyway you just take a regular Phillips head screwdriver and that's the one that has the points on it okay um and you're just going to screw this in typically I screw it in pretty far because what's going to happen is your shelf is going to be resting on the head of these screws so you don't want it out too far because then this shelf is going to be too loose I usually put it down to like maybe two turns left in it and then I'll do the same thing to the other side now show you how English oh okay so what you want to do now look like I show you this I've already installed one side right here what you want to do is get one side in and then once you get one side in and you're gonna kind of feel and get the other side pushed in okay going pretty easy once you get one side in that's kind of the trick to it now I do have two of these shelves to install so that's what it looks like what's this up on the wall and it's a very very easy project I want to thank everybody for watching and I will see you in the next video you ",

        "content": "hey guys I'm finishing up my pantry shelves when you last saw I had installed 3/4 inch plywood ribs now I'm going to be adding plywood to the top and bottom I'm using 1/2 inch plywood on the top and quarter inch on the bottom I use my track saw to rip down the 8-foot pieces of plywood and then used my table set to trim to fit I cut all of the plywood pieces down in my workshop and then brought them upstairs and trim to fit on the miter sod that I have in the house I had described several of the shelves because the walls just aren't straight and that's when that miter saw comes in handy it's a lot easier to trim it in my kitchen than to go all the way down to the workshop every time I need to make a little cut the first shelf I set in place and nailed down with my battery-powered nail gun but the consecutive shelves mine L couldn't didn't fit in all of the cavities so I used wood glue clamps weights my nail gun when it would fit I just didn't want to have to haul my air compressor down which I ended up having to do later anyway so I should have just made it easier on myself oh well I've got my quarter inch bottoms and primed and sanded them before installation it's easier to get as many steps done as possible before installation because painting wallets upside down is not the easiest thing and speaking of installation I used wood glue and a smaller nail gun which fit easily in between all of the cavities which I had to haul my air compressor down for so yeah I should have hauled it down to begin with and saved myself a little trouble on the first step after all of my tops and bottoms are installed I used my wood patch and filled all of the nail holes and patched my scenes I thought it would be a little bit easier to do now than after the faces are on because the faces will have a half inch overhang on the bottom of the shelves I faced my shelves with 1x3 poplar using wood glue and Brad nails to secure them they are flush on the top with a half inch overhang on the bottom and simple but joints no miter is necessary because they're going to be painted in the end yes of course they are once all my wood patch was dry i sanded and sanded and sanded I can't stress enough the importance of prepping your project for finish it's one of the most important steps that there is it can make your project look awesome or like a total fail so I sanded vacuumed wiped and then looked for anything else that I could see and filled again and then waited some more and then sand it again after that was dry I cleaned it all up and then I primed after priming I sanded everything again the power sander on the flat surfaces and a sanding sponge by hand to knock down any sharp edges then I wiped everything down and Kolb I made sure the caulk was dry and wipe down the shelves really well before I painted I used a high-gloss paint and painted it on with a brush and a microfiber roller I did two coats and I do not stand in between coats and I get a really smooth finish this way I think the key is light coats and don't overwork the surface I am so excited about how this turned out I love it and you have all kinds of paint or coal in my hair I guess I'll be wearing a hat for a while thanks for watching and I will see you next time ",

        "content": "hi everybody I'm Leo CJ trill and today I'm going to show you how to build one of these now what is this this is called a floating shop and I got to tell you there's nothing better if you want to showcase a collection of islands you may have so let's get in the workshop let's get started okay so this is what we need to get started so what is it well it's a hollow-core door and it's 30 inches wide now we're going to have to take the door and we're going to cut it down the middle well maybe not exactly down the middle because we want to cut a shelf that's going to be appropriately sized so let's get started we're going to go over to the table saw before you get started just make certain that you have an outfeed table set up behind the table saw okay so that's our cut that's a nice clean cut gonna turn it on its side so you can see what we've got here now remember I said was a hollow core door so these pieces here you say they're just cardboard that's what I'm gonna have to do is gonna have to cut away some of the cardboard to make room for the cleat okay so I've got a utility knife here this is just cardboard what we're going to do is we're just kind of cut away some of the cardboard what it's gonna do is it gonna it's going to give us room for the crease okay okay so there's a little bit of remnants of the cardboard what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take up a razor blade a safety blade and just spread that off and smooth it and you're going to want to repeat that process wherever you find remnants of the cardboard now keep in mind we're going to insert the cleat into the cavity of the door and you want to give yourself about an inch to two inches worth of clearance here from the top of that door for where the cardboard is so just cut away about two inches okay so now it's time to cut our cleat so we need to measure the distance between okay it's about an inch in 1/16 but we're going to cut it so it's an inch and 1/8 because we want a snug fit so you're probably saying wait wait you're cutting the cleat a little thicker than the cavity in the door hey that's fine because the the skin of the door is flexible what that cleat could be as snug as possible okay so this is the clean and we want to make certain that we drive fit to clean inside the cavity of the the shelf and because you don't want to get this thing secured to the wall and then find out your cleat doesn't fit so that's what I'm doing right now I'm just doing a dry fit okay so I've got my cleat inserted I know that it fits I don't want to push it all the way down because then I'll have a hard time removing it and we need to remove it so we can secure it to the wall okay now I've determined where I want the shelf to be placed on the wall now what we have to do is our next step is we have to determine where the studs are and we're going to use a stud finder to do that okay so I'm going to put the stud finder on the wall turn it on allow it to calibrate it's calibrated now now I'm going to start moving it across until I locate my stud well there's one stud there so I'm going to mark it so they keep going down don't find my next stud someone else stood right there I'll mark that okay as you can see I've located the studs of beneath the surface of the drywall now I know where I need to attach the cleat okay so what I've done here is I've got to clean I'm holding it up against our reference line it's gonna let me know where I need to pre-drill holes in the cleat so I'll tap directly into my stud and I won't split the pine because I'm pre drilling now I'm going to use a structural screw you can use a lag screw if you like but this is a good alternative I like because it tends not to split the wood okay so when you drill a pilot hole just make certain that the drill bit that you're using is smaller in diameter than the diameter of the screw that you're going to use to attach the cleat just make certain that you clamp the wood down before you start to drill okay so now it comes time to attach the cleat to the wall we're just going to line up our pilot holes with stud Center remember stud Center is the center of the stud can you see why now I love these structural screws they're just an easy install and they secure whatever you're attaching to the studs and this is what it should look like now what you want to do is you want to apply wood glue to the inside of the end bead you don't be generous with it mixing you get the top as well here okay I want to give you like three different fastener choices and the reason for that is I you know you never know what a homeowner has in terms of equipment ideally you would want to use a pneumatic nailer with a compressor but not most homeowners have something like that around the house so what we're going to be using today is we're going to be using a cabinet screw and it looks like that looks a little bit like a drywall screw the other thing you could do is you could use a wire Brad that's what this is that might be a little challenging nailing it in but it's a good choice it can be a good choice if a hammer is all you have next up this is more like a finishing screw what makes it different is it has a smaller head now it's time to put the shelf in place so we're going to slide now remember we did a dry fit so we know that it fits but it may not be effortless we could have to you know fool around a little bit here's the thing it's important to get a nice snug fit you don't want to have a gap between the shelf in the wall so you might have to wrap it with a hammer but you don't want to damage the shelf itself so just make something to use a piece of scrap wood make your taps that way you're not worried about you know damaging the shelf itself now I'm going to just use a cordless screwdriver to drive the screw into the cleat now make certain you repeat the process down the length of the shelf all about every 12 inches and don't forget to get the underside so we're all finished I got to tell you I'm pretty happy with the results there's no better place display a collection like my tribal mask here than on a floating shelf now I stay in my shelf you may want to paint yours or you may just want to leave it natural the choice is yours this is Leah saying you can do this see you next time you ",

        "content": "hey everyone my name is Matt welcome to my son's nursery today I'm going to show you how I made these really simple floating wall shelves out of a reclaimed right ok to buy for now a few years ago my wife and I went to pick up some reclaimed lumber for a project that she was working on and I picked up a lot of extra stuff just because it was so cheap and I figured I have a use for it in the future sometime so I've had this stuff sitting around for a while now and I figured this would be the perfect project for a few of those pieces so I got a couple of these boards that I thought would work for this project but I ended up only using one of them anyway I started by standing a face and an edge of the board and those are going to become the bottom and the front edge of the shelf if my wife wants needs to be about three feet long each and she wants two of them so this one here is going to be pretty good for that this is 70 inches to the bottom of this notch cut that was here for whatever this used to be proud of like a roof Raptor or something structural in the in a barn or whatever so I think that work out pretty well can cut this down to 35 inch pieces and like give me my two shelves it's also going to include those nail holes and one of them which I think are really cool they have a nice look to them so now British Argyle of nails out but we shall find out for sure so I'm just going to cut these real quick with the jigsaw just to cut them down to rough size and then later on I'll come back and clean up these cut edges so if the joint or I'm going to clean up one faced in one edge and not get too much I'm squirted to each other and those are going to be the top and the back side of the piece so I on the wall you'll still have this cool rustic look on the top and bottom but the pieces you have on the shelf will have a nice flat place to sit so now that I have my reference corner I'll use that on my crosscut sled to not only square them up but also cut them to length so my wife would also like a small lip on the front edge of the shelf so at the table saw I'm gonna use my ripping blade and it's like reficul fences to create a really tall rabbit but not that deep the blade is protruding past the fence about a sixteenth of an inch maybe a little more than that shelves we going to mount to the wall on a French cleat so rip the cleats of a scrap with my blade tip to 30 degrees so since i'm going to mounting this on the wall with a French cleat this one I get glued into the shelf and this one will go on to the wall and they'll lock together like that now to make this happen i first need to create a recess in the back of the shelf so i can mount the shelf cleat into it and then you won't see any any of this clade system when the shelf is actually on the wall so I've laid out the basically this giant mortise here it's going to be stopped about an inch and a half from both ends it's going to go down the thickness of the French cleat which is a three-quarters of an inch and it's about maybe an inch and a quarter wide yeah so I mentioned a quarter wide and I'd love to go 316 from the top and the bottom now notice as I'm using my router here i'm using my reference face that i made off the joint ER so now it's straight and square to this one here then we're actually working on and as you'll see since this isn't a consistent thickness the remainder on the bottom is actually going to be variable compared to the top and I was kind of clean this up a little bit with the chisel this is not going to be seen but I figure might as well make it look a little better than his little hump to in the middle there now there's a little better and then I can glue the cleat into the shelf clamps then the last thing I'll do is just break these edges with the block plane and then to get to the inside of slip here I'll use some sandpaper ok I'm finished I'm gonna give it one coat of this really light shellac I don't want a really thick film finish on this just looking to kind of you know seal things up make it look a little nicer and kind of bring out that rough sawn look the finish will also helps seal in and either remain dirt and grime and stuff that will be left on here so I'm really happy with the way the shelves turned out overall it took me about an hour to make and that includes filming so it's a really quick project and really quick to hang as well so that's great and more importantly my wife really likes them and she's happy that I finally made these because I've been saying that I would do this for a long time if you like to see more of my simple projects I have a bunch of them listed in this playlist here check those out and if you want to see something a little more complicated check out one of my build videos perhaps this small dresser that I'm standing next to and as always thank you for watching really appreciate it if you have any questions or comments both these shelves or anything else I've done in the past please feel free to leave me a comment as always I appreciate those and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have until next time happy we're working ",

        "content": "I went to Home Depot where I bought a pre laminated 12 by 4 ply sheet and a 10 foot one inch galvanized steel pipe both of these cost me $40 my son wanted a corner desk but he is limited by a window on one of the walls he wants the desk in I drew out a quick draft that will ensure I clear the window this has plantation shutters and extends four inches when perfectly open the desk will be two feet from the wall and five feet six inches in length once you know what shape you want simply draw out your table on the surface of the board I am positive the pipe can hold a larger desk but I think that two feet is the perfect size for a corner desk instead of a corner I am going to make a slight arch to give it a more professional look I simply measure out a foot on both sides and with a nail placed at the point of the intersection I draw out my arch I drilled a small hole at the end of my ruler so my pencil tip can fit through it with a compass I round out my corners anything will work a paint can will do just fine you just want the bends to be long and round so when you apply the edging it will have no problems adhering to it once your desk is drawn out you may begin cutting first I clamp down a straight board as a guide to keep my cuts straight you will have time to prove you can cut a straight line when you get to the bends for pre laminated boards you need to use a very thin and fine finishing blade to minimize the chipping at the particle board beneath the laminate to really cut down on chipping you can use a straight blade and cut along your line if you do this then when you are sawing do not cut on the line but to the outside of it finish the rest of your cuts in the same manner until the desktop is completely cut out now to cut your pipes simply use whatever metal blade you possess and cut your pipes I have decided that I want the death slightly higher than two feet so each pipe was cut to three feet six inches this will include the bend dividing the length of your pipes in half clearly mark them so you can ensure your bends will all be centered take your pipes to a workshop or if you have a pipe bender bend your pieces to 90 degrees each I have a piece that will take multiple bends to avoid the window I anticipate you will not have this problem if you are making the bends yourself ensure they are 90 degrees by using a square this is the double Bend piece that I will be using to avoid the window now lay your pipe on a flat surface and drill out the holes these holes will be used to secure the desktop to the pipes you probably won't need more than three a hand drill works fine but here I will be using my drill press to ensure that the holes are ninety degrees just ensure you are using a titanium drill bit where this process will take a long time taking a piece of scrap that was cut from the desktop I clamp it down to ensure that when the pipes are drilled the holes remain perpendicular to the wall just make sure you clamp the pipe to the scrap piece so it's straight up and down once all the pipes are bent and drilled you can paint them I had some leftover glossy white from another project so I use that use whatever is closest to the wall color of the room the desk is going in the desk edging is actually sold as shelfing edging it is three dollars a roll and one roll will easily cover the desk and some using scotch tape I taped the edging into position I cover the iron with aluminum foil so I do not get any adhesive on the iron or burn the edges while applying take your time and melt the edging onto your desk in past experiences I have learned that screws are easily pulled from particle boards so I've decided to cut a couple of braces that I can tack down and with wood glue mount to the bottom of the desk this will be stronger and allow me to screw in the mounts with regular screws your only limitations to the width of these boards is to ensure that they are wider than your pipe but not small enough to allow tacks to penetrate through the top of your desk top take a small scrap piece cut from the desktop and test your nail depth before you fasten the real ones to the desktop the worst thing you could do is penetrate the desktop with a nail on the last step of this project simply use a level when installing your pipes to the wall you can set them at any height you desire a good rule of thumb is to ensure that the armrests of your desk chair can easily pass under the desk now place the desktop on the pipe mounts and slide snugly into place the last step will be to secure the desk top to the pipe mounts with a bead of glue lace one side of your cut board tack on with a nail gun and allow an hour or so to dry before screwing the pipes to the bracket once again check the length of your screws to ensure they will not penetrate all the way through both the pipe and the other board if you know where all the objects on your desktop will be placed the last part is easy use a hole saw to cut your hole to run your wires place this hole in an inconspicuous location and that's all there is to it now you have a nice looking modern floating corner desk that gives you ample space above as well as below thanks for watching ",

        "content": "hey I'm Bob and I like to make stuff today I'm going to show you how to make a really simple floating desk first I made the frame and it had to fit between three walls I did this with just regular old two by fours I cut down two long pieces for the front and back three pieces to act as cross braces I pre drilled some holes in the ends of the long ones and countersunk them so that the screws could fit flush add drove in screws and just made a simple box the last piece of the frame was just to fit in the center piece and screw it in the exact same way to make the actual surface of the desk I figured out how many pieces of 1x4 I would need and then I just cut those in half on the chop saw to make sure that I had enough I laid them out and then rearrange the grain pattern to what I thought would look good these were going to be connected with biscuits using a biscuit joiner so I had to make a mark between two pieces anywhere that I wanted to biscuit to sit on these marks on each piece I use the biscuit joiner to cut a slot and I had to do this on both sides of most of the pieces other than the front in the back once I got all the slots cut which was a whole lot I added some glue to the surfaces and down in the slots that were cut then I just pushed a biscuit down into each one of the slots some of them were tighter than other because the biscuits are often a little bit different in size so some of them had to be knocked in with a mallet some one end very easily then it was a matter of just lining up the slots between the two pieces using the lines that I've drawn earlier I clamped these two pieces together alternating the clamps from the top and the bottom this helps the board's not to buckle in one direction if they have even pressure at first I just started with two boards at a time I wasn't entirely positive that my long clamps would be long enough to do the whole tabletop at once on each of the rest of the boards I added the slots to both sides of it then I added glue to all the surfaces and down in the slots before dropping in the biscuits I had to glue to the top of these biscuits so when they went in their mating slot there would be glue on all the different surfaces it took a little bit to line all these up but once I got everything lined up I used some really long clamps to clamp the whole thing together again I use clamps on the top and the bottom to make sure that there was even pressure and this would stay as flat as possible the last step before I did the final glue up was to clamp on that two board section that I had done previously it turned out my clamps were plenty long enough and like I always say you can never have too many clamps today's video sponsored by dove men plus care and their personal care brand but there's a very specific reason that I wanted to work with them I spend a lot of time in the shop without air conditioning and I spent a lot of time outside running training for marathons between all of that and living in the deep south I'm sweaty a lot of the time and being sweaty a lot at least for me causes a lot of armpit irritation and chafing they've done a whole bunch of research and I found that over 50% of men deal with some sort of an armpit irritation if we don't have to deal with that stuff we're going to be more comfortable more confident we're just going to do a better job at whatever it is we're doing I know for me if I'm comfortable I will work longer and train harder for sure so they made a whole line of ana purse prints made specifically to fight irritation and if you deal with this at all you want to visit the link below and you can see all their research and the line of products they have to help you be more comfortable so be sure to go check them out thanks dove men plus care after that panel was dry and out of the clamps I had to clean off the glue squeeze-out it comes up in droplets so I just used a scraper and slid it along the lines all those droplets popped off pretty easily a biscuit joiner does a pretty good job of lining up the surfaces but it's not perfect because the biscuits are a little bit different size so to smooth it out I used a hand plane and just ran over all the joints until I couldn't feel them very much it didn't need to be perfectly smooth and this wasn't something I had a lot of experience with I got it pretty far and then finished up with an orbital sander the last real step of construction was to add the front pin it needed to be deep enough to cover the 2x4 frame and the 1 by 4 top so I used a 1 by 6 and just stripped off just a little bit I set it up against the front of the top panel and added biscuits just like I had done to create the top panel itself i clamped a piece into the vise and added the biscuit slots from the backside then it was a matter of just attaching it like I had done previously glue biscuits knocking it together with a mallet and adding clamps but I wanted this piece to be a little bit stronger just because it wasn't in to end I used some clamps to pull this piece snug to the tabletop and make sure it lined up well I split the width of the desk into 6 equal parts and then made a mark 3/8 of an inch down from the top this is right in the middle of the board that's behind it I counter cycle hole and drove in a screw and this really forces those pieces together then I added a dowel with some glue into that hole and sawed it off so it was flush originally I wanted this desk top to be removable so you would lift it up using the front panel that's why it needed to be attached in a really strong sturdy way well turn out in the end that wasn't going to work out but I went ahead and did this because I like the detail of having those dowel ends from the front panel i planed down that edge just to get it smooth with the top again and then ran over it quickly with the sander but it didn't need very much the sander was really handy to get those dowels completely flush on the front panel the glue and the sawdust around those holes fills in any gaps which is really nice then I needed to trim it to the correct width I used my speed square and clamped on a straight edge so that I could get a nice even cut along one side of this table I had to do the same for the front face but there wasn't enough room for the circular saw so I used the flush cut saw instead after getting one side completely flush I measured over the actual distance that I needed and cut off the opposite side the client wanted the desk to be a classic gray stain so it covered the whole thing with a really thick coat and then went back and wiped it off with some paper towels I left it on for probably about five minutes before I started wiping things off after that was dry I did two coats of satin polycrylic with a light sanding in between I wanted the tabletop to be very smooth I laid the frame over a piece of eighth inch plywood and cut it to size and this is going to be the bottom once it's I measured up the height where I wanted the frame to stop and then used a laser level to mark that point on all three of the walls that this would be attached to I went around on that laser and made several marks because I would cover up the laser while I was in there installing it I dropped some screws into each one of the two by fours into where I knew studs were then into the corners I filled in the rest of the spaces with some anchoring screws that I had that I knew worked pretty well I wanted to test it out and it's plenty strong then I just sat on the top I had to do some adjusting and slamming and knocking in but once I got it fit in then I drove some screws in through the two by fours into the frame of the front I ran at a time to stain the bottom panel before I put it in so I'm gonna have to go back and stain that later this was a little bit different that I had stalled that desk but then I had to actually do some last-minute travel you can tell I'm actually on the road right now and I wasn't able to get back in there to get the final shots of the desk so all I have to show you is a photograph but this is what it ended up looking with I was really happy with how it turned out and it was a super simple build I did mention before that the top of this desk was originally supposed to be removable that was the idea and I was going to put some magnets in the bottom of the top piece and in the 2x4 frame so it would stick together unless you actively pulled it out I was hoping I could add some hidden storage to it that way just to make it a little bit more interesting and when I was installing it I found a problem the opening that the desk went into was actually a little bit larger on the back than it was on the front so to make it fit I had to trim off a little bit of the front to make it nice and snug but that made it so I couldn't actually pull the desk out I was running out of time and didn't have any other options at that point so I just made it fixed which is what they wanted in the first place so it's a super simple project something you can add to any little look in your house very easily you can add some storage underneath it you can do a lot of different things to customize it to fit whatever space you have to put it in I hope you like this one if you did I'd love to hear about let me know down in the comments or my website I like to make Steph calm I've got all my social links down there and lots of other videos and stuff for you to check out thanks for watching guys see you next time [Music]

        "content": "okay so here's the tools I'll be using to install these shoving units onto my wall you don't need two drills but you do need a drill with a hammer function and my jaw does have a hammer function but then also want to drill that I can lower the torque so I have a drill and a hammer drill have some tapcon anchors which I like to use in masonry or concrete a tape measure a pencil to mark the walls a small level in a larger level so this level is probably like 9 inches or so and then my other level is about three feet so that's the tools now let's do the first time start by making my marks so this is my wall up here and what I want to do is get it up against the corner over here so what I want to do is I want 15 inches of space up here so I'm a measure 15 inches down and that's going to be the top of my shelf 15 inches from the ceiling and then I'm just going to make a level line across that mark once I get my level going okay so now I know where my shelf is long ago my total measurement is 43 inches so basically you divide that by two and you're going to get your center so 43 divided by 2 is going to be 21 and 1/2 that's my center ok so now from the instructions I need to measure 5/8 7 inch down from where I want the top of the shelf so I can know where to mount my hardware and I'll just make a level crosshair with my Center and that is where my heart where will be mounted so this is the hardware I just want to take it and line it up with that crosshair I just need so this is the center right here and my crosshair is right there in that center hole so I'm gonna make sure it's level because I want to make a bunch a couple of marks okay now it's level traced it out and then I'm gonna turns out a couple more so now I got five points where I'm going to touch now I attach the bit to my drill that comes with the tapcon concrete anchors and I'm sorry making some holes make sure it's on a hammer and now that's what I want to do is fairly simple use the one at ease my drill with the screwdriver bit start attaching this to the wall see it's not tight so this piece of furniture comes with these little washer types that you're going to put on the screw before you attach it to the wall so basically that's what it looks like okay so now they're level I'm going to take my little one out and attach one of the washers to it and put it back in and basically it has these three holes down on to three and you want those facing down now you use these guys and this little allen key they supply you with so now you see I have all three of those in now it's just a matter of tightening them all down so that's the first part now the second part you paying this a little bit that open space right there I'm going to put another a bookshelf type map ",

        "content": "hey guys thanks for joining us today today we're going to give you a glimpse inside of how we make a miser closet that's right why the modular so if you grow with your kids so come with us let's see how we got it done so what exactly is a French creat a lot of you already know but the case you don't it's a 45 degree angle joint that has a super strong hold I start off by ripping 3/4 inch plywood down to some strips here I'm going to use these to make the cubby holes that are going to be modular units that are going to be attached to the wall with that French cleat system instead of chopping these up on the miter saw I'm enlisting use of this panel cutting sled six pieces in total here I'm installing a sacrificial fence up against the fence on my table saw this way when I run this eight inch plywood through it doesn't bind up underneath it giving me a nice accurate cut these are going to be used for the backs of the cubbyhole cutting them here on the panel cutting sled as well the size of the cubbyholes are going to be cut at a slight angle here three inches from one side and three inches from the other cut them at the bandsaw binding them together with some quick clamps and take a belt sander to it make its quick work of getting those edges nice and flush finished up the sanding with a 120 grit with my random orbit sander now we're good to go and that leaves me with bottom sides front and back onto a little assembly here I'm going to go ahead and use one quarter inch Brad's 18 gauge this process goes really quickly all the pieces are ready to go already pre-cut little glue Brad's again now don't worry about this piece be only 1/8 of an inch in the back reason being that French cleat well that's going to give it some more rigidity on the backhand side since this is going to be installed in my kid's room I'm going to go ahead and break all the edges making sure there's no sharp edges on that plywood [Music] and now it's time to cup of wheat I cut these in five minutes section tilt the blade to 45 degrees man I'll tell you what if you guys don't have one of these digital angle calibration widgets if you will they are spot-on love this tool that if I measured correctly both of these pieces should be the exact same size it looks pretty good here I take a quick measurement on where to cross cut knees use the crosscut sled check it again one more time and now we're good to go giving these pieces a little sanding because again I don't want any sharp edges due to the fact is going in my kid's room not only am i installing the French cleat on the top but I'm also installing a 3/4 piece on the bottom that way the cleat has something to rest up against the wall that way then cave-in glue and Brad's are all you need for this except I'm going to reinforce the joint at the top with glue and screws as well these are 1 in 5/8 inch screws going in just like this right into that plywood on the edge and there we go just like that 6 cubbies made in one afternoon ok so make them cubbies but now I got to make something where the clothes can hang so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make three units that are going to be modular still again with that free clean and they're going to be able to hang clothes up check this out six sides three tops and we cut them like this three inches from the top three inches from the side make that angle cut right there on the bandsaw again and then we're good to go guys same process as before we start with 40 grit sandpaper working our way to 120 grit bind those things up together that way you can flush up those edges real nice and clean I actually had some closet rods lying around from the last project but it's not too expensive at the Home Center I go ahead to take a pipe cutter instead of a hacksaw I found this is much easier to get this thing cut looks like it does a great job this onto the drill press I go ahead and set up a series of stop blocks once I get a hanger involved see where I need to drill this hole this hole is the same diameter as the closet rod but it's only drilled about halfway through the material now it's time to transfer that hole to the other side where the closet rod is going to rest what I do is I take a nice pic and I jam it through giving me a reference hole on the backside then I take the smallest tool but I find and I drilled it right through giving me a pilot hole to start where I know that claws are all going to match up on the other side perfectly unfortunately my battery happened to die while I was filming this part I don't have any footage of it but you get the gist all right go ahead hammer those two pieces in place and line them up on the top it looks like it's lined up pretty well a little fine tuning clamp it down here we go glue and Brad's is all you need [Music] I use the more that 1/8 inch plywood to go ahead and mark my line take it over to the chop saw make my cut and install these back with a little glue and Brad [Music] and now it's time to install the cleats on these pieces as well these units of course are going to be modular too and you will see just exactly how this is going to work in just a second and here we are the next morning I think this is a pretty good start six cubbies and three different hanging modules good to go now I take the first event and recess about a quarter of an inch in where these cabinet screws are going to go that are going to install these into the studs into the closet I install three cabinet screws per cleat two on each side in one right in the middle again resetting that hole because you don't want your cubby to have a protrusion where it won't mount correctly first test run wasn't success now I do that same process over and over again until I have installed five different cleats to cabinet screws on the edges one in the middle and this system is not going anywhere [Music] well this is kind of what I envisioned to begin with nine different unit six cubbies three hanging units and here's how we put them in now there is a variety of ways you can do this as you see here you can incorporate hanging down low cubbies up high laundry baskets whatever choice is yours and here we go final product that we're going to go with my boys putting away the rest of the clothes good job up well we are very happy with how this turned out again this is mozilla this is designed to grow with your children when they get taller they can move this stuff around the sister he needs better I know he likes it I like it too thank you guys so much for watching hey guys thanks for joining us for this one this was an absolute blast to build why is the module you asked well this kid probably is going to be six foot ten right you're gonna be that tall no I hope not anyway he's going to be telling me one day and I'm about 6-1 6-2 you know depending on what could be in store I walk out us but check it out y'all if you liked it give me that thumbs up down below I'd invite you to subscribe as well there's going to be a few other videos over here that YouTube is going to maybe think you want to watch I don't know thanks again for watching guys I really appreciate it he likes and she is so excited about the soup thanks for watching y'all take care [Music] ",

        "content": "hey there welcome to DIY projects with Pete today we're going to build some floating shelves let's get started the first step is to frame out the shelf support we'll start by ripping a 2x4 down to two and a half inches wide on the table saw and if you'd like a thinner shelf you can rip the board even narrower or use a standard two by two next use a miter saw or a circular saw to cut the length for each board cut the ledger board to the approximate width of the shelf and then the shorter boards which will be the depth of the shelf I cut the shorter boards to eight and a half inches which will make the final overall shelf dimensions roughly 33 inches wide by 11 inches deep then lay out the five boards that are part of the shelf support we'll attach each shorter board to the ledger using two 3-inch long screws and some wood glue use clamps to help hold the boards in place if needed then pre-drill and put the screws in through the back of the ledger into the shorter board use a square to ensure everything is lined up correctly and once the two outer boards are attached evenly spaced the two inside boards or spaced them as needed to make it easiest to mount to your wall attach the inside boards using the same method or if you prefer use pocket holes simply drill each pocket hole using a jig and then attach with glue and two and a half inch screws then do a quick sanding to remove rough edges and to smooth things out next we'll build the box that will slide onto the shelf support I used cedar fence pickets to keep costs down and because I like the gray weather finish you can get with the steel wool and vinegar stain but feel free to use any type of wood you like because I use pickets I needed to use two boards on the top and bottom to be able to have a deeper shelf the measurements I used can be found in the free plans at DIY Pete comm forward slash floating shelves cut the length of each board down to size next put the boards in place to simulate how the Shelf will look I like to use the frame support to hold everything in place during assembly and then butter up the ends of the boards with wood glue and attach the sides using an 8 move onto the other side and repeat the process use clamps if needed to hold boards together during assembly then pull out the shelf support and attach the front piece of the shelf box with wood glue and nails sand the entire shelf box using a sander and 220 grit sandpaper this is going to give the board's a smooth finish and it's also going to remove excess dried glue next go ahead and add a finish for the shelf I patina the wood to give it a gray weathered look using a steel wool and a vinegar solution and if you'd like to do the same you can check out the video tutorial on how to make it by clicking on the link in the description below feel free to stain or paint the Shelf to best fit your space and simply brush on the solution let it react with the tannins in the wood and dry for at least an hour then seal the wood I used a water-based spray sealer that dries clear and keeps the wood the gray color and here's a look at how the wood darkens to a brown color when sealed using an oil-based stain allow the sealer to dry and then get ready to mount your new shelves to the wall use a stud finder to determine where you'll attach the shelf support the studs are typically 16 inches on center use drywall anchors if needed for your particular situation then pre-drill through the wood and attach to the wall using 3-inch long wood screws I used 2 for each stud and the shelf support was rock-solid then grab the shelf and simply push it into place it should have a nice snug fit I installed one additional shelf below and here's an up close shot of how the box slides over the shelf support you can see it's pretty slick how it slides into place and you can use a few screws to secure the box to the shelf support from the top if needed and that's all there is to it load up the shelves and enjoy the free plans can be downloaded at DIY P comm forward slash floating shelves thanks so much for watching please subscribe and give this video a thumbs up if you found it helpful and Cheers from Montana and for free DIY inspiration and updates on the latest projects make sure to head over to the website to join the email list it only takes a minute cheers guys ",

        "content": "hi I'm Matt and I'm Jackie and we're the husband-and-wife team that make up the DIY village we're here today on behalf of homes.com to bring you a tutorial on how to build your own custom built-in bookshelves today we're working in my craft room we're going to be using the space around the window that is often wasted between the wall and the window casing we're going to be going from the floor to the ceiling so that we can get the most out of this space going vertical is probably the best way you can go so that you can get lots of storage plus built in is going to give us a really upgraded professional look in the house and going to return some value in what we spend on the materials too so now we're going to be making the base for the bookshelf we're using 1 by 3 stock we've cut them down to the measurements based on the area we're working in and we're going to put these together using the Kreg jig jr. and that's a product that allows you to easily join pieces of wood together make really really strong joints to give you a little idea how it works these gray areas here are sliders they have measurements on each side and those measurements are correspond with the width of the wood you're working with so these boards are 3/4 inch thick and what we'll do is we'll slide these over to where they are on the 3/4 inch marks that leaves a little bit of a lip right there so that as we are ready to drill the pocket holes will put the jig in place by pushing it flush up against the end of the wood and we'll take this clamp and we'll go ahead and clamp them in place and then Jackie is going to drill the pocket hole we'll clamp off check out the dust and we have pocket holes very very strong joints that will flip it to the opposite side and we'll do the exact same thing the way this is going to work is when we have all the pocket holes drill will take longer pieces here and will join them together with the shorter pieces using screws that are made for pocket holes the inside pieces will clamp in place and then screw them in okay we're ready to start building the bookcase it's a very simple process we're going to be using our 1 by 12 we've already cut them length to length and we've cut the top to length but what you're looking at here are two sides and the top we're going to connect these using the same system we used for the base the Kreg jig Junior we're going to get pocket holes in the side pieces and those screws will attach through the side piece into the top piece pulling this joint tight we'll do the same thing on this side about halfway down we're going to cut a shelf that will be a fixed shelf we're going to measure it to fit inside between the the two sides and in the pocket holes will actually be drilled on the sides of the fixed shelf and go into the sides here of these then we'll do the bottom piece exactly the same way we did this one like I said a very simple process so we'll go ahead and get that going and we'll move on to getting the adjustable shelf side okay so we've gone ahead and we've attached the side to the bottom and top and we've added a fixed shelf in the center what we're going to do now is we're going to make the pin holes for the adjustable shelves we're going to use the Kreg shelf pin jig we've got two of them and makes it really easy to use so what we're going to do is we're going to measure up we've measured about halfway from the bottom to where the edge of the Shelf pin jig meets we've clamped it in place and now we're going place the other one here we're going to clamp it in place as well and now Jackie's going to go ahead and using the bit that comes with the Shelf pin jig she's going to go ahead and drill the holes for the adjustable shelving nice thing about using the Shelf pin jig instead of using something like pegboard is the Shelf pin jig has a steel collar in the inside and so your drill bits not going to walk you're going to get a pretty precise drill bit hole for your shelter now we're we're all done with the construction of the frame of the bookcase we need to prep a few things in the craft room before we can actually do a drive fit we need to remove the baseboard in the area that we're going to put in the the platform base so I'm going to use an oscillating cutting tool to do that it's got a shaking blade it's kind of loud so definitely what I have hearing protection on and eye protection to so we're going to go ahead and do that one thing to keep in mind when you're removing the baseboards is you will have to come back in and use a utility knife and where it's been cocked in place before you'll need to score that area all right now we've got the baseboard out of the way we can go ahead and take our platform base and put it in place now I'm going to take the bookcase and we're going to dry fit it to make sure that we don't need to make any adjustments all right that's not bad it's pretty tight you might have to cut off a little bit more base over here just to get that flush up against the wall while I'm doing that though I might go ahead mark what I need to mark and have Jacquie go ahead and start painting well as you might be able to see we've done a few things to add some bulk to the bookcase we went ahead and installed it in place and secured it against a stud over here in this wall definitely want to make sure it's secure in place we have a little one running around and we definitely do not want this falling anywhere we've also added some one by two trim here on the sides and also on this fixed shelf here we added the adjustable shelves here and one on the bottom and the nice thing about how many chef's pin holes we drilled when we were outside is we have the flexibility of adding a couple more shelves we definitely have more room here and on the bottom four shelves if we want to add any more in the future so up here you can see we've added the crown molding to the top that kind of adds a built-in look about it and then down here at the bottom we matched the the base molding that was already existing in the room and we continued it around the bookcase so it has a true built in feel one nice thing that Jackie did when it came to decorating this is she combined organization and storage with the core so she took some of the stuff she might normally not have out showcasing and put sort of on display on the bookcase but she also has all the stores she needs for all her materials on behalf of homes comm thanks for joining us be sure to subscribe to homes comm youtube channel and be on the

        "content": "okay so the brothers coming along pretty well you can see behind me here I've got my my hot water tank and and pump hooked up for the in-floor heating got my ski rack and the canoes hung and what I really want to focus on today is that there are these shelves that I put up along the ceiling here suspended shelf system that I came up with really cheap and easy way to do it you know to go online on Amazon or to go to Home Depot and you know buy a section of shelving from here to here like four feet you're looking at like 200 dollars and I figured out a way to do this for I don't know that probably that section right there probably cost me like five bucks maybe you know a little bit of time and effort but you know I think it's worth it now that it's done and it's I've got my spare tire summer tires and everything up there so it can hold quite a bit of weight so yeah I'll take a second and show you how I how I did this so basically all you'll need for this project is some three-eighths inch plywood some two by twos or two by fours that that you that you rip I've just taken this 2x4 this ripped it and has some three inch screws maybe one and three-quarter inch screws using an 8 screws four for the shelves and and that should that should be about that all you need if you're going to use 3/8 inch plywood make sure you cut your strips along the totally and don't do them across the board because they're not it's not as strong that way so make sure you cut them sort of up and down that way okay so basically the first thing I did was I cut two two inch strips full eight feet in length and those are the bottom strips for the shell after cutting those I then cut a four inch wide strip in the four inch wide strip is the upright support for the shelf this is basically what keeps the shelf from falling falling to the floor once those strips are cut the four inch strips I cut to the height of the shelf plus two inches for the before the scrips at the bottom in my case it was 34 inches now the shelf with itself I cut with a full sheet of 3/8 inch plywood in this case I do the shelf with was 26 inches using my skill saw which I felt easier to do than using my table saw I just cut the machine to the appropriate width as far as building the shelf goes so you've got your two two inch strips that are eight feet long and then your appropriative sized four inch strips first four inch strip you're going to put it half on half off the two inch strip going to move over to the four feet or the middle of your of your run on the two inch strip put your your next up right there take a square and make sure that it's that everything is square on and then your second two inch strip simply just goes over top of it like that now the pattern of the screws is important don't just drive screws three screws across like this it's not going to be as strong drive two screws one here one here flip the whole assembly over and then put your next screw here and here that'll make it very very strong you might be wondering why is this this board half on half off so when you get to your next shelf as you can see right here the upright strip the next lower piece two inch strip going across meeting on that same upright all right now that assembly is built you're going to want to mount it to the wall what I did was into a level line so that I have the back support perfectly level and then took my square and through the depth of the Shelf off the upper wall using the back support which is just as simply a two by two that screwed directly into each one of the joists make sure you screwed into the joists otherwise it won't stay up same thing on the ceiling screw it into each one of the rafters I just used number a three inch screws if you want to make it stronger you can use lag bolts okay so then using the assembly we just put together line it up with the previous shelf clamp it into place and then screw I appropriately the uprights what I used was a square of three-eighths inch plywood that I cut from from the four inch strip and I screwed into that into the plywood and any into the two by two making it really strong now you also have to notch out where the uprights meet the bottom support in order for the shelf to simply just drop into place as it does here you can see where I've knocked it around the upright support then using one and a half inch screws you can screw into the back bunch supports to secure the shelf support is ready for the next shelf to come on the end there it is I'm going to take a section of the 2x2 and where the two sheets of plywood meet in the middle I'm just going to put that as a support the bottom of the shelf right here up at the top of the support there cut you know scraps of plywood and screw that in instead of screwing like directly into into the plywood so one of the questions you might ask speaking of speaking of that is why not just build this at a two by fours well I mean one it's this is this is a little bit cheaper and two plywood is actually really good in tension it has a really good tensile strength two by fours do as well but when you screw into a 2x4 especially up at the ends like that you run the risk of splitting the 2x4 whereas with plywood because of its it's biaxial you don't have that don't have that issue if you wanted to make the system even stronger use some lag screws same thing with the screws down here and then to make this shelf stiffer you just make these pieces the the bottom strips there you make them thicker and and that'll make the shelf weight bearing a lot a lot higher and you can see like I got a lot of storage up there and I don't know if I have enough stuff to fill it all up with so I'm gonna continue on with this and get it all the way around the garage so that's pretty straightforward a um if you want to see some other videos that I've done some other how-to videos follow me on Twitter I'm at the how to dad check out my youtube channel and and you can see some of the other stuff that I've done some skiing videos some funny videos with one of me any smoked by a wave and Hawaii check them out follow me on Twitter and I'll keep you updated on what's going on ",

Iowa so what's the first step let's start off I did this earlier what I did was measure out what I had they came in long pieces I decided the biggest piece how much I could cut it in half and I got five feet so I cut them in half in 25 feet and the size doesn't really matter figure out how much would you have and how best to optimize it so I got 25 foot pieces that way I marked it to sort of trim off that little broken edge and that's where the color change and then once I got that I got a third piece and I basically split it down the center so it was 10 inches wide so i got 25 foot pieces and so that's going to be the wraparound for the front and the back so if you look here this is what I got and you can play in here so what you want and then I actually have a second piece which I didn't have enough to show you guys at home but treat this no this is the actual finish it's a gorgeous right pay a lot for that kind of finish so once you've got this laid out you've got your two sides your front and your top and your bottom what you're going to do is assemble it and I actually used a nail gun to do this so you can take a look here first use wood glue because you really want to make sure you get an extra hold with a lot of these old pieces their warped and not necessarily consistent so the wood glue adds an extra bond and then I used a nail gun but you can also get use tiny finishing nails and tack it in so you know that's super easy put on your two sides put on your front and just go around and really this could be as wide or as narrow as you want it and the very end you know put on that front facing piece which is going to finish off the the block that's what I've got right here and once while we were at that table exactly thing together now we just got to put it over here on the wall excuse me Christina you want to drill for us sure no don't do that so what I've got up here is a ledger and all this is the two-by-four that it's nailed to the wall you can use dry anchors you can use Molly bolts talk to your talk to your hardware store they can actually give you recommendations as the best way to hang it because really depending on whether you have sheetrock or whatever walls and then all you're gonna do is three nails through the top of it into that you screw screw sorry for you would like mine is from Ken you can visit can win guard i can win guard dot-com this is fabulous that would put everything on there alright well a nice job ",

        "content": "hi I'm Susan from living Rajon less calm and if you've been following our closet makeover you know that we're building a custom closet on a tight budget and today we're going to show you how to build your own shelves and make them fit snugly without any gaps so in order to save time on this video we've gone ahead and what we've done is installed 5/8 inch furring strips and basically I got them for 89 cents per foot at my local lumber warehouse and I went ahead and primed and painted them white and then where we could find studs in the walls we went ahead and drilled holes pre-drilled and attached these furring strips to the walls and these furring strips will be the will hold our shelf and I liked using furring strips they're they're more sturdy than your brackets and they're also less obtrusive than your triangular brackets that you see now after we installed these furring strips here to hold the shelf it's time to actually cut the shelf to fit and this is the tricky part and we actually have a tip for you on how to do this so I'm going to bring my dad back in our master carpenter and he's gonna he's going to explain the concept of scribing okay Susan what we've done here we selected the piece you want to make for your shelf you want to cut it to fit this is a piece of normal Rock run-of-the-mill particle board with a melamine covering on it that we bought down at Lowe's or wherever and we're going to scribe this to v as well now I've added some blue painters tape on this edge for a couple of reasons we can mark that tape and put the tape on it keeps the chipping and the spoiling whenever you make the cut to a minimum and it lets your saver so right on the tape instead of scratching the surface so the way you do the scribe is you have to get this in there where you can get to it and what I do is turn the piece up when it's this way set it in the closet on an angle now this piece is two inches bigger than the hole that we're fitting it in so put it on an angle this way we're going to scribe this side push it back tight against the back wall and then if you don't have one you need to get a common set of scribes carpenters call it subscribe some people call it a compass for drawing several but you want one that has a little locking wing that it locks the the adjustment on it pretty snug now we know this is two inches too big so I'm going to set these for one inch approximately one inch down here from point to point we're going to make a mark on this board that rides this wall that changes transfers the profile of this wall out of square to this board and it's done this way we've set this compass for one inch approximately one inch width because the piece is two inches too big for the holes we want to take half that distance off one inch so because we have to cut the other side in like manner later and we'll show you that after bet now what we do is take this compass set it for one inch or approximately and let it ride the back this this wall the pin side of your compass rides the wall and the pencil makes the mark on your piece on your tape and you just pull that towards you and let the compass ride the wall clear out and then it is transferred a mark unto this board coinciding with the profile of this one okay so now what some people don't cut the tape on the board as I said to minimize the small and the scratch from the saw some folks like to take a regular single knife like this and on your pencil mark you have in here kind of scratch or scratch that with the shingle knife and that little bit of a scouring helps to keep from this melamine surface from spoiling to some degree and keep it to a minimum now we're going to use a saber saw because if your wall has the profile you're gonna have to move that saw little bit to transfer that angle when it cutter that or to ride that curve of that at mark so this is a time for the safety glasses as we all know follow that mark that you put on there from one cut this side okay Susan that we made the first cut on our shelf on that side we put the tape on the board on this side what we're going to do is now we've got to get the exact dimension of the back of this closet I use an extension ruler with an inside reading devices you see here go to dr. words close to 31 inches this is a 32 inch closet and then and slide this ruler out till it's the exact dimension inside your closet take your ruler out of there and read that dimension and what we have is 31 32 33 33 and 3/8 inches then I transfer 33 3 inches onto my piece down here from the edge we cut at the back to this side which is 33 and 3/8 inches and I come up with a mark on here that's the mark we will set our scribe to when we spread your left side okay Susan now we reversed everything we've done on the right side now the Shelf is tilted into the left side of the closet we want to transfer the profile this wall onto this side and we've measured on our shelf board the 33 and 3/8 down here and put a mark on this board we're going to set our compass from the wall up to that mark which is right there and then we ride this wall pulling your compass in place transferring that mark onto your tape and that should be a mark on your board of the exact dimension of your board okay so we finished the second cut here on the left-hand side that we scribe and as you can see we've brought the finished shelf upstairs and we fit it perfectly on top of the furring strips it fits snugly no gap on either side and it perfectly rides the wall we have a nice finished shelf here stay tuned for more on this $200.00 closet redo next we're going to be putting another closet rod up another shelf and we'll be adding shelves on this side ",

        "original_title": "Build Simple Floating Shelves",
        "content": "what's going on buddy I'm Johnny Brook welcome back into the crafting workshop video in today's video I'm going to be showing you how to build these simple DIY floating shelves so I built these out of some fancier hardwoods I used bubinga on this bottom shelf and soft maple on the top shelf but if you don't have the machinery required to mill rough lumber you could build this out of something like a 2 by 8 from your local home center and build these with nothing but a circular saw to cut the board's the length a drill to cut the holes in the back for the floating shelf hardware as well as cut the holes for the dowels and in the doweling jig itself which is only about 20 bucks so this is a great beginners woodworking project and if you build that of a 2 by 8 you can paint it or stain it to match the look to your hero 4 so let's go ahead and get started with the build so as I said in the intro if you don't have access to the tools required to mill rough lumber you can either buy s4s lumber from your local lumber dealer which means it's already surfaced on all sides or you could use something like a 2 by 8 from your local home center so the first step since I was using rough lumber was squaring up the wood using my jointer planer and table saw so I started by joining one edge on the jointer then cut the shelf pieces to rough linked on the miter saw so the dimensions of the shelf pieces are 18 inches long by 6 inches wide for the top and bottom pieces and 5 and a half inches long by 6 inches wide for the side pieces so I left the two side pieces of the shelves as 1 11 inch piece since they would have been too short to pass through my planer otherwise so next I flatten one face and one edge on the jointer and this gives me a reference surface for the next steps in squaring up the boards so with one face flat I could put that base downwards on the planer and bring the opposing face parallel and this is one of my favorite parts of woodworking it's almost like unwrapping the piece of wood since you really don't know what's below the rough surface until this point and this was my first time working with bubinga and it is just absolutely gorgeous so I also brought all the boards down to roughly an inch and 1/8 thick while at the planer next I squared up the other edge of the boards on the table saw also ripping the boards to their final width of six inches and finally I cut the boards to their final length at the miter saw squaring up one end before cutting the other end to length so what the boards cut to size I could start laying out the joinery for this build I used the Rockler half inch dowel drilling jig kit and so the first step was to mark lines where I wanted to put my dowels and placement here wasn't super critical since the shelves won't be supporting a ton of weight mostly just knick knacks and that kind of thing and half inch dowels will provide a ton of strength next I set the depth on the drill bit that's included with the kit since I definitely didn't want to drill through the face of the shelves and with the depth set I started drilling my dowel holes so one key when using these jigs is to make sure to clamp the jig tightly so that it doesn't move and I didn't clamp the jig tightly enough when drilling a few of these holes and this caused my shelf pieces to be slightly misaligned a little later on so with the top and bottom boards done I moved on to drilling holes in the sides so first I reset my depths again using a dowel for reference and the process was basically the same as the top and bottom boards except on the sides I was drilling into the ends of the board and once again just make sure to clamp the jig down tightly so it doesn't move so once all the holes were drilled it was time for assembly I added glue to the half inch dowels and then pounded them into the corresponding holes and make sure not to add too much glue since it'll create too much pressure for the dowel to seat fully and you can see that I had some trouble with this when I went to put the shelf together since I had added a bunch of glue to the dowel holes but luckily a little clamping pressure got rid of the gaps so while I assembled the maple shelf let's talk about one of the sponsors of this week's video Rockler so I used a ton of rock lip products during this build including their dowel drilling jig blind shelf supports and their ever trusting glue brush and I'll have links to all the items I used in the video description below so Rockler has got tons of great tools and accessories for your next build and they're always coming up with new and innovative ideas to help make your woodworking more efficient and more enjoyable so thanks again to Rockler for sponsoring this build after the glue dried I cleaned up any mints and linemen and the shelves with a hand playing off camera and since hopefully you won't run into this problem and then added a chamfer to all the edges with a router so this is obviously an optional step but it really gives the shelves a nice look also having my wagon bites on my new workbench makes workholding during routing a breeze man I love that thing so after routing I squared up the inside corners with a chisel since the router leaves a rounded edge there next I laid out the hole locations for the blind shelf supports and these supports need to be mounted to studs so I space the hole 16 inches on center and I also centered the holes along the thickness of the shelves and then used a center punch to mark the location so to drill the holes I used my drill press which is highly recommended if you have access to one but if not just make sure to use a square or a drilling guide to keep the hole as square as possible next I saying that both shelves up to 180 grit making sure to remove any burn marks from the router and also hand sanded all the chambers to really smooth them out for finish I used water locks another one of this week's sponsors and water locks is a blend of tung oil and resins and creates a really tough water resistant finish that is also absolutely beautiful the tung oil penetrates into the wood while the resins remain elastic and this combination holds up to we're extremely well to learn more about water locks check out the link in the video description below and in total I applied three coats of water locks letting the finish dry for 24 hours between coats and finally it was time to hang the shelves so I used a stud finder to mark the locations of my studs and then I mounted one of the blind shelf supports to the stud using two and a half inch screws so to mark the location of the other shelf support I put the shelf post itself into the hole in the back of the shelf with the set screw that's included with the shelf hardware installed then I leveled the Shelf and then put pressure on the Shelf to mark the exact location on the wall so I installed the other shelf support and then did a test fit of the Shelf and it looks great so with the first shelf done I could mark the location for the top shelf I made sure my marks were plumbed to the first shelf using a level so the shelves would line up and I spaced the upper shelf 10 inches above the lower shelf so they were arranged in a square so I solved the shelf hardware for the upper shelf the same way I did for the lower shelf and with both shelves in place the project was done man did I say shelf enough times there alright hopefully you guys enjoyed this one this is a nice simple project but I'm really happy with the look I actually got inspired to build these from my local eye doctor believe it or not they had a whole wall full of shelves that look like this and so I'm hoping to kind of expand this shelving over time this is great if you have like one single board of a certain type of wood that you couldn't really build a whole project out of this really doesn't require a ton of wood and the result is beautiful so if you guys enjoyed this one go ahead and get subscribed I put out new project videos like this every week also I have a list of all the materials and tools I use down in the description below also a big shout-out to all my supporters over on patreon of a list of my $10 patrons here on the screen you guys want to join up I'll also have a link to patreon alright guys thanks again for watching and until next time happy

        "content": "okay this week I'm going to be working in this corner I'm not a huge fan of this corner thing and both me my husband have been wanting a bookcase or bookshelves somewhere around the house but I don't have too many other places to put it other than here so looking at this corner I think that I want to make some floating shelves corner shelves some corner shelves floating shelves some corner floating shelves that will hold books let's get going I'll be making all of my shelves from 2x4 and quarter-inch plywood and I do have a free plan available on my website the first thing I did was take all the two by fours and cut them to the width needed at the table saw then I set up a stop block at the miter saw and cut all of my pieces to length next I repeated the process using the quarter inch plywood this will be used to make up the top and bottoms of the shelves after cutting them to width then I moved over to the miter saw and set up a stop block and cut them to length now to actually start making the inside of the shelves I grabbed the two by fours and used a countersink bit first before joining them together now I make sure to put the cut edge of the 2x4 pieces always facing the outside edge that way that it'll either butt up against the wall or be the exposed edge later on also I used a spacer to just make installing these inside pieces easier then I would grab one of the quarter inch plywood surfaces and attach it using my nailer now for the time being I only attached one surface so that I wouldn't have a tight spot for my drill whenever installing these I was mostly done building the shelves when I decided to make the two bottom shelves a little bit deeper and I didn't have enough quarters material to cut two new surfaces so I ended up just using a patch piece to make sure that all of the ends were as flush as possible I grabbed my belt sander and attached it to my workbench which is a really awesome feature by the way and then just grab each shelf individually and ran each side over the sandpaper to make sure that it was nice and smooth then I laid out all of the shelves and used joint compound to fill in any of the imperfections or those patched lines that I created and while that compound was drawing I decided to go ahead and make some molding this is really exciting for me because it's my first time really getting to use my router table I made the molding from some scrap two-by-fours that I had and I was just so pleased with the results I made two or three passes to get the profile completely cut in I found out with this bit I was able to get two profiles cut on one side of a 2x4 after getting all four cut in I took it over to the table saw and resold it in half then I laid it down flat and cut it in half to get the four separate pieces next size I apply two coats of paint to the shelves and while that was dry and cut all the different molding pieces to the links needed using a miter on all of the ends then spent a little bit of time cleaning them up with a chisel and sandpaper then I also gave them a few coats of paint as well when I came to actually installing the shows I cut a few spacers to make life easier and I would first set the shelf in place making sure it was level to pre-drill the location of the studs and also mark where I was going to need a drywall anchor then I was able to set the Shelf back into place and attach it permanently with the screws with the long shelf attached I came back and repeated the steps with the shorter shelf using a clamp to help hold it in place when it came time to attach those front surfaces again I used a countersink bit first and I just repeated the same exact steps for all of the other shelves so you can see they do I mean these things are sturdy they're going to be perfect for holding books I can't be more queasy after they were all installed I went through and nailed on all the bottoms then it was time to - the molding and that's when I found a mistake so big mistakes silly mistake whenever I was making this molding the height of it I did not take into consideration the bottom that I was gonna be adding so now this molding is under flush I went ahead and installed the pieces and what I'll do is come back later and make a kind of filling moulding part that will fill up that gap I came through and just attach these with the brad nailer now since my walls are a little bit curved I did come through on the back ends and apply a line of caulking then with everything dry it was just a matter of applying one last coat of touch-up paint yeah I didn't realize how big this corner was with that small little corner milk in here I think that these shells just really open it up and I can't believe we're pleased with the way that it looks I mean it's definitely give us a lot more function to this corner but aesthetically I'm just way more in love with this look but I'm really happy with how sturdy they are as well those wall anchors are no joke it was a very simple project I did mess up the molding but other than that it went really smooth so if you would like to go in your own I do have a very simple set of plans for these shelves on my website of walk reduce calm so check that out and that's it for this one um I will see you the next time I'm working on something guys I'll have to climb into the attic to get the rest of our books real quick I want to say a big thank you to lynda.com for sponsoring this video and supporting what I do now if you don't know lynda.com is a website that has online video tutorials available for one flat monthly fee they have a ton of topics that range from education to animation to music to design and all classes are taught by professionals that are passionate about teaching so the information that you're getting is not only clearly given but it's also very accurate if there's something that you've been wanting to learn let's just say designing a website then you can go to London comm and take an entire course on that subject and it'll walk you through from the very beginning all the way to the very end and what I really like is there's an index given to you to where if you already know about a subject you can very easily skip to the next chapter and of course with it being online you can learn at your own pace it's a pretty cool website that I've been able to get plenty of use out of so again if you would like a free 7-day trial then go to lynda.com slash April ",

        "content": "[Music] welcome to Bella work design with me propelling they look at how to make these floating does first a look Alex floating shelf work alright so this is the actual structure of the floating shelf it allows the cell to float on the wall in the air these are two backwards i sat down to make a frame for the shelf these are than anger does one two three four anchors into the wall so when you choose do this project make sure you first build a frame for yourself and then angle itself into the wall and I can be angered either into the two-by-fours orb i'm using wall hangers that are strong enough to support anything that you might put on the shelf alright once you have your frame in place for your shelf your shelf should essentially let's over the Frank so if you look at the inside of our shelf we actually have a big space on the inside and this isn't to allow for framing build on the wall to fly it inside and allow the shelf the flow so now let's take our shelf or an Espada on our frame and we will fish look how our plugin shell [Music] alright so this one we have our floating shelf install on the wall now ready to fight anything on hop through life have all right so here's that frame I was just showing you in the beginning of the video and for this this is tough room two by fours that I cut down to the interior sides of the shelf and these are being glued and screwed together and I did use a kreg jig to cut the slots for these so I thought that given X drinks and blue and the screws there to make sure that shelf would be held securely to the frame here alright so the next step was to cut the actual pieces for the shelves this is all custom a premium pine you can buy at Lowe's or Home Depot these are all the exterior parts of the shelves which really you're just building a Casey to go around that frame message that being the decorative part of the shelf doesn't want to see so for the top and bottom and the sides I did glue and brad nail the shelf together the only part did not Brad nail together with the actual front the face of the shelf I knew it would be seeing the most were these shelves would be placed and I didn't want to have any mail whole graph to worry about covering up nail holes or worried about fill in the man or with the stillers to leave it spot from brad nail any of that I want to just the board there on that but the top of the bottom I knew probably wouldn't get seen as much they're just accept sitting on top those most likely to cover up into those holes i wants to fill up some bread knee over the bread maker itself [Music] so here I am gluing in healing that together and you can see right now the internet boxers hollow one thing you want to do is make sure you cut some kind of pieces i would say either two or three pieces to sort the inside of your shelf keeping top from sagging and the bob from sagging as well so there was pieces I said I did cut to pieces from the inside and then Brad nail those from the top in from the bottom to keep the whole shell from shifting and keep it square shape so this is the actual face of the shelf the floating shelf will be seen most and I was very generous with the glue here I glued everything up and then I'm clamped it up and loves to dry overnight I wanted to make sure that you had time to cure on there or did it kind of standing or anything else that would apply any kind of force to that so be sure this is the same tactic that you use make sure when you clamp it up do you have a plenty of time for what your glue you're using the cure completely on there now undiscussed one detail potential in this video you can see there's lots of grain on this wood here and so I wanted to match the look there was a table that was can be sitting below these shelves and a lot of deep train in the wood so what I did was take a drywall through it anywhere you can see that would rain that darker color showing through I traced all those grain lines with the wood screw to make some people kind of curves out inside the wood and then in my finishing step I went back and I did three whacks and the free wax with atty color free waxing so that wax wasn't able to get inside of those grooves and really highlighted those grooves as I made with the drywall screw and I also did some wormholes around there comes the drywall screw too I just kind of give it some extra texture extra look to match this table that it was going to be going to be sitting the shelves on the wall mounted above this table [Music] so once the glue had time to draw next morning I did sand everything down i standed all the edges so everything was rounded over or I didn't route it but I want to have a more natural look to the sander and make sure all the edges are flush it look like one solid piece of wood all the way around I'll finish here so this is the medium walnut teak oil I put that down first is to help seal the wood and protect the wood and then after that i did use wax but part of the reason i did both of these was i was trying to match the same on the table to these shelves are mounted above and this is the way i got it so I did the medium walnut cheap medium walnuts and danish oil sizes danish oil NT coil that danish oil and then after that i went back over debris wax with eat eat free wax so between those two things and that was allowed me to match the staining of the table below and give it a great look so do make sure if you use wax like this it was polish the wagon at the very end so definitely this worked out well and was able to match those the tables and they look great up on the wall all right now we have our completed shelf is Lee Rizzio with you have a lower shelf never shelf here this is a project where they make ball spell built all shell the exact same wood so thank you guys very much for watching if you did like this video please give the video a thumbs up in the bottom you could leave me any questions or comments below and i would love to respond to this be sure to check me on patreon and lawfully the link to that below and that's a chance for you to support me if you like saying doing the videos I'm putting out the projects I'm putting on you guys so until next time be inspired keep learning keep building [Music] ",

        "original_title": "Build Simple Floating Shelves",
        "content": "welcome to DIY crafts com how to make a secret compartment floating shelf available on DIY easy crafts com you can download free plans you will have to purchase cabinet hinges these are full overlay cabinet hinges available at home depot or any other hardware store there are basically two assemblies to this floating shelf the wall assembly and the hinged front assembly we're working on the wall assembly first and bottom of that unit attaches to the back just with wood glue and some screws the sides also attach in the same manner with wood glue and screws but please be sure to insert these sides about an eighth of an inch in from the absolute end of that wall unit the reason for this is that when the hinged front is sliding over it you don't want it to have to rub in those signs and you could even put those in a half inches the only reason for the sides is to give support to the top which will be screwed on at a later time alright we're now moving on to the front hinged assembly and this is basically just three pieces of wood the front and two sides again they are assembled with wood glue and screws and once this is assembled you'll see that that the front folding assembly is actually slightly longer than the wall assembly so it just slides right into place we're just going to lay the top in place right now it's actually easier to work on this unit without the top screwed in place and that's how the front folds away now I tried to do this with a couple of different 2 inches piano hinges with standard hinges there's just no way of doing it without an exposed portion of the hinge which would give away the secret compartment so really the best thing to do is to use the cabinet hinges as as explained earlier you will have to purchase a tool that can be inserted into any drill it's just a small router and it comes with its own Jake for Logan to them you just mark the location from the edge of the wood and then that you router a whole basically just the death of the rabbit and the hinge just it's inserted into that once the hole is aboard the hinges just screw into place with small screws which are included the size of this floating shelf can be varied you can make it longer you could make it a little bit shorter this one's about 24 inches long you do want to be able to grab two studs so the minimum that you'd want to make it width wise would probably be in the 18 inch range but you could certainly make it longer we're going to encase the entire outside with molding and in this case I've taken small molding and I'm going to attach it with wood glue and some finishing nails to the very top edge of the box I'm then going to cut some additional strips of pine to fill in the void on the bottom but first I'll put all the molding along the top this is the the side molding which I've kind when us when attaching this molding be sure that you don't drive finishing nails all the way through because you basically just mean the hinged front assembly to the inner box and you prevent it from opening you can use finishing nails at the very end where it's going through the edge of the pine or you can hammer a finishing nail you know about halfway through just attack it into position while that wood glue dries very important before you attach the bottom piece of pine to cover the bottom of the box you have to break the edge on the very front bottom edge of the wall assembly the reason for that is when you attach that final piece of pine it would actually bind preventing that front assembly from folding outward and you can do this with a file you could do it with a sander using a disc sander any way that you want to break that edge and this is the piece of pine I just cut it to the right height cut 45s in both sides and I'll attach that also with wood glue and a couple of finishing nails again i'm going to use those finishing nails just on the ends I'm not going to nail through the you know through the front folding assembly and we're almost done this is the ends or the sides of the finish pine which will finish the molding and then once we paint sand and paint this unit and fill in all the little creases with some corking it will look as if it's just solid molding encasing the entire box and again the finishing nails not all the way I learned that the hard way and the floating shelf is basically almost done we're just going to attach the top which in this case is a half inch piece of plywood finished on one side a little bit of wood glue and some finishing nails is it very easy to make project and there are a downloadable PDF plans and a complete cut sheet available on WWD I why easy crafts com we're going to attach this unit to the wall with some large flat-head actually torque head screws I like these they're available at home depot or any other hardware store there about four and a half inches long and they're very very much again each of these floating shelves should be attached to a minimum of two studs and the finished product the neat thing about it is you can leave whatever's on that upper shelf in place they can access whatever it is that you want to hide please check us out on the web at DIY easy crafts com be sure to check out our other how-to videos and please subscribe to this YouTube channel you ",

        "content": "Hey guys, Again Mr ATC and welcome back to MyATCtv!!! Today we are going to create a nice DIY floating shelf for the bathroom and for less than 15 euros\u2026 For this project, I have been invited to work on a new bathroom design in Paris and the goal was adding a simple DIY floating shelf in this corner as you can see just right here which is measuring  23 cm large\u2026 The owner of this apartment couldn\u2019t find the right furniture for this spot so ask me to design it... And as you already know as soon when it\u2019s about making, I am all IN!!! That\u2019s the reason why, I\u2019ve decided to share this project with you in case you find yourself experiencing the same problem at home\u2026 Alright!!!! So enough talking let\u2019s make it happen!!! To make this shelf you don\u2019t really require a lot of tools, here I am making it with 2 pieces of lumber from 1 meter long, 20 cm large and 1.9 cm thick Here Each of the 3 shelves will be cut at 20 cm large and 21 cm long in order to be inserted into the main back piece I gonna  start by cutting the different shelves pieces first and note that for this I am using a minor saw but you could also use a handsaw or jigsaw depending of what you have available. To insert the different shelves, i am here taking some marks in order to cut using my router and making a deep cut at 0.7cm\u2026 then I decided to place the shelves to have a first testing look and also trace a line giving me their exact thickness to follow with my router Yeah, looks like I like it already\u2026 Alright time to use the router! Here if you decide to use a router, remember to be very precise in order to cut just on the line. Here to make sure the shelves are staying in place and with an angle of 90 degrees I decided to drill some holes in order to insert screws from the back (so when looking in front of the shelves, they should be invisible) and keeping this all creation strong and stable Then I am sanding a little bit to avoid having any side particles while trying to slide the 3 shelves to the holes\u2026 For the finish, I\u2019ve decided to use some invisible lacquer to keep the real wood texture and spirit as I really liked it.. Even if the color in the bathroom was mainly gray, i thought that adding a wood spirit with this DIY shelf could create a very nice additional design And here we are with a cool DIY bathroom shelf. Guys as usual, remember that you will be able to find below in the video description links a free plan to this creation if you want to make it yourself And don\u2019t forget to share with us your own creations via the ATC App, you will have a link showing up just above this video Feel free to check it out!!! I really hope that you liked this project, and as usual, Mr ATC for another idea of housing!!!! See you next time and don\u2019t forget to share, subscribe and comment below the video\u2026 Bye\u2026. ",

        "original_title": "Build Simple Floating Shelves",
        "content": "today I'm going to build a few shelves from my daughter's pottery and the design for the shelving is inspired by the artist Donald Judd who is a minimalist sculptor and I made this small model to get an example of what one of the sculptures kind of looks like you'd have to imagine this bigger and these cubes made in a different material they were often made in aluminum and plexiglass I'll start by making four boxes the top and the bottom of the boxes will be made out of half-inch birch plywood the tops of the bottoms are on the same measurement so I've set up a stop block and that way I only need to measure once I've got the tops and the bottoms of the box cut and now ready to move on to the walls and that's this part right here and for that I'm using 3/4 inch birch plywood and these are just some odds and ends that have been hanging around the shop it's a good way to use them up and also the 3/4 inch birch plywood will be more stable than using solid wood I've got all of my parts cut and I'm ready to start assembling the boxes I'm going to attach the front to the sides first and then I'll attach the bottoms and the tops I'll use a little wood glue and inch and 3/4 nails in the nail gun and now to attach the tops and the bottoms and just make sure you're flush with the front as you work your way around the box it's always a good idea to use a damp rag to remove any excess glue before it has a chance to set up I finished making all the boxes and the next step is to band the edges to hide the end grain and the plywood up and the two sides in the front now I'm painting the boxes so MDF will work fine but if you wanted to you could also make these boxes out of cherry or I think they look good in walnut just make them out of walnut plywood then band the edges with walnut or you could even laminate a veneer on the boxes even though I know the walls of the box are 2 inches and I've used half inch plywood on the top and the bottom it's still a good idea to take a measurement because sometimes happens plywood can be a little bit light this looks pretty good though so I'll rip the edge banding at 3 inches you Motz new day I've got a few coats of paint on all the boxes and now getting ready to install them I'll install the shelving by the Kachin cleats to the wall and then the shelving will fit over the cleats now I make these cleats out of 3/4 inch birch plywood simply laminating two pieces of plywood together I made them a little bit heavy and then I trim them on the table saw so it's just a nice snug fit in the back of the box the way I like to install a shelving system like this is to first install the bottom cleat now I've only got a stud in the center here so I've pre-drilled encounter some two holes in the cleat and these two screws will catch the stud and at the ends here I'll put a dab of glue and I'll put a screw in to these holes it's only going to hit sheetrock but between the glue and the two screws in the stud that should be more than enough to support shelving this small I've attached a cleat with one screw and made sure that the cleat is level and now I'm ready for the second screw I'm using 3-inch cabinet screws to attach the cleats to make the installation a little easier I've ripped a piece of quarter-inch plywood to 13 inches and this way I'll have the same spacing between each shelf and since the bottom cleat is level all I need to do is attach the second cleat at the line I'm attaching the shelving to the cleats with inch-and-a-quarter drywall screws and I took a minute to spray-paint the screws first and that just looks a little bit nicer Hey well I had a lot of fun with this project and if you think you want to make these shelves I'll put this cut list up on my website just search Donald Judd inspired shelving system now if you have any questions I'm going to answer them and I'm gonna start doing the follow-up video I guess maybe on Wednesdays Tuesday's on Wednesdays and so if you have any questions just leave them in the comments please subscribe also I'm going to start doing a lot more with Facebook so if you've made a project a lot of people have made the projects that I've made here in the shop I'm going to start posting them up on my Facebook and some of the paintings that people make in my painting class now as far as inspiration I like to talk about different artists because I think it's really good to look at a lot of different art and furniture design sculptures because you really never know where your inspiration is going to come from and what I decided to do a video on this project I took a look around on the web and I found a pretty cool interview hour piece that 60 minutes did on Marfa Texas now Donald Judd had bought an abandoned military base in Marfa and that's where most of his sculptures are housed today and it's become kind of a mecca for art and artsy type people and so on one hand you have these ranches that have been around forever and now you have all these kind of artsy people and it's created this sort of nice little coexisting community that it actually looks like a fun place to go visit but if you want to know more about that I'll put a link to the 60 minutes piece in the description of this video thanks for tuning in and I'll see you soon thanks dad one two three go ",

        "content": "This bathroom is ready to go. We've already had the trade's man in and they've\ndone the electrics and the plumbing. I want to put something of my own in here,\nso I'm going to build a beautiful hardwood floating vanity. It's going to be a real centerpiece for the\nbathroom. Here all the tools materials I'm going to\nneed to make my floating vanity. The first thing we're going to do is join\nour two pieces of timber together. I want to make sure I get the nicest faces\nup right. Now stands your timber boards up, glue the\nedges, lay them back down and clamp them together. As we don't want to damage our timber, we're\njust going to use some chalks in between the clamp and the timber. To ensure that the boards don't bark in the\nmiddle when clamping, we're going to put two additional clamps on top. We're now going to remove all the glue from\nthis side of the board using a chisel and a rag. We use a chisel as this avoids spreading the\nglue around. To get these two boards level and remove the\nstep, we're going to put one block off cut timber underneath, the other on top. And we're going to hammer them level. Now, the timbers all level, we just need to\nclean off the excess glue and then leave it to dry. Make sure you follow the drying times in the\nback of the glue you've used. Now it's fully dried. I've taken off the clamps and we need to remove\nany excess glue that has oozed down, and then flip it and do the other side as well. We're going to sand back our timber. We're going to be using a belt sander here\nas it will give us a nice smooth finish, and we want to make sure we have a nice level\nfinish as well. It's looking great, so we'll send it back. We need to make two of these, so we can repeat\nexactly the same process for a second board. You should now have two of these pieces of\ntimber. They've all been sanded back. You're not going to pick out the best piece\nfor your top, and you need to mark that and the frontage. The next thing we're going to do is cut the\n45 degree miter at one end and then we're going to measure back to give us the length\nof our vanity top. Now we've got our top done and miter it out\nthe way, we're going to follow a similar process on this second board. The three pieces were going to get are the\nside panels, the basin and then the miter. Now we need to join the pieces together and\nmiter them. Before doing this is a really good idea to\nmark those pieces are going to join together, so you don't get confused later on. I've now rebated all my mitered corners for\nmy brackets to fit into. We now need to glue and nail them together. When you apply the glue to your corners, you\njust want to make sure you get a really good coating. We're going to continue on mailing and gluing\nour mitered corners making sure that they're flushed. This is already starting to take shape. Let's glue and pin this final piece in. Now we just need to put some brackets in to\nprovide some additional strength. We're going to drill and screw them in, really\nsimple. We now need to measure the top of our vanity\nunit and cut it to length. To preserve the natural look of the wood,\nI'm going to give it a clear stain. This will go and looking kind of milky but\nit will dry clear. You can do what you want, but I think that\nthe clear stain here will really make the wood look good. To fit our vanity, we're going to bring it\nup and make sure the holes are in line with our rear bar. It is quite heavy so you will need an extra\nset of hands. Once the vanity is back up and in place, you\ncan just put some glue along the back of the rear bar. There you have it, completed floating vanity\nunit. [Inaudible 0:03:48] vanity which would cost\na fortune in the shops, we've done it in a fraction of the price, plus it's something\nwe've made ourselves. The timber brings a beautiful natural elegance\nto the room, and a simple design is understated but really stylish. I absolutely love it. ",

        "content": "hey youtube sam here i'm making some shelves for my daughter's room forgetting a piano when my grandma's old piano we're actually getting that for her and from my sister and we're putting that in her room anyhow and in the process of that we got to move some stuff around she had a shelf that she has a snow globe collection and that's gotta move so I'm building a shelf that can go up on her wall to hold her snow globes this is a shelf that I actually me and my wife have a shot gun shot gun shot glass collection in our room and I built this years and years ago it's basically just a two by two cheap cheapest straightest two by twos I could find and in our shot glass for a shot glass collection we found some actual molding like you put around your room just the baseboard molding type stuff it was actually like three inches but it was super cheap so I went ahead and bought that and we have it actually going all the way around our room my daughter's room were just doing it on one wall and anyway and then for her shelving unit part it needed to be at least five inches so I actually found a board that was five inches by I don't know how long bits but you can use whatever you want as far as the shelving part as long as you need then fairly thin shelves this will hold up great and we've had it in our room for years several several years anyhow so you get some two by two straight as you can and I need a certain length you guys are going to obviously need your own length but i'm going to show you a way to kind of measure something out you know it's one of those little saves you a little bit of time makes a little bit easier don't have to do the math kind of thing and i will set you up for that alright so this is what i did i took one board here put the board side by side on my table here and on this board then i'm going to use the whole thing out i put the tape measure on the end of that and then strung it next to this board all the way out till they meet then I need 118 118 and a half actually I think I need 119 and a half ought to figure that out before I do this imagine replace got once yet again anyway I'll figure that out but what I did was just kind of went from nano one out to the other and i'll show you what i do after that so it was 118 and a half so i got that measured out here then what I'll do is at the end of this board where I need a little bit longer I'm just going to put the mark there then I know where to cut my board out but it up against here and I have the length that I need just a little bit of a trick there that makes a little easier don't have to do math don't have to do quite as much measurements but works well i'm going to make our cut here this idle line because I want this whole piece here using my miter saw my barbecue table I got a video about that if you're interested we'll check it out another harbor freight not the delta sign up late not a pretty good leg cuts pretty good too all right let me show you a little trick on something you might know my not we'll see i'm going to drill out this board I'm screwing in just so we don't split things when I get it inside to screw it into the wall but something to find a center point some of you may or may not know this but will hopefully show somebody who doesn't she bring this down and give it a little bit of Mark there bring it down give it a little mark there I already did this so I'm dead center and it's hitting the same spot but if you were if you had a mark here and a mark here split the difference kind of thing so that way you know your Center if you're splitting if you're going one way bring it down hit a mark and other way smack on the same mark you know your Center just a little tip and trick there well I probably should measure this out and get them all right but as long as they're centered on okay i'm planning on putting the way more screws than I need in this thing just to make sure we don't lose any snow globes and I'm sure I'll find several studs if not I'll drill an extra roll to finest I got to go through do the long one there but I don't figure you're going to want to watch all that and I need to cut my 5-inch board down to the same length just like I did the other board and I'm also going to drill well I'll show you that a little bit i'm back at the table here this will kind of give you a little bit idea of what my plan is this is going to be attached to the wall like that this board is going to sit on top and then i'm going to screw in to that board that kind of gives it a not really floating shelf look but kind of a similar type idea it's you can obviously see that it's attached to this board but it's you know doesn't hang out the room doesn't have big giant angles but it holds you know I don't know I'm not going to give you a weight on it but it holds a decent enough weight if you just have like a little collection going around your room and and these are going to go pretty high up on the law I'll show it to you when it's all done something i'm going to do too is I know that's about in the center of that so I'm going to actually put this here and drill holes all the way down the board so that I can screw into those under this and hopefully have a nice little sturdy shelf but this is actually the cutoff piece so I don't want to drilling holes in it and it just gives you an idea you know hold no hard anyhow that's kind of the basic idea and i'll show you when it's all up and ready to roll all right there's the one I built for the video and here's the other two right here in the middle civic nak shelves they're pretty simple easy thing to do it's just basically an L on the wall that they're pretty strong riester d I'm not worried about them shaking so much that things come down or anything like that in fact we've got a couple doors so you know we'll keep an eye on them make sure nothing rattles too far out of whack but as you can see you can put a lot of stuff on them lots of knickknacks and they look pretty alright it again my daughter's going to take all this back down and paint it one of these days because it's just raw wood right now but you know I probably have a grand total of I don't know less than 20 bucks and all this stuff right here I'm pretty positive probably quite a bit less than 20 bucks in ended up getting united by a couple more two by twos for these and I actually made these shelves not sure exactly what they are the top bone is five so these are like maybe six or eight look like about eight inches out and they still hold perfectly fine a real sturdy NRL's I'd go a whole lot bigger than this and I wouldn't put probably real heavy books or anything on it look knickknacks or troll well so this is Sam jack of all Master none it all have a good one ",

        "content": "This bathroom is ready to go. We've already had the trade's man in and they've\ndone the electrics and the plumbing. I want to put something of my own in here,\nso I'm going to build a beautiful hardwood floating vanity. It's going to be a real centerpiece for the\nbathroom. Here all the tools materials I'm going to\nneed to make my floating vanity. The first thing we're going to do is join\nour two pieces of timber together. I want to make sure I get the nicest faces\nup right. Now stands your timber boards up, glue the\nedges, lay them back down and clamp them together. As we don't want to damage our timber, we're\njust going to use some chalks in between the clamp and the timber. To ensure that the boards don't bark in the\nmiddle when clamping, we're going to put two additional clamps on top. We're now going to remove all the glue from\nthis side of the board using a chisel and a rag. We use a chisel as this avoids spreading the\nglue around. To get these two boards level and remove the\nstep, we're going to put one block off cut timber underneath, the other on top. And we're going to hammer them level. Now, the timbers all level, we just need to\nclean off the excess glue and then leave it to dry. Make sure you follow the drying times in the\nback of the glue you've used. Now it's fully dried. I've taken off the clamps and we need to remove\nany excess glue that has oozed down, and then flip it and do the other side as well. We're going to sand back our timber. We're going to be using a belt sander here\nas it will give us a nice smooth finish, and we want to make sure we have a nice level\nfinish as well. It's looking great, so we'll send it back. We need to make two of these, so we can repeat\nexactly the same process for a second board. You should now have two of these pieces of\ntimber. They've all been sanded back. You're not going to pick out the best piece\nfor your top, and you need to mark that and the frontage. The next thing we're going to do is cut the\n45 degree miter at one end and then we're going to measure back to give us the length\nof our vanity top. Now we've got our top done and miter it out\nthe way, we're going to follow a similar process on this second board. The three pieces were going to get are the\nside panels, the basin and then the miter. Now we need to join the pieces together and\nmiter them. Before doing this is a really good idea to\nmark those pieces are going to join together, so you don't get confused later on. I've now rebated all my mitered corners for\nmy brackets to fit into. We now need to glue and nail them together. When you apply the glue to your corners, you\njust want to make sure you get a really good coating. We're going to continue on mailing and gluing\nour mitered corners making sure that they're flushed. This is already starting to take shape. Let's glue and pin this final piece in. Now we just need to put some brackets in to\nprovide some additional strength. We're going to drill and screw them in, really\nsimple. We now need to measure the top of our vanity\nunit and cut it to length. To preserve the natural look of the wood,\nI'm going to give it a clear stain. This will go and looking kind of milky but\nit will dry clear. You can do what you want, but I think that\nthe clear stain here will really make the wood look good. To fit our vanity, we're going to bring it\nup and make sure the holes are in line with our rear bar. It is quite heavy so you will need an extra\nset of hands. Once the vanity is back up and in place, you\ncan just put some glue along the back of the rear bar. There you have it, completed floating vanity\nunit. [Inaudible 0:03:48] vanity which would cost\na fortune in the shops, we've done it in a fraction of the price, plus it's something\nwe've made ourselves. The timber brings a beautiful natural elegance\nto the room, and a simple design is understated but really stylish. I absolutely love it. ",

        "content": "hi I'm Matt and I'm Jackie and we're the husband-and-wife team that make up the DIY village we're here today on behalf of homes.com to bring you a tutorial on how to build your own custom built-in bookshelves today we're working in my craft room we're going to be using the space around the window that is often wasted between the wall and the window casing we're going to be going from the floor to the ceiling so that we can get the most out of this space going vertical is probably the best way you can go so that you can get lots of storage plus built in is going to give us a really upgraded professional look in the house and going to return some value in what we spend on the materials too so now we're going to be making the base for the bookshelf we're using 1 by 3 stock we've cut them down to the measurements based on the area we're working in and we're going to put these together using the Kreg jig jr. and that's a product that allows you to easily join pieces of wood together make really really strong joints to give you a little idea how it works these gray areas here are sliders they have measurements on each side and those measurements are correspond with the width of the wood you're working with so these boards are 3/4 inch thick and what we'll do is we'll slide these over to where they are on the 3/4 inch marks that leaves a little bit of a lip right there so that as we are ready to drill the pocket holes will put the jig in place by pushing it flush up against the end of the wood and we'll take this clamp and we'll go ahead and clamp them in place and then Jackie is going to drill the pocket hole we'll clamp off check out the dust and we have pocket holes very very strong joints that will flip it to the opposite side and we'll do the exact same thing the way this is going to work is when we have all the pocket holes drill will take longer pieces here and will join them together with the shorter pieces using screws that are made for pocket holes the inside pieces will clamp in place and then screw them in okay we're ready to start building the bookcase it's a very simple process we're going to be using our 1 by 12 we've already cut them length to length and we've cut the top to length but what you're looking at here are two sides and the top we're going to connect these using the same system we used for the base the Kreg jig Junior we're going to get pocket holes in the side pieces and those screws will attach through the side piece into the top piece pulling this joint tight we'll do the same thing on this side about halfway down we're going to cut a shelf that will be a fixed shelf we're going to measure it to fit inside between the the two sides and in the pocket holes will actually be drilled on the sides of the fixed shelf and go into the sides here of these then we'll do the bottom piece exactly the same way we did this one like I said a very simple process so we'll go ahead and get that going and we'll move on to getting the adjustable shelf side okay so we've gone ahead and we've attached the side to the bottom and top and we've added a fixed shelf in the center what we're going to do now is we're going to make the pin holes for the adjustable shelves we're going to use the Kreg shelf pin jig we've got two of them and makes it really easy to use so what we're going to do is we're going to measure up we've measured about halfway from the bottom to where the edge of the Shelf pin jig meets we've clamped it in place and now we're going place the other one here we're going to clamp it in place as well and now Jackie's going to go ahead and using the bit that comes with the Shelf pin jig she's going to go ahead and drill the holes for the adjustable shelving nice thing about using the Shelf pin jig instead of using something like pegboard is the Shelf pin jig has a steel collar in the inside and so your drill bits not going to walk you're going to get a pretty precise drill bit hole for your shelter now we're we're all done with the construction of the frame of the bookcase we need to prep a few things in the craft room before we can actually do a drive fit we need to remove the baseboard in the area that we're going to put in the the platform base so I'm going to use an oscillating cutting tool to do that it's got a shaking blade it's kind of loud so definitely what I have hearing protection on and eye protection to so we're going to go ahead and do that one thing to keep in mind when you're removing the baseboards is you will have to come back in and use a utility knife and where it's been cocked in place before you'll need to score that area all right now we've got the baseboard out of the way we can go ahead and take our platform base and put it in place now I'm going to take the bookcase and we're going to dry fit it to make sure that we don't need to make any adjustments all right that's not bad it's pretty tight you might have to cut off a little bit more base over here just to get that flush up against the wall while I'm doing that though I might go ahead mark what I need to mark and have Jacquie go ahead and start painting well as you might be able to see we've done a few things to add some bulk to the bookcase we went ahead and installed it in place and secured it against a stud over here in this wall definitely want to make sure it's secure in place we have a little one running around and we definitely do not want this falling anywhere we've also added some one by two trim here on the sides and also on this fixed shelf here we added the adjustable shelves here and one on the bottom and the nice thing about how many chef's pin holes we drilled when we were outside is we have the flexibility of adding a couple more shelves we definitely have more room here and on the bottom four shelves if we want to add any more in the future so up here you can see we've added the crown molding to the top that kind of adds a built-in look about it and then down here at the bottom we matched the the base molding that was already existing in the room and we continued it around the bookcase so it has a true built in feel one nice thing that Jackie did when it came to decorating this is she combined organization and storage with the core so she took some of the stuff she might normally not have out showcasing and put sort of on display on the bookcase but she also has all the stores she needs for all her materials on behalf of homes comm thanks for joining us be sure to subscribe to homes comm youtube channel and be on the

        "original_title": "Build Simple Floating Shelves",
        "content": "today I'm going to build a few shelves from my daughter's pottery and the design for the shelving is inspired by the artist Donald Judd who is a minimalist sculptor and I made this small model to get an example of what one of the sculptures kind of looks like you'd have to imagine this bigger and these cubes made in a different material they were often made in aluminum and plexiglass I'll start by making four boxes the top and the bottom of the boxes will be made out of half-inch birch plywood the tops of the bottoms are on the same measurement so I've set up a stop block and that way I only need to measure once I've got the tops and the bottoms of the box cut and now ready to move on to the walls and that's this part right here and for that I'm using 3/4 inch birch plywood and these are just some odds and ends that have been hanging around the shop it's a good way to use them up and also the 3/4 inch birch plywood will be more stable than using solid wood I've got all of my parts cut and I'm ready to start assembling the boxes I'm going to attach the front to the sides first and then I'll attach the bottoms and the tops I'll use a little wood glue and inch and 3/4 nails in the nail gun and now to attach the tops and the bottoms and just make sure you're flush with the front as you work your way around the box it's always a good idea to use a damp rag to remove any excess glue before it has a chance to set up I finished making all the boxes and the next step is to band the edges to hide the end grain and the plywood up and the two sides in the front now I'm painting the boxes so MDF will work fine but if you wanted to you could also make these boxes out of cherry or I think they look good in walnut just make them out of walnut plywood then band the edges with walnut or you could even laminate a veneer on the boxes even though I know the walls of the box are 2 inches and I've used half inch plywood on the top and the bottom it's still a good idea to take a measurement because sometimes happens plywood can be a little bit light this looks pretty good though so I'll rip the edge banding at 3 inches you Motz new day I've got a few coats of paint on all the boxes and now getting ready to install them I'll install the shelving by the Kachin cleats to the wall and then the shelving will fit over the cleats now I make these cleats out of 3/4 inch birch plywood simply laminating two pieces of plywood together I made them a little bit heavy and then I trim them on the table saw so it's just a nice snug fit in the back of the box the way I like to install a shelving system like this is to first install the bottom cleat now I've only got a stud in the center here so I've pre-drilled encounter some two holes in the cleat and these two screws will catch the stud and at the ends here I'll put a dab of glue and I'll put a screw in to these holes it's only going to hit sheetrock but between the glue and the two screws in the stud that should be more than enough to support shelving this small I've attached a cleat with one screw and made sure that the cleat is level and now I'm ready for the second screw I'm using 3-inch cabinet screws to attach the cleats to make the installation a little easier I've ripped a piece of quarter-inch plywood to 13 inches and this way I'll have the same spacing between each shelf and since the bottom cleat is level all I need to do is attach the second cleat at the line I'm attaching the shelving to the cleats with inch-and-a-quarter drywall screws and I took a minute to spray-paint the screws first and that just looks a little bit nicer Hey well I had a lot of fun with this project and if you think you want to make these shelves I'll put this cut list up on my website just search Donald Judd inspired shelving system now if you have any questions I'm going to answer them and I'm gonna start doing the follow-up video I guess maybe on Wednesdays Tuesday's on Wednesdays and so if you have any questions just leave them in the comments please subscribe also I'm going to start doing a lot more with Facebook so if you've made a project a lot of people have made the projects that I've made here in the shop I'm going to start posting them up on my Facebook and some of the paintings that people make in my painting class now as far as inspiration I like to talk about different artists because I think it's really good to look at a lot of different art and furniture design sculptures because you really never know where your inspiration is going to come from and what I decided to do a video on this project I took a look around on the web and I found a pretty cool interview hour piece that 60 minutes did on Marfa Texas now Donald Judd had bought an abandoned military base in Marfa and that's where most of his sculptures are housed today and it's become kind of a mecca for art and artsy type people and so on one hand you have these ranches that have been around forever and now you have all these kind of artsy people and it's created this sort of nice little coexisting community that it actually looks like a fun place to go visit but if you want to know more about that I'll put a link to the 60 minutes piece in the description of this video thanks for tuning in and I'll see you soon thanks dad one two three go ",

        "content": "hey everybody's Courtney with friend from gray house studio and today we have a super simple but equally awesome looking project to share with you guys Brent is going to show you how we built these bookshelves for a nursery I'm pretty excited about the bookshelves but I think I'm most excited about reading books like the stinky cheese man so I've still cracked it open but I looks like it promises to be interesting to get started I began by cutting a 1 by 6 board for the shelves to 20 inches long then I cut the same 1 by 6 inch board for the two sides 4 inches long I clamped a board to the fence to make both cuts exactly the same length the mounting plate on the back of the shelf is a 1 by 2 inch board cut 10 inches long this will go in the center of the shelf and it will be covered up by books that's why it's shorter than the whole shelf the last piece to cut is a 1 by 1 inch board that's 20 inches long to match the width of the shelf and that will be the front rail I cut multiple of these at the same time since I built four shelves to assemble each shelf I started by drilling two pilot holes to attach the 1 by 2 inch mounting plate to the back of the shelf I used wood glue and two 1 and 5/8 inch wood screws to attach each mounting plate to attach each sideboard I use 1/2 inch finishing nails and wood glue to attach the front rail I used to scrap one by two to place under the rail to hold it level with the bottom and give me the same spacing on each shelf I attached the rail through the side boards with finishing nails once all the shelves were assembled I used wood filler to fill in the holes on the side and painted the shelves white using a nap roller for a smooth finish before hanging the shelves I've marked on the wall where the wall studs were with painters tape then after centering and leveling each shelf I screwed the Shelf into the wall over the wall studs using 3-inch screws if you found this project interesting and video helpful be sure to click the like button below to let us know you want to see more videos like this subscribe to our YouTube channel so you don't miss more videos like this and leave us a comment in the comment section if you have any questions be sure to check out studio gray house comm for all the details on this project and to find more projects like it ",

        "content": "since doing the renovation of this back entranceway no starting has happened this week though I want to change that what are we doing is building a small corner shelf sort of around this area to match the timbre of the door a couple months ago I did a video where I took the cup out of this board since I worked out it has moved a little bit and the cup has come back slappy so what I'm going to do now is just quickly flatten it a little bit more and then get ready to cut it into the shape of the shelf now what I'm going to do to make the Shelf appear like it's floating is take the top I mean this is the this is what the Shelf is going to look like from the top down and glue that onto this piece here which is going to give you the impression at the shelf is that thick and what I'll do to this piece here is cut the front off and cut two strips one here and one here these two strips we mount it into the wall and this strip will be glued on underneath here so essentially on the underneath of this piece you can ever strip along there along here and along here and now all that's left before testing it to the wall is just sand and finish that's the first coat done I'll do another two and then once that's dried we can attach the Shelf to the wall so that didn't work out as I'd hoped unfortunately one of the brackets has now ended up in two and I can only assume it's because I was drilling through endgrain which just weakened the board too much but it's okay because what I'm going to do is just go and recreate these on some scrap pine that I have hope you guys enjoyed the short break as you can see I've got some pine brackets on the wall and now the Shelf fits perfectly now that the Fuller's hopefully gone off enough I should just be able to work this out and the leaves surface that I can hopefully sand it in paint and that's it we're done the shelter obviously the next step now it's put something onto the shelf but so far I'm pretty happy with how this turned out if you enjoy the top content I encourage you to subscribe and also maybe check out my Facebook page there's a lot of other projects on the go that I only post photos for and you can find them all there another interesting point about this video is that it was entirely shot on an iPhone 5s unfortunately my good lens is in for repairs so I've had to use this the so far I've been pretty impressed for the quality that I'm getting out of it thanks again for watching and I'll talk to you guys soon you ",

        "content": "Hey guys, Again Mr ATC and welcome back to MyATCtv!!! Today we are going to create a nice DIY floating shelf for the bathroom and for less than 15 euros\u2026 For this project, I have been invited to work on a new bathroom design in Paris and the goal was adding a simple DIY floating shelf in this corner as you can see just right here which is measuring  23 cm large\u2026 The owner of this apartment couldn\u2019t find the right furniture for this spot so ask me to design it... And as you already know as soon when it\u2019s about making, I am all IN!!! That\u2019s the reason why, I\u2019ve decided to share this project with you in case you find yourself experiencing the same problem at home\u2026 Alright!!!! So enough talking let\u2019s make it happen!!! To make this shelf you don\u2019t really require a lot of tools, here I am making it with 2 pieces of lumber from 1 meter long, 20 cm large and 1.9 cm thick Here Each of the 3 shelves will be cut at 20 cm large and 21 cm long in order to be inserted into the main back piece I gonna  start by cutting the different shelves pieces first and note that for this I am using a minor saw but you could also use a handsaw or jigsaw depending of what you have available. To insert the different shelves, i am here taking some marks in order to cut using my router and making a deep cut at 0.7cm\u2026 then I decided to place the shelves to have a first testing look and also trace a line giving me their exact thickness to follow with my router Yeah, looks like I like it already\u2026 Alright time to use the router! Here if you decide to use a router, remember to be very precise in order to cut just on the line. Here to make sure the shelves are staying in place and with an angle of 90 degrees I decided to drill some holes in order to insert screws from the back (so when looking in front of the shelves, they should be invisible) and keeping this all creation strong and stable Then I am sanding a little bit to avoid having any side particles while trying to slide the 3 shelves to the holes\u2026 For the finish, I\u2019ve decided to use some invisible lacquer to keep the real wood texture and spirit as I really liked it.. Even if the color in the bathroom was mainly gray, i thought that adding a wood spirit with this DIY shelf could create a very nice additional design And here we are with a cool DIY bathroom shelf. Guys as usual, remember that you will be able to find below in the video description links a free plan to this creation if you want to make it yourself And don\u2019t forget to share with us your own creations via the ATC App, you will have a link showing up just above this video Feel free to check it out!!! I really hope that you liked this project, and as usual, Mr ATC for another idea of housing!!!! See you next time and don\u2019t forget to share, subscribe and comment below the video\u2026 Bye\u2026. ",

        "content": "well I can almost hold it here hey welcome to hack number 29 the closet redo where we turned it into a pantry this was just empty with no shelves in it a while ago and we put all these shelves up and it's now full of food I'm going to show you how it got that way my friend just had a kitchen remodel done and she wants shelves put in this pantry closet there used to be those wire type shelves in there with the brackets and instead of putting the shelves back in like that we're going to do some wood shelves and I'm not going to use brackets I'm going to put what's called a ledger along the wall so you follow along here now we'll show you how to do that very thing first thing we need to do is find the studs in the wall I've got a stud finder you can find these at most hardware stores you just push the button and when you move it over a stud the little red lights lights up and shows you where the end of it is so we just move it along and there is an edge there's the other edge so there's one stud so we'll repeat this for all three walls and locate where the studs are all the studs have been located now it's time to mark a line with a level where the shelves are going to go and we've measured ahead of time between the shelves so I'll get mark here on this one level nice and straight for wine right on the wall well this mark is the bottom of the shelf which will be the top of the ledger strip the ledger strip will be a piece of 2x2 screw to the wall where the studs are we've got the ledgers cut and they need to have holes drilled in them now pilot holes are called that way the screws will go in and anchor into the stud and not have to bind in the ledger on the way through so now I need to drill all these holes ahead of time that's right the ledgers installed she will watch what happens here remember I've already marked these where the studs are pre-drilled the holes so on this first one all I really do is just get it lined up with my line or on the show a short torpedo level here make sure it's good lovely wow I really lucky that's right on the mark that's it repeat that from the top one and then we'll use letters on the side behind put the shelves on the ledger Ledger's are all installed and we're ready to put shelves in to cut these all the way around all the way down five shelves worth left it off from the top one because I think it will just work out okay what it is I can get two shelves out of this eight-foot piece and cutting them at forty seven and seven eighths just to leave a little bit of room that way they're not gonna fit really tight which could maybe cause problems dropping them in because the roots of that closet is 48 inches cut these pieces I have to put shelves in all the boards usually have a crown to them and you want to put the crown up that way when the weights on it it's going to be pushing against that people in a way it's just going to say a little bit over just barely makes it will just put a screw in each corner angry cash there's a lot of cats in my videos no matter where I go cats all right these are looking great all the shelves are in and we're putting some reinforcements in these corners here you see right here on this one where I put a bracket underneath here because this shelf needs a little extra support so put one here too and one more to go check out how those go in just basically joins these two alright there we go let me transform this closet into a pantry again so Lord Allah with food and cookbooks and all kinds of stuff and if you're wondering how strong these are I weight about 165 pounds hang on wonderful book without a problem at all so they're really tough and they look nice because there's no shelf brackets in the way so that's it for this week tack till next time keep on hacking Oh ",

        "content": "[Music] hi guys it's drew and this is my first DIY video we're going to be making a hanging shelf you can see it there let's get started what you're going to need pretty simple you just need two pieces of wood a wood saw textured spray paint black spray paint paint measure ruler pencil paper just write down some measurements yarn hammer and two nails literally that's it's so simple it literally cost me like ten dollars so let's get started alright the first thing you're going to do is get measurements I was just measuring my wall as you can see me there and then I just wrote down stuff on my pencil paper that's why I said you need two different measurements the from literally all in uniform then I walked over to my workspace I just laid out my stuff and set up my camera and got to move the project so let's actually start so that I just got my tape measure and measure down the piece of wood where I was going to do the cut also while you're cutting be very careful it's a sharp thing I feel like an adult saying this but you really need to have an adult like this was a dangerous cult like this saw was like actually really scary and I should not have been using it on this piece of wood to actually get a real saw and actually cut the wood right so I cut mine to 15 inches obviously yours was going to be different because it's your shelf but I did 15 and I you can see me and I'm just struggling there and it's kind of embarrassing but the third time I saw was two days week you can see there it was a scary time it broke the wood and the I think of woods problem and the sauce problem at the same time so like get a real soft don't follow my example that was a very bad saw you can see I'm literally struggling so hard to get this thing off like it was so annoying and I was like trying to break it it was like all my Jesus but yeah when I finally got it I just kind of stopped it for a minute to contemplate my life no but actually for something ah there's the worldcat for the side make sure you close it you don't step on it and kill yourself because literally that was very scary saw and I'm pretty sure your saw will be scary too not that scary though so then after that I got my other piece of wood and measured it cut it and got to painting you're going to want to take your textured spray paint and make sure you shake it like if you don't shake it the texture is not going to like mix well and it's going to look really really bad then evenly going back and forth just go on the wood and get an even texture make sure you cover it fully so you don't really see the wood unless you are going for that like distress the fat I went for a full cover that's and ends up looking distressed samer another piece but um yeah just go over it like that and just yeah cover the entire thing and don't make it ripley like I did I literally was way too close to the void after that chunk dries just get like one of the sides though you like have more than one side drying at the same time after that I just went inside for like two hours check the paint afterwards cousin realized I should have been doing it on not dirt and got a ton of stuff oh okay oh my gosh don't be me actually we get a workspace and then I got those spray paint and sprayed the other side a little annoyed all the clips got deleted of me doing the other piece of wood and the other side of the piece of wood so bear with me just spray them it's not that hard I assure you next take your yarn and measure it around your piece of wood you're going to want to have to perfectly the same groups and make sure that they're perfectly the same like if they're not your shelfs not going to be even and it's not going to look that great I assure you like that make sure you do this twice because there's two shelves next you're going to take your black spray paint and spray the yarn just get like the main coat over and make sure you're working on the surface I finally got one it's just like an old plastic tablecloth so just spray the yarn until it's black the reason I chose to do white yarn the black spray paint if so could have this really nice ombre look so it isn't just straight black it looks like grey and some spots and black and some spots then hang it on something and just spray the parts that didn't get sprayed so it ends up looking like that well you wait for this dry you're going to want to put your nails into your walls you know exactly where your shelves are going to be going so I did one down low like this and waited to do the other one so that I could place it correctly after the other one is up and I saw how it looked then reattach the strings the shelf and then I just hung it up and it was really simple I just made it even now there's this trick on iPhone where if you open the compass app and then just swipe to the right like you would swipe to the next page of apps you actually get this level and it's really awesome it's like interactive and it changes colors to help whenever you're perfect so I just use that and make sure my shelf is perfect as you can see it can hold a lot of weight while I'm putting any other nail into the wall you can see I put my succulent planters my keys and some sunglasses on there and it doesn't seem fazed at all it just holds it and yeah then I got my other shelf and just hung it up above the other one so they're in like a diagonal pattern and it looks really awesome then I got the leveling app on my iPhone and just made sure that the second shelf is perfect as well after I leveled it I just put on a speaker a little faith candle and a bottle of lotion on the shelf and it held so yeah and then you're done that's it for this video thank you for watching please like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video bye ",

        "content": "hi Rosie hi Rosie hey guys and welcome back with my channel today's video is going to be something a little bit different I'm going to be doing kind of a home decor DIY video so a little while back I actually did a video on how I completely redid our like dining room table it was just a classic wood table and I kind of flipped it and made it farmhouse style I painted it in stained it so I thought I would just kind of continue this little series here on my channel as I you know work on my house and fix it up a little bit I'm basically just trying to do everything on a small budget and do a lot of it myself do a lot of DIY project so today's video I'm going to be showing you how I made these really awesome DIY floating shelves they kind of have a rustic farmhouse feel and they were very inexpensive and actually surprisingly really easy to put together so I'm going to show you step-by-step everything I did to create these beautiful shelves you can kind of see a little bit of a sneak peak of one of the shelves behind me I am still working on decorating them but they are just totally transforming in this room which is our main living room and I'm so in love with them so I'm going to show you guys everything that I did the very first thing that we did is we went to Lowe's our local Lowe's and picked up the materials that I needed so first I just picked out four of like the pre-cut like wood plank fours we used pine and they were super easy to find you just go to like the wood section of the store and they have like all different cuts and lengths and widths of just different wood planks four foot planks were perfect for the wall space you're working with so I picked up four of those and then I also grabbed some Elle hooks I believe they're called and that's what we actually used to like fasten the shelves to the wall and then lastly I picked up some black spray-paint which is what I used on the l-looks to turn them from boring ugly metal into like a matte black some of the supplies that I needed for this project I already had at home like one stain and screws and you know things like that so once we got all that stuff we headed home and neck I started working on actually the shells themselves turning them from boy blanks to really gorgeous stained shelves so the very first thing I did was just give each of the wood planks a good sanding and then brush all of the sanding dust off so then it was time to stain the wood if you can see the Roses tale just ignore it considering were you guys doing on the couch right now but I used a stain from mini wax it's actually the same stain I used on my dining room table the top of it and I believe it's in the shade espresso and basically I just painted that on with a paint brush going with the grain I just did one coat because the what I like the way that that color payoff turned out it's kind of a rich deep cool tone brown I really like it so I went ahead and I stayed all four of the shells or the wood planks and then I let that sit overnight and just completely dry and the next day I went back and I actually put like a top coat or a finish on it like a wood finish which is just clear these aren't really going to be touched or handled ever so I probably could have just skip this but I figured I would just put one coat on the directions actually said to put like two to three coats on and let them dry and then sand in between but since no one's ever going to be touching these I just throw in one coat and called it a day not sure if that that we were supposed to do it seems to be okay thus far I am so not Pro when it comes to sup I'm just like totally winging it so who knows the next thing I did was I spray-painted all of the L hooks so they would be like a nice matte black I just took them off my backyard throw down a plastic-like drop cloth and just sprayed them on all sides that was super easy and then the next thing to do was actually install them on the wall so for this part I actually had Matt come and help me because he's a little bit better with this kind of stuff I did help out but he definitely just the rains as far as the installation of my DIY shelves so the first step to actually hang them on the wall was choosing where we were going to put them so we just kind of measured on the wall and figured out where they would fit best you know on the wall space that we had and then we just went ahead and marked those areas for where we kind of wanted the shelves to sit then we went ahead and used a handy stud finder to go ahead and just find like the drywall like the not the drywall but the wood planks and I don't even know what the term for those are but you guys find out what I'm talking about so we use the stud finder to locate these studs and then we would actually hammer the L hooks into those studs so I just put it into the drywall as well and just need to make sure to get those like special hooks like the plastic with the nail inside it's like a two-for-one type screw and those hold a lot of weight and you can just put it directly in the drywall and you don't need a stud but our stud we're conveniently located to where we kind of wanted to put the L books on the wall so it worked out fine so once we figure out where the studs were and do where we were going to be hammering in we went ahead and just made like a small line on the wall where like the bottom of each shelf would go and that way we knew exactly where the L hooks should kind of like land on the wall because the L hook was gonna be holding the bottom of the shelf so once we had that done he actually went ahead and started putting the L hook on the wall and as he was going along he kept using the level over and over just to make sure that everything was obviously level but more so that so that each hook was completely level with each other so we wouldn't have like crooked shelves because that would not be good then once we had our L hooks on the wall we went ahead and just plopped each of these shelves on top and then perfectly measure to make sure that it was even on both sides so it was like perfectly centered on the wall and then I went in with a pencil this is actually something I did I went in with a pencil and marked where we should be screwing these screws into the into the boards like through the L books so on the L hooks there was like a screw that would go into the wall and then there was also a couple of like screw holes to go up into obviously the shelf so that the whole thing is stable so I just went in with a pencil and just kind of marked off where those screw holes were so we knew exactly where to drill which is what we did next so we just took our shelves and drill a hole for each of the screws to go in it was super straightforward and simple and very very easy and then the very last thing to do was just put the shelves back on the wall and screw the wood screws up into the boards through the L hook so that they were secured from the underneath as well so that was it it was actually a very simple process and it was definitely like out of my comfort zone our comfort zone because we're not usually using drills and like getting all fancy like if anything will like hang a picture frame but honestly it was very and both of us were like surprised at how well they turned out that was like these are actually really great this is a good idea it's like thank you they honestly add so much to the room I am so excited to go in and decorate them I do have some stuff on here now but they're all pretty much like MVP Supremes that still need pictures so I am still working on that and I'm slowly working on getting this whole living room together in general and I'm definitely like a few months down the road I would love to do a living room tour of this whole room once it is like completed so if you guys want to see a video like that please let me know because I would love to film that I think it

        "content": "hey I'm Bob and I like to make stuff today we're going to make some inset floating shelves one thing Volusion for sponsoring this video Volusion has an all-in-one ecommerce solution if you want to start an online store they have all the tools you need to do it both they can help you build the site and they have a bunch of educational materials to help you get a business started Volusion is doing a really cool thing right now called stores and stripes it's for active US military spouses and veterans it's a way for you to get a business off the ground for $1 for a year you get an e-commerce store all the support all that stuff you give a $1 donation to Operation Homefront and they'll get you going be sure to check out Volusion thanks for sponsoring this video let's get to the shelves I had some friends who wanted some floating shelves that look like they were made out of a thick beam about two and a half inches I started with 1 by 12 pine for the top and the bottom but you could also use plywood for this for the faces I wanted to use pallet wood since it was going to be kind of a rustic look overall I trimmed off one end and then cut it to length and on the table saw I ran it through just to knock off one rough edge then I ripped down three pieces at two and a half inches to make the face of each one of the shelves to match the thickness of the face I needed to add some filler to the inside of the shelves I cut down some 3/4 inch pine down into strips of about 1 inch thick I cut down enough to be able to chop down sections so that I could put four sections inside of each one of the shelves then I just added some glue and laid them out they don't have to be placed very specifically here they just can't be on the ends I held them in place with Brad nails and then add a glue to the other side then I laid on the top panel to make sure that all the front faces were aligned I connected it all together with some Brad nails cover it all the front faces with glue and then added my actual shelf face I use lots of Brad nails to hold this in place this whole thing is going to look very rustic and it's going to be stained and so kind of the more damage you do at this point the more realistic it looks I used a rasp so just tear up this clean edge that I gotten from the table saw I made a lot of dents and scratches and just kind of mess it up on purpose and then I went back with an orbital sander and smoothed it out I left some of the dents and the imperfections there but I got rid of anything that would hurt you if you touched it and my friends wanted a really dark stain for this and I was hesitant at first but it ended up turning out really cool it blended the different types of wood together between the pine and whatever it was on the face from the pallet and I thought it worked out pretty well I'm not a big fan of staining usually but I like the way that these look the last thing to make were two more strips of pine for each one of the shelves then it was time for install we marked the center point for each one of the shelves I finally got to try out this new laser level from Leica I made my marks and lined up the laser with it and that made it super easy to transfer those marks to both sides of this inset normally an inset like this would be kind of a pain to get everything level but this device was really nice I'll put a link to it down in the description for each one of the brackets I transfer the marks on to a piece of pine and then I drilled a hole right through the center of it I made sure to transfer these so that I didn't accidentally drill through any grout lines I wanted to make sure I was drilling into brick I drilled the holes with a masonry bit and then I attached the bracket with some tapcon screws make sure you use the right size bit for the screws that you have the opposite side was drywall and I did basically the same process but I used the pine to drill some pilot holes then I used a bigger bit to make holes big enough for the anchors that I was going to use these anchors hold about a hundred pounds of piece so between two of them on one side and the brick on the other side these shelves will be plenty strong then I screwed the brackets right into the anchors each one of the shelves just slides right onto the brackets they were a little tight which is a good thing and I had to kind of jam them in place but that made it so that there were no gaps on the outsides if yours weren't so tight you could run a small screw down through the top of each shelf into the bracket to secure it so that's about it they're really easy to make in the size and shape don't really matter very much you could make these a lot thicker if you wanted to you could even make them skinnier if you really wanted to the big thing is making sure you have a strong enough cleat on the side to hold up the shelf and whatever weight you're going to put on top of it I hope you liked this one and if you did let me know in the comments down below or at I like to make stuff calm I'd love to see some stuff that you were working on so please share it with me on any of the social networks I've got a lot more projects and playlists and stuff for you to check out as well as a couple of other types of floating shelves if you like these videos and you want to help support what I'm doing
