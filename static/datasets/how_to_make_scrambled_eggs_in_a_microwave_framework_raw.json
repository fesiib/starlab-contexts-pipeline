        "content": "well looking at my mousepad here I think I'm cravin either NASCAR or M&amp;Ms all right Cory Draper here mr. mr. cook mr. breakfast all right now check this out I meant to do this a week or two ago but okay see this contraption here it's nine bucks and ninety-five cents at Walgreens and it's one of those put eggs in put it in the microwave and voila fluffy scrambled eggs okay so what I did I went and bought me some scrambled eggs or I mean some eggs okay and I got my cheese love cheese I've salt and pepper I bought it I got a little plate here just in case I make a mess okay now this is what I did okay see the inside line right there it says to fill up eggs cheese you know whatever you're gonna put in your eggs you can put in a lot of things in scrambled eggs that's for sure but what I do is I just put in five eggs okay and you just kind of like you know mess them up a little bit I probably should have done this before I started filming I know how exciting this must look watching eggs get beat okay now if you look inside there it looks like Owens juice okay all right and you can buy those liquid eggs you know that are already in a milk carton that's kind of cheating I'm like no I want to go through the whole process here okay it says if you're gonna use like four or five eggs to cook for about two and a half minutes okay so what we're gonna do is open up the old microwave okay it says just simply you know here's the the it's kind of a rubber seal device okay you like that can make sure it's on there and then it has a little hole for breathing you can also probably smoke weed with this okay put that right in the middle oh this works okay I'm gonna just it says about 2 to 20 so all right let's do it okay so right now I got a couple minutes to kill so like I said not kind of dirty a good plate I just went gut Kranthi one here I hope this works okay pepper got the eggs okay what should I have for a little drinky should I have some orange Pootie Tang that's right I like tang I know everybody makes fun of it and stuff but you know what I'm gonna have orange tang with my orange eggs all right let's open this up here okay we got about two minutes left I'm up the creek okay when you're mister party egg maker Red Solo Cup I'm so hardcore on the whole Red Solo Cup like these are though these are like want some Peter glass and look at the size of these bastards they're giant Oh roll man I love tying okay now the astronauts they drank this stuff so that means it's probably good for you it's not a hundred percent sugar okay look at it smoke ooh baby it's like Jeff Spicoli is in the house okay let's see we got about a minute to kill of course let's see sodium and I bet oh my god is that 22 grams of sugar oh great and have a heart attack here I try not to eat sugar but okay here we go we've got about 50 seconds well it's in there spinning gotta tell you what it smells killer God it definitely smells like eggs okay well we gotta kill some time oh there's Howard Stern well you know what sad see this girl right here she actually passed away it was a good buddy of Mines best friend Tiffany if you guys remember Tiffany burning game great Penthouse Pet that was one of her best friends I met when she passed away years ago I think cancer damn cancer all right there's my Tesla plaque oh you know what Michael man I was gonna show you this the other day where American Graffiti junkies look at this at an oil painting made here and it's actually signed by a Paula Matt who played John Milner in the movie I'm not really a Star Wars fan but I like George Lucas's American Graffiti I'm such a junkie look at this like I collect Hot Wheels as you guys know here's my prize don't look at this one look at that baby yeah yeah all right a little 32 Ford coupe okay I'm kind of nervous wonder if this doesn't work I'm gonna be so embarrassed I just wasted three minutes okay it's kind of hot so the trick is is to get it out it's hotter than hell to the hard part out of the microwave without one of those little mittens what you got to be kidding well I mean no I'll hand it to the it looks like scrambled eggs if you guys remember I just put it in it's kind of hot so I'm kind of trying to get it out oh my god I guess I got to scoop it out all right let's get a I think I'm gonna use it oh man they got they're fluffy they're like super fluffy I mean you guys know scrambled eggs I mean they might not look very good on this video but they smell killer they're super fluffy hmm okay like I said I know this probably looks gross but the best part about scrambled eggs is you you know some people put ketchup on them you know some people do this and people do that but anyone that knows me knows that I put cheese on top of cheese yeah god yes put this bastard on there okay there we go okay this is the $10 god you smell good as hell okay you know I don't mind some salt and pepper on my eggs I don't too much a little I'm gonna put too much pepper just a little bit of salt okay there we go okay well um damn they're scalding hot I'm just gonna try a bite and if you hear me spitting it out and yell it and run in to drink something okay here we go so it's my yellow no no they're not really instant eggs I mean they're real eggs and you know like I said I wouldn't got one of those little things at Walgreens okay here we go hmm and you know if you like just scrambled eggs real quick and put cheese on it I mean they're not too bad I don't look gross but like I say you put some cheese on this stuff delicious okay well that's it and you know you can just go you know wash it out and do it again and again well that's it folks I'd recommend probably just cooking it for like two minutes and then add it you know because I just guessed it 220 but there you go man I just put four eggs in this little thing and you got like the world's fastest scrambled eggs without making a mess because you just go wash that out and then just throw the damn plate away okay that's it I'm gonna go eat see you bye ",

        "content": "hello everyone keeps asking you to make something and put it on a video so this is my first ride today I'm going to enjoy doing something that's kind of like those immense ground X that you get in hotels but we're gonna make it all the different with some other stuff inside I don't want to make it with a broccoli and feta cheese but the kids don't seem to like that so today we're gonna use now don't like giant bacon this cheese mushrooms so normally for the meal for the whole family I need a dozen eggs but I have loved because yesterday I made a lovely cake for some 170 X I'm here got some shell over there so my secret is to use the shell to get it show out now we're gonna wash your hands so have my like 12 X 11 X in my bowl I'm gonna punch a hole into each of them and then beat them now I'm going to add in I guess about a cup of milk however much milk I just guess a little bit of bacon I'm really not sure if I could just put the man on have them cook in the oven so for today but the first if you know if they'll cook within the eggs please leave the comment down below so I'm going to put my IDs and stuff right into the pound without any oil or butter or anything because it's picking up a degree so I'm going to turn that long got my big chunky bacon bits in like God let me show you what those look like no I had originally wanted to put some fresh mushrooms in there which I would have cooked up with the bacon grease but it turns out I used all the mushrooms for a salad last night so I did find some kind of mushrooms in my cupboard which obviously aren't as good but so these are our something you'll do puppy chomping yellow means mushrooms and that is Paris so I'm going to and I'm going to drain them and if it looks like I need some sort of pain or struggling that's because I am I recently have three operations done on my left wrist and it hurts and although I like to use it a little bit now I'm still read learning how to use it so I'm going to take my something young or mushrooms and I'm actually just gonna throw them in with the bacon bits I'm gonna wash my hands again because so let me show you what this looks like now so I'm gonna stir that up a bit it's still heating up so I'm gonna let that heat up this is what my egg mixture looks like I'm gonna show you my super cool bowl it's metal and I use it for anything that doesn't go into the microwave have this rubber thing on the bottom which stops the bowl from sliding around when I'm using it which is awesome I love this bowl okay so while I'm waiting for the mushrooms they tend to heat up they don't need to cook I just need to heat up we're going to start getting everything else the original recipe that I found for this set to grease the perineum or whatever it is you're gonna cook it in shut that and it makes it really really greasy and that's really not the taste that I went for so I prefer to just leave it the way it is my music Glasspool not it's fine so I'm gonna add some spices to my egg mix so we're going to add some salt which in Francisco said so of course I'm going to answer it which is different I don't know they've been here my they can chunky stuff simmering I'm also going to add some garlic which is Francesco I ate I fell and it's pronounced I like a burner can edit in chalk because I'm fresh I'm not French I just do my church that's about anything like Italian seasoning here but myself Louis this one is salad seasoning what is varsity now I'm going to stir up my bacon stuff again and this is my egg mixture I'm just gonna beat that with a fork now notice whether they walk there because again I he is a monument last night or something else amenities for dinner so since we're in France we have a lot of cheese this is goat cheese unfortunately it has a little bit of mold on it they sell it that way here since I'm allergic to penicillin I take that a lot so I'm going to take all these movies it's cutting off and throw it into my egg mixture I think I affordably prefer a chair in this I guess need to use whatever cheese you have no there seems to be a lot of mold on the phone I don't I seem to be the only one in the house that does not eat the mole normally we have two types of cheese moldy cheese which three sounds pretty disgusting but the breath simple of it most of them anyway here in my house they love it I do not love it so yes I've tried it I've tried several different types of moldy cheese just a little bite I haven't died like since there is penicillin in it I'm not going to eat it all the time see how long it takes before I die so that's like my big gun unless you himself is ready so I just took that off the heat and I'm going to put my now on moldy built cheese in here trying to make sure to keep the moldy parts away so how my goat cheese and then my bacon mushrooms are ready to go into the egg mixture egg mixture looks like this there's my bacon and mushrooms since I've hurt my restaurant there's no way I'm gonna be able to hold the camera show you into this bowl put the bacon egg mixture and now I'm going to put it in the box baking sheet that I use to cook so this is what my egg mixture looks like once it's in the glass bowl but I'm gonna use so I now preheated my oven to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit which for me and Prague's is gas mark 6 I've got to slide my eggs in now when the oven is preheated and I'm going to cook them for about 40 minutes now 40 minutes really depends on what you put inside them if it's just eggs you might get away with 20 minutes but the more stuff you put inside the longer it's gonna take to cook so like I said earlier usually I use broccoli feta cheese everything else is the same with the nap in the eggs and whenever herbs and spices you decide to put in and it takes about 40 minutes to cook and about halfway through you want to pull that out and I'm gonna just stir it up use a spatula to stir it up a bit that's what's gonna make it fluffy you can do that more than once if you want but I just didn't want half way through so this time I'm gonna try 40 minutes with my bacon and mushrooms by little stir it 20 minutes in our porno and we'll see if it's ready okay so these are our eggs at 20 minutes I'm just going to oh well I was going to try to stir them up a bit with one hand well I put the camera this isn't really working so maybe I'll stir them up and then show you so there's the external it appears that they are cooking a lot faster than with the broccoli and feta so I'm gonna close up this oven and I guess we'll see what happens okay so here it is it actually took less time to cook then with the broccoli and feta I guess because there's less stuff in it so I cooked it for 35 minutes I'm just gonna let it sit for at least 10 minutes before serving it Bon Appetit ",

Kiki Sanford and today on food science we're talking microwaves [Music] have you ever wanted hard boiled goodness but not had the time to dedicate many of us have probably resorted to the microwave at one point or another I know that I have tried popping an egg into the microwave on at least one occasion but then you learn your lesson anyone having to clean a gout of a microwave probably won't repeat the mistake but what just happened microwave ovens work by creating electromagnetic waves in the form of microwaves that energize the electrons in molecules microwaves have wavelengths of one millimeter to one meter in length microwave ovens have a device inside of them called a magnetron which produces strong rapid pulses of microwaves DC pulses are created within the microwave ovens power supply which electrically heat a cathode causing it to release electrons with the help of a strong magnet beams of electrons are sent to special chambers that resonate at 2.45 gigahertz the frequency at which microwave ovens operate an antenna then transmits the current from the magnetron to the cooking chamber as microwaves microwaves primarily affect molecules that are polar in nature by making them rotate to remain aligned with the alternating electrical field of the microwaves as they rotate some of the molecules bump into each other the resulting friction converts kinetic energy into heat microwaves can pass through nonpolar materials that do not conduct electricity and that do not contain water this lets them penetrate more deeply into foods more rapidly than conventional cooking methods in the case of our poor egg here the microwaves excited the water molecules inside the egg to boiling this led to steam buildup inside the egg that increased the pressure enough to cause it to explode but is it possible to cook an egg in the microwave in its shell without having it explode I found a gadget that says it'll let me do just that the microwave egg boiler this microwave egg boiler consists of a lid an aluminum tray and a well for water but aluminum in the microwave well it turns out that as long as there are no sharp edges notice this tray is nice and round there's no place for the electrical current created in metal objects by microwaves to collect and create a spark if you inspect your microwave you'll notice that the cooking chamber is metal walled this keeps the microwaves inside the microwave now look carefully at the glass in the door the hole on the screen are smaller than the wavelengths of the microwaves which also helps keep them from escaping the thickness of the metal also comes into play lower resistance leads to less heating the thicker the metal the lower the resistance so this tray should be just fine the lid is lined with aluminum so the eggs are completely shielded from the bombarding microwaves you fill the well with water put the eggs on the tray set the lid on top make sure it's snug and then set the microwave to cook and you wait the end result here is that the water is heated creating steam which heats the aluminum tray and cooks the eggs from the outside in via conduction rather than the eggs creating steam internally and exploding so you had nice cooked eggs and no mess to clean up Hey but remember it's not just food it's science oh yeah it's fine [Music] ",

        "content": "good afternoon folks happy Monday and welcome back to another episode of Adam's eat prepared a good weekend let me know in the comments what you did you did making good and you back I'm just generally nosy latter-day video a forger to do something really simple and that's how to make scrambled eggs they might be thinking why the nosey showed us out of these camera eyes easy isn't it yes provided you follow a simple set of rules I don't if you've been to like a cafe or fast-food place you've asked the scrambled eggs you end up with this dry horrible grain max of just overcooked eggs and you know it's not really a pleasure to eat you know they serve a purpose they fill you up but generally it's not a pleasant experience so I'm going to show you my method on how to get really gorgeous still keep soft buttery scrambled eggs that I'm not drive and they're just a real clarity and three things to remember when making scrambled eggs is make sure your eggs are fresh and they're less free-range those absolutely no excuse not to buy free-range eggs these days so cheap enough the second thing is when you season your eggs always add salt at the end just before your back to serve it because if you add salt to the mixture when you whisked it it has a tendency to break down the right and you can get a watery egg and the first thing is don't have any milk if you cook scrambled eggs properly you just don't need it and one other thing as well is don't I so I'm saying I'm telling you what to do right but I'm just trying to help you make really good scrambled eggs but don't put them in the microwave because I don't know just don't place the same if you microwave scrambled eggs they come out a bit dry and the kind of separates so you end up with like a watery puddle in the bottom and yeah they just don't taste very nice at all just done in a pan really simply and will be perfect so as per usual folks if you hit that pause phone make a list of what you need get your knocking down it crack on whether jokes me well so the first thing we're going to do is crack our eggs into a bowl I'm going to use four eggs because that's enough for two people or one really hungry person just crack them in like so and then we're going to take our fork and just gently whisk them together that all the yolks are broken okay until they're mix like so then have some pepper I'm going to add just a pinch of chive just because it's nice you don't have to have this of course through so that she makes it it done now we're ready to cook now I'm using a saucepan here and you could use a frying pan but I find that if you cook it in a saucepan like this with nice deep sides you have much more control because if you use a frying pan but he is distributed across quite a large surface so you run the risk of Osteopathy use a nice deep sided pan and that will stop it happening we're going to get the gas on nice and low and add a knob of butter and then just wait until that's melted and then we'll add the eggs so now the butter is melted we can go and add our eggs just give it a final whisk get them in and I'm using a spatula here the reason for that is because you can get much better control and you want to start immediately pulling in the curds because they will set right on the outside edge to just start bringing them in nice and gently and this will come together really really quickly so make sure you've got your toast or anything else that you're having with it ready if it looks like it's cooking too quickly just take it off the heat a second gently move them around treating with a bit of care again nicely put it back on the heat and they are almost cooked it's going to take literally a few more seconds and these will be ready okay now I'm going to turn off the heat because they are practically there because remember there's going to be a bit if he left in that pan so we don't want to completely overcook them move it around in that residual heat now we're going to go in with a little pinch of salt you can see how creamy they are and that is your scrambled egg done so let's serve it up I'm gonna trot I also got play here just going to add some toast and then we'll add our gorgeous silky smooth scrambled eggs and I finish it off with just another pinch of chives and then we have a folks that is my scrambled egg really easy to do so let's have a taste right here we are folks then scrambled eggs lovely and smooth and buttery and just delicious and it's all mine just dig in ever tried they're buttery really creamy and not dry an overcooked those chives also give it a nice bun mini-cons just in the background and they're absolutely delicious and there we are folks scrambled eggs really simple to do take your time with it put some love into it and you'll get perfect scrambled eggs every single time let me know in the comments what you think of my method and also if you've got any different ways of doing it show those as well and just quickly before I go I want to do a quick shout out to one of my subscribers and that's miss mercy thanks for leaving such a wonderful comments and for being a subscriber I really do appreciate it and I'll see you all on Friday for more tasty fun and frolic and cut out for now [Music] legs [Music] you ",

your necklaces on you wanna go for hoorah then go for a car ride yeah we're not going anywhere special I might be able to take you over to the dog park let's go let me put this on Oh baby girl I haven't put your necklace on yet doofus I want to show you all this persons parking job if they're still here yeah I think they are look at that that is awesome totally Nelda did so you went in there wipe it up before she peed I'm all right I'm all right or you could have wiped it off when you realized you be the first time but yes I do appreciate you going in there wiping it off I just sweat me like five minutes for she did and then she's like I gotta pee I was like oh I just peed on the seat no no it's gonna be better seen you wipe it off before for me well because sometimes it's like my pregnant sit in it yes and then I see nothing I'm like seriously know what the answer anyway pad no no no no oh oh where did it go hey Stacey I am like what is this you're gonna ruin a shirt no no shirts or anything will be ruined in the making of this are you sure for this this is one of my freakin dankest jumping experiments that I'm going to try I've saw that's all I saw I saw somebody doing on the Internet or ecology I think did it it's like a little just fun experiment and it's how to have a boiled egg that's already scrambled in the shell so you shake it up before you put it in the boiling water and then you boil it it's a scrambled egg like you just peel the shell and you why do you need a shirt because I'm going to show you how you scramble it gosh so what you need is a long-sleeve shirt okay you need a long-sleeve shirt you need two pieces of rope or twine or rubber bands that's what I've just cut these are two remains of happened yeah we're keep it up this got my shirt right here and I tore I mean another title throw with your groomer today I've tore off I've tied off one in I'm gonna put one egg in here I've never tried this before so I say seriously I'm very sure I don't know we'll see if you don't drop it you put it in the long sleeve of the shirt okay you leave a little room felt like yay that like that and I'm gonna tie off the other end right here okay so now we're gonna tie this off so you have it in the middle of the long-sleeve shirt should you try that tighter it'll be alright I'm gonna be holding it okay not I mean yeah hey so now you got your long sleeve shirt you get your egg meantime I got my water boiling and I think they said you do this like 12 times but you basically just like get it rotating and then you pull so it's like it's is this a joke like it's not hurt me right like this oh gosh I hear it for huh okay and now you take the egg out and you boil it how long do boil it for just like 15 minutes like regular like one egg let's see what happens wait wait wait so it doesn't break drop it in your water oh gosh hang on it's not focused okay drop it in and we'll be back with the magic of editing in 15 minutes okay so this one don't blame me it's already cracking so I was getting ready to do another one and she came in open a joke was getting a spoon and he like jumped in the egg all in my shirt oh man oh I was gonna have to do another one well you can still do another reduce others oh Linda yeah now it's just gonna have gone just hanging off of it all over the place just not been about working oh okay so this is the third egg right here and it didn't work either and I think what it was is we're shocking them too much with the hot water so I've done another one and I'm gonna let it bring to a boil I'm having egg bring it you know it's not gonna be just like boom there you go because I think that shell gets thinned out whenever I drop it into the boiling water so we'll see what happens I want a freaking scrambled boiled egg and we're out of eggs so I know have you don't want any eggs we've got a egg sleeve show soaked shirt all for the love the experiment all right I'm out of eggs and this one exploded too what was the last time you tried to boil an egg and they all exploded like yeah and I let this just sit and then it slowly elevated to Wellington mature and as soon as it got hot enough I heard pop and I came over here and it was busted so I need to get back and try to find that video and see what I'm doing wrong or we just got trolled Oh what if it was an April Fool's joke I don't know thinking it was you can boil a scrambled eggs dude dude had like a video of it at the end he was peeling away a yellow scrambled egg oh my gosh I'll keep you updated on this I want a freaking boiled scrambled egg yo you gonna say hey tell me night-night okay you ready go night-night you me take that with me are you gonna take away the Eagle begin to build mommy cooking the pillow mommy okay so you okay okay I have it I'm gonna buy it ahh she's like you got the wrong in here don't look in your mouth no money yeah oh she's at whoa what they go good now look at Andy who's that hey go Oh you're going into bed you ever be in a bed okay I'm coming what oh they love their mummy they sleep all day and I try to walk home during the day and they would never cards on me but they still loved one to better mommy hey Dave every time I go up there my bed spots taken I have to push her over and she girls nah you can push her as much as you want she would like give you the most vicious growl but she won't even hurt a fly know what hey I love you you know what a fly in your ear feels like it would not feel like that it'd feel like oh gosh that brings might use bumblebees I'm so scared I didn't tell you all the other day when I went out the front door of our house there were bubble bees like blocking me and when I went to walk the dogs I went out through the garage purposely to avoid the bomb please after all that whole bumble bee extravaganza happened Emma always stays down here goes up with Daddy after she goes and checks on the ADA Bell yes he does oh my goodness and we need to go play with the cat wait before we go to bed but it's too late now okay guys we love go that was a boiled egg scrambled fail I'm gonna do a better next time I really want to perfect it so we can like have scrambled boiled eggs the ones on his video look disgusting by the way ha ha so we watched a video it's only got 9 million views the backlights terrible right now by the way all you have to do is google how to scramble a boiled egg and you will get the correct instructions but I'm gonna try to get in the future so watch out for that it's gonna go viral people said in the descriptor in the comments you have to let them get to room temperature first that's the problem that's why I kept cracking I'm sorry it's hard to steam I'm so tired and under the lighting on me yeah what am i G was that well I should have one where the guy's like doing this and the girls like trying to kiss him that should be like a couple emoji anew and I think their emojis and add black P yes they do they don't have any black people right now let's talk to all this come on what's up with racism what am I supposed to send emoji and myself looking like oh my god Ellen did a monologue on emojis today it was pretty hilarious my murders are all in the news lately hey leave a comment and let us know never stayed behind let us know what your favorite type of egg is is that scrambled or fried scarlet or is it over easy no scram we call it fraud themself even though they're very easy the word or sunny setup or something some wait I think there's a difference who is scrambled really small no ever isn't ever easy like you cook the bottom and then you flip it said the top is covered with white water but it's still running right that's a breezy but sunny setup is where you drive it okay you don't cover it that's all I get Stine shut up oh yeah I can't be good for you oh we got a new Eagle cam coming soon yeah okay I still believe even though we said we take it slow we'll see where it goes to already know if you're asking that you're the one for me you're the one for me the girl I'm good but I can read your mind I am seeing all these things between the lines is it ",

        "content": "good morning I'm going to attempt to cook six-minute breakfast complete breakfast in six minutes okay today we're going to be using this stone wave says gourmet dishes in minutes Stone wave microwave cooker nonstick handmade ceramic stoneware okay secret is the unique steam release chimney and domed lid design interesting great for dessert all kind of other goodies okay wait bowl with a non getting hot handle the lid very loose-fitting lid also comes with instructions on how to cook different things and stuff but uh wants to read all this right save that for later neither you can read that on a full stomach and we're also going to be trying this bacon wave as seen on TV cooks up to 14 slices okay so got the actual bacon weight products here also comes with instructions with different microwave temperatures this microwave is the 1,100 watts by the way I find that's the best microwave for cooking your breakfast it also comes with these little skewers they appear to be plastic just like made out of the same material as the bacon wave so let's go ahead and get started here going to take my eggs Stone wave here okay now it looks like I took that stone wave out of the box which I did but uh I washed it off camera before I opened it you know so I recommend you do the same before putting your eggs in here so I'm going to take this and you're going to break the yolk scrambled it a little can we feel your solid when you put it in the microwave they will they can and will explode okay so we're going to place the lid on there and when I shows you how to do this with the mug we use it the first cycle for a 30 second this one to heat for 45 seconds and the reason being is that I'm going to give the some of the wattage to the Stone wave itself to actually heat it up excuse me while I get the bacon out of the frigerator okay exact setup here is the bacon bacon wave I think to have three slices bacon this morning because I'm feeling like freebase three slices of bacon inside for now now judging by the pictures are on the box too they can be in this flat like this and skewer and is baking it a lot longer than this baking way excuse me snuck down so I'm folding the edges over like that how much that's going to affect it who are in the bacon that's pretty easy it goes right in all right even dad our business steward and that's ready to go excuse me take this out it's good it's starting to solidify so you want to scramble it up some more this gets rid of all the potential air pockets which will span inside the solid portion to create an explosion in microwave but since the Stone wave comes with the lid an explosion would not make a big a big of a mess as it would go to cooking in a mug in there we'll go for one minute sitting here and one minute okay what I'm looking at this bacon way what I'm not liking about it is that there's no cover I'm thinking that there should be a cover to catch any kind of splatter that would come up the bacon when you cook it we'll see if there's any of splatter I'm almost predicting that there will be the elbows had a big spider right there okay oh I got to put my toast in the toaster wall which you're 100% whole wheat gluten free no no - toast corn syrup which we should read your labels why they would be - toast corn syrup and bread and yummy that to make it cheap and poison you okay what happened take this out and before we look at its way of the day I'm going to cook the bacon for four minutes November only is 90 lat scramble them up a bit grab my plate go ahead and put this just like that now this thing works perfect I could highly recommend the stone wave very good the lid is kind of hot want to be careful there's no splatter on the inside of the lid and this white area makes for easy cleaning you know when you cook with a mug it's hard for a person with big hands to get all the way down to the bottom of the month to scrape out the leftover bits of the egg but this thing is wide open so cleaning should not be any kind of problem at all in fact let me walk over here oh just that quick it's clean ready to go for the next time you know another thing is that uh you saw me take this directly out of the microwave using the handle the handle did not get hot at all the lid got kind of hot the lid is still warm but it's cooling off pretty quickly okay the toasters just popped up go ahead take that out there so we don't have any kind of a accident what's the bacons that we all could see the bacon smells pretty good I hear it popping I'm worried that uh you hear that pop and I was a big pop I'm pretty sure that's flattered you're gonna have to check that out and maybe to make this work we're gonna have to cover that bacon wave with a something that's my thing but we'll keep the splatter contained within the bacon wave itself bacon wave is looking pretty good we've at three minutes I'm going to take a look at hmm it looks pretty crispy but you can eat it now but let's continue cooking for the full four minutes might be too much and we'll keep an eye on it you can usually tell by the smell with the bacons cooked or when it stops popping okay still here a little sizzle the ends they stripped shrunk up how they were overlapping a lot so that's good and the baking wave is holding the bacon pretty straight so that'd be a nice beautiful piece of bacon we got 15 seconds left that cook right there good little Morton's light salt on my eggs well a lot of important myself I use the light salt because it's a 50% less sodium and regular table salt and I like a lot of salt so hopefully that's helping me cut down all right let's take this out looks good smells good probably get away with cooking it for hot but if you hold it by these handle it's not hot but the the plate part here is hot okay I'm saying these uh skewers are not hot and they come out pretty easy let's put this over here take this one as you can see the bacon is beautiful very crisp mmm but beautiful nice and crisp and straight my god you gotta straighten it bacon in it makes it look like you got a lot more bacon than when you fry it in a pan where it shrivels all up and this thing here it did attach a lot of the grace if you can see that it's pretty cool so let's take a look inside value up microwave here and that's good in there take a look it doesn't look like there was a whole lot of splatter in fact I don't see any splatter so the baking wave I have to recommend it to it works pretty great as advertised and stone weight you can see we have a perfect breakfast and it probably took a little longer than six minutes because I was you know using this stuff for the first time and explaining and talking about it a little bit but as you can see complete microwave breakfast here we go all you need is your glass of milk and you're good to go get your day started I'm going to go ahead and enjoy this breakfast take a look at how Christmas baking in oh my god here the crunch all right I know that's rude but thank you for watching and I hope you enjoy your microwave breakfast in 6 minutes or less ",

        "original_title": "Microwave Eggs Bacon Breakfast Recipe",
        "category": "Food and Entertaining",
        "content": "hello food fans today in the kitchen we shall make breakfast very small breakfast I don't eat a big breakfast like I used to but it will have one egg of course I've seen they get before I have one slice of turkey bacon and I'm going to cook it in the microwave I won't be frying it and I won't be spending a lot of time with it so what I will do is place the egg into a microwave-safe container I use just a little bitty sort of a I don't know what it is it's not a bowl but it's a a container that is microwave safe it has the microwave safe listening on the outside of the container when I bought it brand new and what I will do is put a tiny bit of olive oil into the container the reason that I do that I don't want the egg get to stick to the container I'm going to put it into the microwave after adding the olive oil to the container and I also will use a paper towel I'll show you how I do that so let's get started to make our very small breakfast and something else I'll be having your course is orange juice 1/2 orange juice every morning for breakfast and I also have it a couple of times during the day I like to have a lot of orange juice that might be the reason I haven't had a cold in a long long time there's my egg one strip of turkey bacon and I'm going to have wheat toast up with the toast the bread into the toaster and make some wheat toast but for right now I'll show you how I put the olive oil just a tiny bit of olive oil about a half a teaspoon of olive oil is going to go into this container read back you're out of the way and what I'm going to do is just let a couple of drops just enough to cover the surface all in there yes that should do it and that will keep the egg from sticking so we don't want any sticky eggs and if you're going to be making more than one a course you want a bigger bowl or container or microwave-safe type convenient dish and what I will do is I will break the egg into container and I'm going to cover it with a paper towel when I put it into the microwave and I'm going to have the top of the container on the container but not snapped down just loosely fitting on top the reason is the egg will explode but it doesn't do any major harm or anything like that just long as I have the paper towel over it and the top on there just as a weight but not snapped down give it room to expand be right back why we will break the egg into the container and if you're a teenage boy who's never cooked an egg before never broken to me you've watched your mom do it you know it's real real easy right I thumbs there there it is the egg is now in the container I will cover it with the paper towel and the top of the container without the making the container close tight I will have it very loosely covered with something and I'll leave it in the microwave for anywhere between 50 seconds and a minute and five seconds and you'll have to decide after you experiment several times which way you like your eggs cooked and also if you have two or three eggs for breakfast you'll need to time them out to a couple of minutes or so whatever works best for you be right back the egg has cooked in the microwave for one minute by the way the dish does become very hot and they cook about the way I like it now I'm going to put the bacon into microwave by way we will have a banana I will have a banana and I'm going to take this slice of bacon and put it inside the paper towel like that and then I will cook this for probably 45 seconds to 1 minute in the microwave and the bacon is done very crisp the way I like it you might like it not so crisp but I like my stuff almost burned and of course the egg and I have two other ingredients that haven't mentioned yet red stuff I'm gonna use some grape jelly on the second slice of toast the first slice of toast that we use to make a bacon and egg sandwich and I'll put a little bit of ketchup on it because it's nice and messy on the first slice of toast I will place the egg in the big and some of the bacon anyway I should just slide right out there we not follow down just over here yeah nice little neat sandwich comes out to be sanic because I have a foal the other half of the toast over on top of it after put on some bacon and balance that there about a half a slice of bacon here on this and a little bit of ketchup here she can catch a bottle the humidity water that gets into ketchup bottles from high humidity places and they should get ketchup on there it's a good sandwich if you like it and some people think it just looks awful but I'm not an art critic I am an eater so she'll start with this and between this and the next slice of toast which will have jelly on it it will consume the banana it tastes like it was a fried egg because it
