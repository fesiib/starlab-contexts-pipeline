        "content": "Going to the grocery store has turned into an epic quest to find the perfect bananas. In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.\nBut no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.\nThe best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.\nSince this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...\nStep 1: Ingredients\nFor the Bread:\n3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed\n2 Cups all-purpose Flour\n3/4 Cup White Sugar\n1/4 Cup Brown Sugar\n1 Stick Butter, Softened\n2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten\n1 tsp Vanilla\n1 tsp Baking Soda\n1/2 tsp Salt\nFor the Topping:\n2 Tbsp Olive Oil\n1/3 Cup Brown Sugar\n1 Tbsp Cinnamon\nOptional:\n1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped\nOven Temp:\nOnce you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. \nStep 2: Mush Those Bananas\nPeel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...\nUsing a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.\nKeep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.\nStep 3: A Sweet Start\nOnce the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.\nStep 4: Mix It Up\nBeat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.\nStep 5: Flour Is Your Friend\nFinally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable. \nStep 6: Coat It...\nTo make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.\nStep 7: And Cook It\nIn case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched. \nI think you can figure out what to do after that...",

Warmly spiced with cinnamon, Morning Glory muffins are made with grated carrot, apple, raisins, walnuts, shredded coconut, and sometimes pineapple. While the list of ingredients is long, the process for baking these muffins is simple and well worth the required steps.\n\u200b\u200bThis recipe makes 12 muffins. \u200b\nThings You'll Need\n1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 cup shredded coconut\n3/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed\n1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon sea salt\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 cup grated carrot (about 1 large carrot, peeled and grated)\n1 cup grated apple (about 1/2 large apple such as Honeycrisp)\n1/2 cup raisins\n1/2 cup raw walnuts, chopped\n2 large eggs\n1/4 cup olive oil or canola oil\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\nBox grater\n2 mixing bowls\nSpoon or fork for mixing\n12 disposable baking cups\n12-hole muffin tray\nTip\nTo save time, use a food processor to shred the carrot and apple.\nNot a fan of gluten? Replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour.\nFor naturally sweetened, refined sugar-free muffins, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar.\nYou can choose to use sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut.\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate 1 cup-worth of carrot, and 1 cup-worth of apple.\nAdd the flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to a mixing and stir together.\nAdd the grated carrot, apple, raisins, and walnuts to the flour mixture and stir to combine.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, and vanilla extract.\nAdd the egg mixture to the bowl with the flour mixture and stir well until a thick batter forms.\nLine a 12-hole muffin pan with baking cups. Scoop batter into the pan using an ice cream scoop or small measuring cup, filling the holes 2/3 of the way up.\nBake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until muffins test clean when poked with a toothpick.\nAllow muffins to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

        "content": "Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?\nWell, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.\nHey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.\nThese chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.\nFirst off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.\nWe want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.\nIf you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.\nOkay, now for the dry ingredients.\nI'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.\nIt shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.\nIt's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.\nOkay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.\nI'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.\nOne teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.\nFor leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.\nSift it out.\nWe're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.\nGive it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.\nThis was melted a minute ago.\nIt already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.\nFor the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.\nThis counter's freezing.\nAll right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.\nIn you go.\nHalf a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.\nSo, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.\nYou wanna say hi?\nHe's eating cookies that I made.\nOne cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.\nLet's give it a little whisk to bring it together.\nIf you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.\nI used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.\nSo right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.\nTwo large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.\nIt'll be completely delicious still.\nThis is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.\nThat's 15 ml.\nWow, delicious.\nI'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.\nWhat's going on here?\nLook, it's turned into like a butter mush.\nThat's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.\nYou don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.\nA little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.\nOkay, a little bit of heat later.\nLet's give this a whisk.\nThat's nice.\nNice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.\nNow it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.\nYou could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.\nSo you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.\nIt's time for some chocolate, the best part.\nAll right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.\nYou could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.\nThere we go.\nThat's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.\nRest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.\nAfter those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.\nI'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.\nIt's gonna be different.\nI've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.\nAll right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.\nIn you go.\nUnlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.\nJust really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.\nI'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.\nNormally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.\nOkay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.\nIt'll burn.\nIt's just a matter of how it looks.\nIt'll still bake fine.\nWhen you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.\nYou wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.\nAfter the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.\nThis is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.\nThe chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.\nOkay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.\nYou need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.\nThis is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.\nRight, into the oven you go.\nOut of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.\nOut of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.\nIn the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.\nIt's really like soft all over and just delicious.\nYou've gotta take a look at the inside of this.\nTake a look.\nIf you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\nSomeone's making crazy faces behind the camera.\nIf you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.\nIt has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.\nYou've gotta check it out.\nNow it's time for a bite.\nOh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?\nOh my God, that is so good, so perfect.\nIf you like my videos, hit that like button, subscribe, and I'll see you in the next video.\n",

        "title": "Making Muffins",
        "original_title": "Muffin Master Recipe",
        "content": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.\nInstead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.\nStart by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThen line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.\nThen I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.\nNow it's time to put together our batter.\nFirst I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.\nThe batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.\nWe're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.\nAt first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.\nAfter 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.\nThen you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.\nThen I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.\nFor the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\nYou'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.\nThis is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.\nWe're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.\nNow at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.\nAdd in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.\nYou're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.\nThen use the rubber spatula to stir this in.\nOnce all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.\nButtermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.\nLast you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.\nStir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.\nNow if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.\nYour batter should be thick but also spreadable.\nWe're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.\nIt's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.\nYou can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.\nBake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.\nAfter 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.\nContinue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.\nNow let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.\nThis is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.\nI've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.\nContinue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.\nThen this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.\nThen simply fold this in.\nThen it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.\nOne fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.\nThis gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.\nAnd then of course bake these just as we did before.\nNext up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.\nFor a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.\nFrom here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.\nThe addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.\nThen just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.\nEven though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.\nNext I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.\nThis time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.\nCream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.\nYou could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.\nThis variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.\nNext I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.\nSo I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.\nThis is the master recipe with no alterations to it.\nI'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.\nThat means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.\nI didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.\nOnce again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.\nYou can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.\nLast I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.\nI've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.\nYou can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.\nIt really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.\nFinish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.\nI'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.\nGo ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.\nA streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.\nIt starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.\nThen you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.\nThen use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.\nThen you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.\nThen you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.\nIt's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.\nAnd of course the baking time on all of these are the same.\nNow you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.\nThanks for watching.\nYou can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.\nBe sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos, where you can find hundreds of restaurant quality recipes you can easily make at home.\nWe'll see you later.\n",
