        "content": "I was going guys in this video I'm gonna show you how I change my spare tire if you're watching this video it means that either you're subscribed to me or you got a flat tire inner side of the road someplace so what we're going to do if you don't have a vehicle like mine look in your owners manual should be your glove box and I'll tell you the location of your spare tire okay I'm going to assume that you're safely on the side of the road and in no danger so make sure your gear selector is in a parked position your parking brake is up and secure next thing we have to do is open up the trunk and you can do it in three different ways one on the driver side down here there's a lever for the trunk right next to the gas lift it up to with your key and the three with three your moult if you quit it's my favorite all right okay now we have the trunk open if you like me you have a lot of stuff in the trunk so your spare tires under this mat here so I'm going to move some stuff out of the way and we're going to flip this map okay now we can peel this back let's try to be careful and don't rip it because I guarantee this is very expensive okay and here's where your spare tire is located and on to the right that is where your jack is located okay for demonstrating purposes I removed the carpet okay next thing we're gonna do is unscrew this plastic piece here so righty tighty lefty loosey put that on the side lose it okay now they provided you a nice little hole over here you can put your fingers in there and if this cardboard looking thing up and you don't want to break this either see here I broke it already okay so under here is your tire iron here and your lever over here this device you're going to use for the jack this is very important so I'll take this out and set it on the side but if you don't want to when you're in a sided road you can dis pull these tools out but for now I'm just going to get on my way okay the next step I'm actually going to do is I'm going to check and make sure that there's air in that spare tire yes okay it's nicely inflated sometimes if you do not check your spare tire like you're supposed to it's going to be flat and it's not gonna be any good and you can't go on from here so next step is going to be is remove this other holder here okay let's blow up the spare tire careful on your back okay the next thing we're gonna do is remove the jack on there stick your hands in here fingers this is how it looks now remember the orientation of how the jack is because when you have to put it back you need to remember how to put it back in so right now it's secure so what you want to do is you want to release some tension here so back here ready tighty lefty loosey so now it's getting looser now jack is going to come right up and here's your jack now if your vehicle is equipped with a hub cap you can get your tire iron here and at the end there's like a little screw driver device stick it in side here and you pry around around comes right up before you raise the vehicle we're going to want to we're going to want to loosen the lug nuts first I grabbed your tire iron plug it in now if you're not too strong with your hands you can stand on it with your foot do that all the way around now you want to go any further than that if you will keep on going the we will come off so break it once that's fine next step we're going to do is when I lift up the vehicle now another vehicle there's a specific place or you need to place that jack so you can look for these notches over here okay with your fingers you're going to turn this all the way up to where it needs to be I fail to mention that your Jack needs to be on a level surface and stable surface you can't check this up on a rock or piece of wood so it needs to be on the ground level safest way next we're going to use his hand crank we're going to put this hook part right into this hole one hand here another one here one hand here the other one here crank it up just until your tire comes off the ground that's all I need okay now continue removing the lug nuts spare not the nut nuts there you go you never ever want to put your legs on them to vehicle start putting on lug nuts so in this case I got lucky with the rear it's the rear tire so I have the parking brake up so it's nice and locked so I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to Snug it down just a little bit more until I drop it to the ground get my lower the vehicle just enough until the tire touches the ground okay touch the ground so I am gonna make my lug nuts tight okay like and release the rest Jack bring it all the way down now make sure that before you leave the side of the road that you put your jack all and all your tools back into your trunk so guys that's basically it I want to thank you very much for watching my video I actually had to put back my my good tire because my wife had a flat just have to replace it I figure out this filter I figure out to show you how it's done and remember how to put this back so I hope you found this video channel if you helped you out let me know in the comments give me a thumbs up or thumb down and when you're done with this video be nice and rewind it so other people can watch it and I want to kidding Aloha yeah I'm weird oh and before I forget guys don't forget that you had a flat tire and it needs to be fixed so you have time you need to go to some kind of shop or dealer and they need to fix or replace your damaged tire so the next time hopefully you don't so next time you have a spare all right Aloha ",

        "content": "hey everybody transfer home in mechanic's comm today I'm going to show you how to change the tire on a 2015 golf SportWagen so unlike a lot of other Volkswagen generations that have the tool kit in with the spare tire our tool kits actually on the driver's side behind the trim cover now in order to gain access to that we turn these two handles and pull this panel off we see a styrofoam box now we actually have to undo the rubber strap and pull the box out that will give us access to all the tools that we're going to need to change a tire on our car now I did a video a long time ago on my Passat showing how to use the Jack book so I can actually went to the screw-type jack which is a hundred thousand million times easier to use than the old Widowmaker as they call it okay so in order to get the spare tire out we're going to raise the cover and fold it down like that you can see here there's a twist handle that's what secures not only the spare tire but the base block as well we're going to set that to the side we're going to pull this out of the way now you can either lay it to the side or if you really want to get it out of the way we can disconnect it by unplugging this connector right here and setting it forward in the compartment we're going to lift the spare tire out and roll it around to the side that we need to change the tire on okay a few things before we get started one make sure your parking brake is set to make sure your transmission is in park or in first gear depending on whether it's a manual or an automatic also I always recommend carrying a small 2x4 with you that you can use to place as a wheel chock I actually already have another one on the front wheel so we don't need to worry about this so let's change this tire before we lift the car up using the jack I always like to loosen all of the wheel bolts there's a small tool in your tool kit you can see here this is used to pull the wheel caps off so we're going to pull these all off instead of in a place where you're not going to lose them next we get our breaker tool and we break our wheel bolts loose nothing more than just a little bit we still want the wheel to stay on the car all right those are all loose now it's time to lift the car about 12 inches in front of the back of the quarter panel here there's a small divot it was really hard to get a picture so you're just going to have to kind of eyeball it if you run your hand along the rocker you can actually feel it that's the spot that we want to install the screw jack in now we can see that the car is quite a bit taller than the jack here so what we're going to do is by hand we're going to twist this jack up just a little bit next we're going to get the other piece to the jack which is the screw tool you'll see you'll see the little divot is actually right here now about three inches behind there you'll actually find the pinch weld of the car so now we've got the jack secured here I'm going to move it a little bit and make sure it's not going to slip out too far we take this piece here hook it in and then crank the car up now we don't need to have the car sky-high in order to change the tire we just need it high enough in order to get the back wheel or the front wheel depending on which one we're changing off the ground now that our wheels off the ground we can go ahead and change our tire out so we've already loosened all the wheel bolts now all's we have to do is just rotate them out the screw driver actually has a bit on the end where we can use it to turn these out by hand into them a little faster I recommend always setting these inside the toolkit so that one doesn't roll away on you we want to make sure we have all of them when we put our spare on now when we get to the last one the wheels got a lot of movement so what I usually do is take my foot and set it to push the wheel back onto the hub turn the last bolt out and then go ahead and pull the wheel off the car we're going to get our spare we're going to line up our bolt holes just like that and we're going to start these by hand make sure that we don't cross thread any of them a while back I did a review on a cobalt electric impact gun this would be super helpful to have in a in the case of having to change a tire but since we don't have that here we're just going to go ahead and do this we're using the toolkit only and I'm really happy that Volkswagen switched away from that old weird jack that they used to use it worked okay but it was a little tricky to get the hang of this one's a lot easier to use so now that I've got all these bolts hand tight I'm going to go ahead and lower the car down and then we're going to use our wrench and tighten it all the way back up alright our cars back down on the ground we're going to go ahead and snug these up as tight as we can and we're going to take to the nearest tire facility and get our tire either fixed or replaced all right guys that's how you change a tire on a 2015 golf SportWagen as well as golf and many other Volkswagen models if you have any questions or comments post it in the comments section below hey if you have the older-style jack check out my other video that I did on how to replace a Volkswagen tire alright guys thanks for watching and I will see you next time now I have to put this other feel back and if I bring it back like this ",

        "content": "so you got a flat tire on your moped okay so the first thing I'm going to do is take the rear brake cable off by loosening this this bolt right here there it goes it just pops right up now I'm going to take the axle bolt off need one wrench on the other side it's one long bolt so you move the wrenches opposite each other and then once they're loose enough you can just do it by hand you don't need to take them all the way off just get them loose enough so that the wheel slides these are the tensioners you just flip them out of the way and then you can give the wheel a little tap forward at this point the chain is really loose and you can just derail the chain by moving to the side and spinning the wheel until it pops off okay so let the chain hang out of the way and you can give the wheel a little tap forward until it falls out of the dropouts so now your wheel is off you can choose to leave the bolts on or off if they're getting in your way by rattling around you can just take them off take the parts off in order so you remember how to put them back on when you go to reassemble your wheel you have the axle nut a washer chain tensioner and the entire brake assembly and then the other axle the other side of the axle just slides out in one piece okay the next thing I'm going to do is take the valve cap off and a little bolt hold it on and use my tire irons to take off this tire so the way I like to do it is you get one iron under the bead and flip it over and then if you go to either direction either side find the point where it's just kind of hanging over the rim and before it goes all the way down and touches you can find this nice little spot where you can grab it again and you flip that over take it out and try to put pressure down so the bead doesn't just kind of fall back into the rim you move over farther push the valve through your finger and get the tube out and this tube is garbage taking YouTube and there's going to be a washer and a bolt and then a second bolt you leave the washer in the first one on and you take this one off these guys are going to hang out inside the tire and this one is going to be on the outside any regular bike pump you have at home is going to work fine give it a little bit of air just enough so that it barely holds its shape and this is what you're going to want when you're installing the tire so before you put it back on you want to find out why did my tire go flat you take the whole tire off and inspect it for any nails or anything you could have picked up and then make sure there's no debris or anything in the rim so most tires have an arrow on it it says rotation so make sure you get that correct with the rotation of your wheel so you put the first half of the bead on and the bead is this part of the tire it's actually filled with like a coiled wined of metal or Kevlar or something like that and then the way I like to do this is you just put the the partially inflated tube just kind of shove it in there and then first thing you do is put the valve in and try it you just got to kind of find the hole that the valve is going to go into that goes and the bolt that came off with it originally the way I like to do it is I start opposite the valve and you can just start making sure that when you're flipping the bead over the rim just make sure you're not pinching the tube anywhere because that's the only that's the way you're going to pop it so keep flipping it over work it towards the valve you want the valve to be the last part of the bead that you're going to flip over so when you get to a point when you you can't you're not strong enough to keep flipping this thing over the rim then you take your tire iron out and what I like to do is hold the tire away from the rim with my fingers from the other side and when I put the iron on the rim get your fingers in there and make sure you're not pinching the tube with the iron and then go ahead and flip it over and then don't just rip it out after you've gone in there you want to make sure that you can come out without pinching the tube really crucial and there you go it's on we also want to make sure that your tire is seated all the way around you can see the edge of the bead on the inside of the rim and if there's any spaces where you can clearly tell that it's kind of it's sucked in to the inside of the rim then your tire has not been seated and you need to deflate it and re-inflate it until it seats itself and this looks fine so I'm going to go ahead and start putting things back together the brake assembly has a slot right here and it usually lines up with a bolt that's sticking out of the inside of the swingarm so that it's locked in and it can't spin around you want to make sure when you're installing the wheel that you put it in the correct location because if you miss if you missed a little bolt and you hit the brakes this thing is just going to spin around with your wheel and it's going to ruin it so make sure you get this slot lined up from axle brake assembly and adjuster and washer and the nut put these on loosely so you have enough room to get it into the rim take your chain and rail it and then put your chain tensioner back on with the little nub facing outwards it's the way it works is actually you can see it gets bigger and then it slides the wheel forward and back to wash them same thing on the other side you have the same three pieces again and now you can use these chain tensioners to actually move the wheel you can see that it rotates when I adjust it and what you want is you want to have the wheel straight with the bike and at the same time you want to have the perfect tension on the chain the chain wants to have about a half inch to an inch of plate so that feels about right to me and then you have to make sure your wheel straight so what I'm going to do is I'm going to tension I'm going to tension one and loosen the other and that will bring the wheel over and you do those at the same time and you do it properly you can move the wheel over and keep the tension at the proper amount which is after one inch right so I feel like I'm pretty centered here so I'm going to go ahead and tighten down the axle bolts all right looks good to me the last thing you want to do before you ride off is don't forget that we did take off the rear brake cable so install that and the way I like to do this is get the bolt ready to be tightened but still loose enough so that the cable will slide in that squeeze the assembly shut with your fingers and then let off a quarter of an inch and then go ahead and tighten and then you have a small adjuster here and there's usually an adjuster up at your handlebar level and you can fine tune where you like your brakes if you like to be able to squeeze them a lot before they engage or just a little bit so just double-check and make sure that it's the way you like it feels fine to me there you go change your tire you ",

        "content": "hey guys and welcome to another episode today in this video we're going to be talking about tires now right here I've got the wheels and tires from my Honda Accord and these were my summer setup so I've got my wheels attached to my old rubbers and I've got new ones right here but why did I buy new ones how do you know when you need to change them well right here I've got my old tires and these are for my front wheels these are the old ones and these are the new ones can you see why I bought new ones there is absolutely nothing left on this wheel for traction last year when I was driving this thing any time that I would get rain I would be hydroplaning everywhere now with this setup this is new tires and you can see that there's a lot more tread in here and this is going to channel water a lot better than this obviously but when should you really change them so on the new tires there's a little thing in the middle of the tread called a wear bar see these little pieces right here those are called your wear bars and they're found in the middle of each one of your treads and this is an indicator as to when you should change your tire so when the rubber here gets flush with this you should change them and that is at two thirty seconds if I grab my tire depth gauge and I put it on the wheel on a tire it reads eleven thirty seconds and then when it wears down even more all the way up until two thirty Seconds or wherever the heck that is in the gauge you should definitely change your tires when your tires wear down to about this point it is very dangerous and you should definitely think about getting new ones if you guys are running with the set of tires out of like this that are basically balled race tires of like you know slicks this is not very safe at all when it rains you're going to get no traction whatsoever your braking distance is going to be increased the acceleration is going to be worse and everything is diminished with bald tires when you replace them with new ones like this they're going to behave a lot better than these now I'm going to grab my wheels and tires throw them in the Gulf and then bring them down to a tire shop so they can switch them out now lucky for me well actually not really lucky for me because my car is front-wheel drive the front tires wear down a lot more than the backs and that's because that's where the power is going to the car it's going to be transmitted from the engine to the transmission down to the front wheels only and with that being said if you drive it hard you're gonna wear them down a lot faster than the rears the rears behind me there have like nine and a half 30 seconds left which is almost a brand new tire these brand new ones right here have 11 just to give you an idea those rear wheels are basically brand new so I'll be throwing these on my front wheels and then throw them on the car it's finally getting warm enough so that I can do that and yeah so let's throw this stuff in the Gulf all righty so with the wheels in the car back there and meet here in the car over to go drive down to my tire shop get them switched over and then we'll be back at home now the tires that I currently have mounted on the wheels right now only lasted me one season now that goes to show how hard I was driving it but uh yeah they definitely need to be replaced and that's why we're heading down there these tires were worn down so much to the point that they were actually showing the steel and nylon the basically the core of the wheel they're lines of steel there are lines of nylon and steel that are made up and those actually comprise the physical part like the chassis I'm at what am I trying to say it's the structural part of the wheel the rubber was worn down so much that those were actually exposed so it's definitely a good time to go change them out got to get my goodies thank you for choosing from Hortons how I help you hi can I get a medium steep tea double-double with milk and can also get a vanilla dip doughnut please okay anything else no that's it here's so many far thank you uh so excited I got it now if you guys are from Canada you know that you know we have all these doughnuts and everything from Tim Hortons but the best vanilla dip doughnut is the ones with the sprinkles not the one with the little dots on it I can't stand those ones if they've got like the bars on them oh the best today these are white orange pink and yellow it anyways guys I'll start recording in two seconds we're actually whenever we get to the tire shop so I'll see in a minute all righty guys so we are one step closer to putting the summer wheels back in the car I just got out of the shop I got the wheels mounted there on the car well no that's Lila not on the car there on the wheels the tires are mounted and uh yeah we're on my way home right now the Accord is almost there it's almost ready for summer so yeah as soon as we get home we'll be thrown those on them actually have some traction again it's 17 degrees out right now and I'm stuck on winter wheels so as soon as I throw those on the car I'll be ready to go so see that little section right up here right on that that's the wear bar so when this rubber here on this side in the middle and over here when they all wear down to that point right over there you should change it so when it all wears down this is a very excessive because it not only wore down to the wear bar but even wore down to that rubber like these tires desperately needed changing but it's a good thing that we got them replaced guys they're on whoo front hand backs on this side or on and on the passenger side I've still got my winter wheels so this is how it's going to go down so to swap the wheels over from the winter wheels to the summer ones we need to remove the lug nuts of the wheel now in order to do that we first need to lift the car in the air now I'm going to be using a jack to lift it but I'm not going to be supporting it because I'm not going under the vehicle if you guys are going to be doing any work under the car make sure you support the weight of the vehicle with jack stands with that being said you can then remove each one of the lug nuts that are holding the wheel onto the hub now because I don't need the wheel spacers mounted on the car when I install the aftermarket TSW summer wheels I'm going to need to take these off and to take them off I'm going to need a thin wall socket in order to get a socket in between the lug nut area right there and the actual wheel spacer so take each one of those little lug nuts that are holding the wheel spacer onto the hub and then we can get the hub ready to mount the new wheels and tires on now don't worry about the brakes I know how bad they are I've got replacement ones actually sitting over there in a shelf but I'm not going to install them it because I'm going to be doing something different with the caliper I'm actually gonna be installing a four piston big brake kit on the car and I'm going to be doing that for the brakes change them all up and I'm gonna be replacing the backs while I'm at it too but in the meantime you're going to need to add your your hub centric ring and this is only for aftermarket wheels mounted on the car and then by hand put each one of your lugs on the studs now I just tighten this up but this impact gun doesn't go over 50 foot-pounds of torque and I know the wheels each one of these lug nuts are tighten down to 80 so I can fully use this too as fast as I want and it won't destroy and over tighten the wheels once I saw that step you can then lower the car back down low to the ground grab that same key we were using put it on the end of the socket and then properly torque down each and every one of these wheels once that's tightened up you can then lower the car for the ground completely and repeat that exact same process for each one of the corners now as the final step after the wheels are torqued you they need to grab your Center cap and mount it on the wheel I like mounting the emblem so it faces the tire valve align it any way you like and then give it a hit and that guys is how it's done if you can see behind me I've got my Accord that's lowered on the TSW wheels now in summer mode now if you guys have any questions regarding tires or anything for that matter in this video throw them down in the comment section below and I'd be happy to help again thanks for watching I'll see you in the next one peace [Music] you uh she needs some more low ",

        "content": "oh hello I thought I'd do a quick video on changing the tires on my K 16 I've done tire changes on other bikes but I thought it more appropriate do one on my own here we go we're starting with working on the ground as opposed to a lift to make a little simpler take the side case off I also like to take off the exhaust on the right hand side it's only two bolts there's one at the bracket at the rear then there's a bolt on the clamp underneath and this makes getting the rear wheel off a little easier some folks like to put a block under the center stand to lift the bike a little higher so you can weasel the wheel oh I prefer to do it this way the exhaust pulls right out next up is to get the bike into Top Gear by gently rocking the wheel back and forth while you shift the lever with your hand now in sixth gear the wheel is pretty solid when you try to spin off these bolts which are on they're reasonably firm and in the interest of time I use my electric wrench to loosen the nuts all the way I like to empty the air out by removing the core of the valve and and then popping the beat up on my Nomar tire changer now you've seen me change a tire before if you've watched my videos I've done I think a couple sport bike tires in a cruiser I think a Harley Road King the process is the same some tires are easier than others I find the BMW rear ones are a little tough because there's a low drop center but I eventually got it on and while the wheel is off I take the time to clean it up because it's a whole heck of a lot easier to get those folks with the cloth now than when it's on the bike also from nomar is a set of adapters for a BMW wheel for my balancer so you basically screw one cone on run it through the center of the wheel and then screw the other cone on from the other side to lock it Center it in place and it works brilliantly the balancing process this one actually didn't need a lot of weight at all considering the size of the tire very well and like the wheel I get an opportunity to clean some areas that are easy to get to right now for simple interest sake here's the driveline lash in the bike which I find to be a lot and also a neat feature which I just noticed an adjustable mud flap there you go once I get the wheel centered over the holes it's a matter of throwing in the nuts and then torquing them with my torque wrench I'll go back in a week or so and retorque them after I've driven a short drive and once again I'm cleaning up areas that I would otherwise be very difficult to get to the exhaust goes right back in the way it came out it's takes a little finesse you have to get the pike into the receiver from the header and then you also have to guide the bracket into a finger which I put a little grease on to help out and once it's on just tighten up the bolts you're good to go and that's it for the rear so I spin the bike around to do the front now we need to hold the front in the air and I just wanted to show you if I was to sit on the passenger seat I can almost Teeter the bike up but I'm going to put a jack under the engine up front hold the front end in the air so I start first of all by unclipping the ABS line from the brake line and then I remove the fender now I forgot to do this early on so but you do remove the fender right now for simple bolts then off comes the caliper retainer bolts and then I zip tie the caliper out of the way so I can pull the wheel off but I don't have any weight on that brake line do the same for the other side and I also loosen the clamp up on the right hand side of the axle so I can spin it once that clamp is loosened I can loosen the axle itself it loosens here from the right side the left side is the retainer bolt once I get the axle loosened I can actually loosen the pinch on the left side which I can pull the net a little bit get the wheel out just like I'm doing here makes it a little easier wheel rolls rate a second verse same as the first cleaning up areas that are difficult to get to otherwise after installing the new tire I clean up the brakes with brake disk cleaner very very important and next I grease the axle makes a little easier going in and preserves the metal once the axles through I tighten the pinch bolt on the left side so I can screw the axle into the receiver now to get the calipers back on the disks I have to open them up a little bit with an old screwdriver do this very very gently because it's forcing fluid back up the line and I reclip the ABS line and I also put on a tiny little zip line that I took off earlier and here I go with my torque wrench I start with the brake calipers then I move down to the pinch bolt torque that and then I follow that up with torquing the axle and after the axle is torqued I torque the pinch bolt on the right side and after everything is torqued up with the fender on and I go back up and pump the front brake to build pressure back up because that can be a real eye-opener the first time you go out for a drive if you haven't done that anyway fairly quick job nice and easy until next time ",

        "content": "hey everybody today I'm going to show you how to change your summer and winter tires how to swap them and for this you need a set of summer tires as you can see I have my rims with my tire there the summer ones and then a set of winter tires and if as you can see I have our winter rim a steely right there with a winter tire and you'll obviously have four of them I'm going to show you how to do one and you can just repeat the process for all four then you need a jack stand something to Jack the car up this is the one that came with my Honda Civic so any one will do and then you need basically a tire iris or something to take the bolts off of the tire just like that once again that's the one that came with my car so anything will do so I'm going to set this camera down and I will show you how to swap your summer and winter tires alright everyone here we go we're gonna start by jacking up the car so we're going to lift the car up off the ground now when you first do this you're not going to want to lift the car up off the ground to the point that the tire is completely lifted off the ground but just enough to elevate and you know open up the suspension there so that a little bit of pressure is alleviated so I'm going to take my jack stand I need to place it under the car in the appropriate squat you're going to want to confront your owner's manual for this but generally it should look like it's a thicker lighting on on the bottom of the car but definitely check your owners manual for where to place your jack stand so I'm going to place it under the car right now and we're going to crank the car up just like so now as you can see I'm just making sure that the tire is not lifted off the ground it should still be touching the ground and I'll show you why in one second so now that I've opened up the suspension a bit and the tires still touching it I'll do few cranks just to be sure there's not a lot of pressure tires still on the ground touching at the bottom making contact what are you do is I'm gonna take my entire iron just like this I don't even listen all of these bolts now you may have different a different number of bolts depending on what tire rim you have but you're going to take the tire iron you're going to loosen them now this might take a little bit of force so I'm going to stand up and just try and loosen them just like that just quarter of a turn just a little bit poor Durotan should be more than enough take it well you might have to pull really hard to loosen them but this will save you the trouble when the car is off the ground so to pull as hard as you can and slowly but surely you will get each of the bolts loose already now that that's done there's a tire iron inside I continued jacking up the car until the wheel is off the ground now that I loosened all the bolts alright so keep trying and keep jacking the car there are hydraulic jacks that will reduce a bit faster but this one came in my car so I'm going to free route and whenever possible keep going until that tire is significantly out of the ground jackin it up till you have a decent decent gap on maybe the holes cautious it plays my fingers underneath the tire just in case the car the jacks that fission car fills a wonky your fingers intact doesn't see that is quite a bit of space underneath now you know there's a decent amount of space underneath the tire so what I'm gonna do is I going to loosen these bolts and take them off completely so just like that and if you did loosen the bolts originally your tire will probably spin a little bit so you know it's a good thing that you loosen them from the beginning so take just tired I'm going to just spin the bolts until they come off like that there's one hook on to the next one I like to go I don't like doing a bolts one you know the ones that are next to each other just because I find that this is a much better method if you do that one they're next to each other it's sort of loosens and tightens the tire unevenly whereas if you go with like a almost an X pattern it will loosen and tighten the tire in an even you know evenly as much as possible at least so you take these off slowly but surely give your arms a little bit of a workout and then we're going to swap the rims and tires just take off this last one right here already now that you have all of the nuts taken off of the nuts over there you're gonna remove the rim and tire from the car now depending on your car how long the rim and tire been on the car its might be quite difficult you might have to give it to hammers to loosen it up just like that what should happen is the root and tire should come right off the car just like that and I'm gonna put this aside right over here I'm gonna go and get my winter driven fire over here just like that I'm gonna do face the opposite of what I just did with this rim entire regular so you know place the rim and tire on the bolts right there just like that make sure it's completely on then I'm gonna finger tighten all five of these just like that just finger tighten them for now and do it to the point where they're actually touching the rim so it holds it in place once again like I said I like doing it in a cross pattern an X pattern as opposed to the ones that are next to each other okay I go across as opposed to one two three four five tiny needs just like that then you're gonna get your tire iron and you're gonna really tightening them not to the point where they're insanely tight but just you know tame enough so that you can comfortably place the car down once again I go on a cross direction of pattern so I do that one and you do this one down here and this will evenly tighten satire it just really well aiming for that I do this one over here then I'll be listing right over here and then listen right over here and then once they're tight into that point do now that the tire is evenly tightened on there that was that point the point of that you're gonna take it we're gonna give it one really truly quick tighten all the way around just like that then you're going to lower the car not too far you'll or completely but like we did before we're a little bit of pressure is on the tire can I take a car and I'm going to lower it just this way just a little bit not all the way just a bit sweeter the point get some pressure you put on the tire and I can treat you put some force to tighten the bolts let's just go a few more prints over here you'll notice that you're using a jack like I am the one that came with the car lowering it is much easier than raising it up on your arms no need to use as much pressure so as you can see now there is pressure on the tire so why does I need to get my tire iron I'm going to really give it a lot of force the tech needs are here so I'm really going to crank it down as much as I can to truly get under stress get it as secure as I can on the vehicle just like that one final turn now that that's done continue lowering the car keep turning that jack or pumping it depending on what kind of Jackie pack I know this is tedious and boring but to the matter of fact is that they'll save you a little bit of money from bringing it into a mechanic shop or a dealership to pay for the tires to be changed and the registry changed let me Jack you a car and there you have it we've just changed one of the summer tires we just swapped one set of winter and summer rims and tires now basically do this and repeat this process for the other three rims and tires on the car and you will have swapped your rims and tires from summer to winter or winter to summer vice versa all by yourself and that's all I have for you today thanks for watching ",

us at one eight or calm your trusted source for quality auto parts in this video we're going to be working with our 2006 ford explorer we're going to show you how to change out your spare tire on the side of the road in an emergency situation however if you are not in a safe place on solid ground or don't feel comfortable performing this procedure be sure to contact an emergency roadside professional for assistance if you like this video please click subscribe we have a ton more information on this truck as well as many other makes and models and if you ever need parts for your vehicle you can follow the link down in the description over to 1a auto calm all of the items you need for this procedure should already be in your vehicle open your lift gate and in the back of the vehicle is a cargo cover here which lifts up and allows us to access all of our emergency roadside tools rotate the pin to release the tension on your tools rotate your Jack eyelet counter clockwise to loosen it once you've loosened the jack remove the pen open the retainer remove your Jack from the vehicle lift up this cap and rotate this nut with the tire iron counterclockwise to lower the spare tire under the vehicle [Music] tilt the spare tire up slide to keep er up on the cable and lay it out flat slide through your spare tile remove the tire from under the vehicle now it is fair to assume that the tire under your vehicle is probably dirty or a little rusty on the wheel this is perfectly fine just make sure you check that the tire does not have any bubbles in the sidewall that there is air in the tire it has good tread and there's no visible damage punctures tears or dry rotting that would be unsafe to drive on before jacking up the vehicle you'll want to chalk your wheel either carry a wheel chock or a block of wood with you or in most situations you should be able to find a large piece of wood like a stick or maybe a large flat rock on the side of the road if the vehicles nose is facing downhill will want to chalk this side if it's facing downhill at the rear of the vehicle will want to chalk this side or if we're on level ground since we'll be raising the rear the front will want to roll forward we'll chalk this side just the same as if the nose was facing downhill for extra precaution if possible you can chalk both sides of the wheel and we like to do the one opposite the vehicle on both side and end so where we are replacing our left rear tire we're going to chalk our front right on the interest of time because you want to get off the side of the road quickly fastest way to jack the car up is to start by holding the eyelet and just spin the jack around to get it to open up faster since our vehicles pretty high off the ground even with a flat tire this can save you a lot of valuable time well then place it underneath and all in the frame rail before lifting the vehicle use your tire iron to break all of your lug nuts loose one turn we'll then take our tire iron and this hooked the tool which has a square end that seats through this yellow hole in the tire iron the hook then goes through our eyelet we can use our tire iron as a handle to rotate it once you've got the wheel of the vehicle off of the ground you can use your lug wrench to finish spinning off the lug nuts now our wheel is pretty well stuck onto the hub there's a couple of emergency ways to try to remove this since you probably don't have a rubber hammer or deadblow handy we'll install one lug nut on a couple of threads and kick back against the tire to try and free it from the hub but be careful because that jack is not incredibly stable underneath and we don't want to knock the vehicle off the other method in extreme situations is to use the other spare tire as a hammer once the wheel and tire is loose from the hub remove that lug nut again and remove the wheel and tire install your spare tire as well as your lug nuts as tight as you can before lowering the vehicle once the lug nuts are on as tight as you can get them will lower our jack back down and put the weight of the vehicle on to the tire once the weights off the jack will remove it and close it up the same way we opened it once the weight of the vehicle is back on the tire use your lug wrench to make sure those lug nuts as tight as you can get them and as always be sure to tighten the lugs in a cross pattern skipping one every time to make sure the wheel is tightened down evenly and doesn't pinch or wobble reinstall your spare tire jack reassemble the holder here put the pin back into place and just tighten the eyelet up by hand until it's secure use your log wrench to tighten the crane up close the cap flaps your lug wrench place your lug wrench and I'll it away since we want to get off the road quickly we'll just place our tire into the back of the car be on our way thanks for watching visit us at one arrow com for quality Auto Parts fast and free shipping and the best

        "content": "fixing a flat tire is the most likely mechanical problem you'll have to deal with on your bicycle and therefore the most important repair to know how to do so today we're going to show you how to fix a flat tire you'll need four things to do this job an air pump a spare tube tire tools and a shop towel for cleaning up after the job the first step is to remove the wheel and we've got another video you can watch on that make sure all the air is out of the tube then take two tire tools and insert them a couple of inches apart under the edge or lip of the tire called the bead push them down together and a little bit of the tire will come off at this point you can slide the second tire tool around the entire circumference of the wheel and it will disengage the bead from the rim now you've got half the tire off to get the second side of the tire off you'll have to put the wheel on the ground this step is a three-part move pull up on the tire pull it over the side of the rim and push down the tire should pop right off pull the tube out on the tire toss it aside and we'll go into inspecting the tire you want to be sure that whatever caused the flat is no longer in the tire the outside of the tire can be inspected visually while we simultaneously feel the inside you can feel small sharp objects in the tire better than you can see them although you'll rarely be cut a light touch is recommended in this case we can both see and feel the staple that caused our flat however you won't always find what caused your flat I'll pull this out and we'll go into the next step now put a little bit of air in the tube note that the thumb lock on the pump is pulled up in order to make a good seal a little air in the tube gives it some shape and makes it easier to handle now put the tube in the tire locate the valve stem at the tires label this gives you a reference point for matching the hole in the tube with the hole in the tire so if you flat again you can inspect the tire for damage at that point now it's time to reinstall the tire start by inserting the valve stem in the rim be sure it's perpendicular to the rim and not cocked sideways at an angle first install the back bead by simply feeding it on with your hands a little bit at a time this part is easy until you get toward the end the last few inches get harder just use your thumbs and push a small part of the bead on at a time the tire will pop right on at the end continue with the second or top bead just like on the first bead feed a little bit of tire on at a time with your thumbs you want to avoid using tire tools to reinstall the tire if you can it's too easy to puncture you know tube using them you'll see that the farther you go the harder it gets to put the tire on as it gets harder work with smaller and smaller sections of the tire make sure as you go that the tube stays up inside the tire that it doesn't get between the bead and the rim at this point let the air out of the tube that we began with also try using different parts of your hand to roll the bead over the edge of the rim now we're really getting to the tough part but again just work with tiny amounts of the tire of time all of a sudden the tire will pop on at the last moment and you're home free now we come to the final phase of our flat tire repair which is inflating the tire get a good grip on your pump so as not to damage the valve stem while pumping inflate the tire to be somewhat firm remove the pump with a quick pop so you don't damage the valve stem again before inflating to full pressure examine the bead you want to be sure the tire isn't going to come off the rim before fully inflating an easy way to take the bead is to spin the wheel at eye level the line you see should appear even all the way around if it's too high you'll have to deflate the tire reposition the bead and reinflates it's too low it may adjust itself when fully inflated when the bead looks good reinstall your wheel and pat yourself on the back you did a good job ",

        "content": "hello youtube welcome to fixit's our Channel today I'm going to show you the steps on how to change your tire and the most efficient and secured way bear with me and I'm going to show you these steps ok guys so the first step to do is we're going to put our flashers on because we want to be seen by everyone on the road next we're going to make sure that our car is on park position then we're going to lift our handbrake because we do not want the car to move while we're changing the tire it's very very important and now we're going to go to our trunk and we're going to remove the cover once I've removed the cover you can see over here the instructions are written on how to change and remove your flat tire from the trunk next we're going to make sure that our tire is in good condition before we remove our flat tire and now let's get started we're going to start by removing here and unscrewing here and now we're going to remove our tire as you see in the bottom you can see here's our jack right here and that's the other part to unscrew our bolts so the first thing to do we're gonna use this to remove the cover there you go and then before we install our jack we're gonna make sure to untie it in a bit our screws that's it just enough so when we check the car we won't have to force to remove the screws okay guys that's our next step we're going to align our jack with the line over here as you see the triangle right there and I'm gonna lift it just a bit till it gets into position there you go and now we're gonna lift the car all the way up to be able to remove the tire so now we're going to continue by lifting the car with our jack and there you go guys as you see over here I've lifted the tire approximately I have like almost half an inch space between the tire and the floor and that's exactly what we need to be able to move the tire securely and the next step it's going to be to remove the screws and you're gonna see now it's very easy because I've already untighten them before so now it's very simple to remove them and there you go guys all what we need to do is to pull out and all what's left to do is to bring our spare tire and we cannot align it like this we're gonna put our first knot then I'm gonna put the second and we're almost done and now what we gonna do we gonna tighten them a bit just a bit just enough so the tire won't come off once we put the car down and now what's left to do is to put down our jack okay guys it's very important once you remove the jack do not forget to tighten your screws this is very important and you must not forget to tighten your screws to the maximum possible there you go and now we are ready to hit the road but before don't forget to respect what's written on your tire because this is only a spare tire it's not like a regular tire make sure you respect the speed limit that it's written on your tire because it's very important for your safety thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe under fixit's and one word and we will see you next time you ",

        "content": "so you're driving along and something doesn't feel right something with a steering and under break in August an unusual noise you think you've got a flat don't just carry on driving as soon as you can when it's safe to do so pull over get out and check your wheels and tires now I think I've got a problem with this one don't think you can look at a tire these days and tell whether it's flat or not the construction of a modern tire makes it incredibly rigid this tire could have no pressure in it at all and it would still look as it should do the way to check is here at the valve off comes the dust cap and either check the tire pressure with a portable tire gauge which you can get for a few pounds from your dealership or from any car accessory shop or better still if you're on a car for court you can check it with a machine which could put some pressure back in the tire even if that was only to get you to a dealership where you could have it professionally checked out so I've got a flat tire and I need to change it but you should only do so really if you first made sure that you're in a safe place to do that also make sure that you're on a hard surface for goodness sake don't try and use the jack on a grass or a soft area I'm actually managed to pull off the road I know there's no traffic coming from that direction and I can see if anything's coming from that direction it's light I can see what I'm doing everything is in place for me to change the tire and so that's exactly what I'm going to do here we go a bit of a tip for you use the boot carpet the normally form backed and it makes the job a lot more comfortable here's the spare this one is a space server you'll be needing a jack and don't forget the handle we've got a big wheel brace here which allows you to exert a bit more pressure than the standard one which we also have which comes with the car and don't forget if you've not got the key for the locking wheel bolts you can't do the job right on this particular car the first job we have to do is to remove these plastic caps that go over the actual nuts yes they do look like the actual notes themselves but they're not right they're off don't get your car up without loosening the knots because when you try and undo them the wheel will just turn around right it sounds obvious I've done it this was in the toolkit it's the adapter key for the one locking wheel not which we need to release first so let's make sure that's in position now I could have used the standard wheel brace this lightweight one that came with the car this is a standard issue on you need to have had a decent breakfast if you're going to use one of these I'm a reasonably robust lad but what I'm going to do is rely instead on what I think is safer which is one of these aftermarket wheel braces we can get two hands on it and we can exert some real leverage so let's get this one off first oh yeah right so I'm going to loosen these off but I'm not going to set them off completely because I do not want this wheel to come off when I don't want it to they'll normally be almost always those instructions in various languages on here is how to use this Jack and where it goes most importantly where it goes if you try and raise the whole way to this vehicle by putting this in the wrong place it can puncture the bodywork and you really don't want to do that and worse still it can be a danger to you the person who's changing the wheel so I've had a look and it tells me that there's on the sill here there's a depression where that goes so there it is so got that in nice and tight just finger tight there right one thing as well if you are you view other people with you for goodness sake make them get out the car or if they're in the car their children and they're in the car make sure they stay in the car the last thing you want when you're jacking up a cars people opening and closing doors unnecessarily and getting in and out of the vehicle right let's get this way off just put these to one side there's nothing worse they're getting halfway through this job and finding out that you've lost one of the wheel bolts yeah right like to stick the space server on there's quite a bit resistance to space server tires and wheels when they first came I a few years ago but as well as I mean the advantage of liberating space inside the car and reducing weight which reduces your fuel consumption and improves your performance they're also much easier to handle wheels and tires have got bigger and bigger and bigger and heavier and so the spacer has all kinds of advantage but for goodness sake look at it it's perfectly safe but don't leave it on your car for a few weeks I don't want to see you in the car park at the supermarket loading up the car with one of these things on once you've got one of these on the only place you need to be going is a Thai specialist or your dealership just tighten these up now I don't think God put the plastic caps back on because I'm only going to be leaving it on for as long as it takes me to get to a dealer now aren't I they're all on so you've simply put them on finger tight at first and that's a good way of starting them off so that you're going into the existing thread you're not as they say cross threading the hob you don't want to force these bolts in to start with however once you've got them all finger tight it is good practice get hold of tire at the top here if it's this space server like this and just give them a twist in turn with the wheel brace so that the wheel isn't moving around at all the wheels nice and secure I can let the jack down and then I'll properly tighten those five bolts make sure this wheels on right yeah let's still the jack out but know that the wheel is firmly on the ground tighten these nuts as much pressure as you can apply on one of these four Weyer wheelbases it's probably about tides it needs to be when you're tightening these up by the way try and tighten opposite to opposite instead of going round the clock to make sure that it's squarely on the hub right they're all tightened the wheel is secure is pumped up and ready for the road again you ",

        "content": "How to Change a Flat Tire. Many people belong to a roadside-assistance\nservice, but if you're stuck in a remote area, you'll want to know what to do. You will need A spare tire A lug wrench A\njack Bricks or large rocks Roadside flares Reflective triangle A tire-pressure gauge\nA canned tire sealant and a locking lug nut key. Heavy tires, elevated and unstable vehicles,\nand nearby traffic can make changing your own tire extremely dangerous. Be careful, and always check your owner's\nmanual first\u2014directions may be different depending on the year, make, and model of\nyour vehicle. Step 1. Make sure the car is parked on a flat, level\nsurface far from any oncoming traffic, and engage the emergency brake. Turn on your hazard lights, and if you have\nroadside flares or a reflective triangle, use them to warn other drivers that you're\nworking on your vehicle. Consider keeping a canned tire sealant in\nyour emergency kit. If your tire has only been slightly compromised,\nthe sealant may patch it long enough to get you to the service station. Step 2. Find heavy objects\u2014like bricks or rocks\u2014to\nblock the wheels. Place them in front of and behind the tire\nthat's diagonally across from the one that went flat. If you have plenty of rocks, block both wheels\non the opposite axle. If you have a digital camera (or a cell phone\nwith a built-in camera) snap a picture before you start disassembling everything. That way, you'll have a ready reference guide\nof how things should look when they go back together. Step 3. Lay out your spare tire, jack, and lug wrench. Many tires feature a locking lug nut to guard\nagainst theft. To remove, use the special key tool\u2014the\ncar's manual will specify where it's located. Step 4. Most lug nuts follow the righty-tighty/lefty-loosey\nrule. Attach the lug wrench to a nut, and turn the\nwrench counterclockwise. Repeat with each lug nut until all the nuts\nare loosened. Step 5. Refer to the owner's manual for the best spot\nto place the jack\u2014typically along the frame, very close to the flat tire. Jack the car up until the wheel is off the\nground. Never get under the car when it's on a jack. Since it's fairly unstable in this position,\nkeep other people away until the car is safely on the ground. Step 6. Remove the lug nuts one at a time, and keep\nthem together in a spot where they won't roll away or disappear. Then remove the flat. Step 7. Mount the spare tire onto the wheel lugs. You may need to jack the car up some more\nto slip on the spare tire. Check the tire pressure on your spare regularly. That way, it won't be flat when you need it. Step 8. Replace one lug nut at a time. Begin tightening each by hand, then continue\nwith the lug wrench. Lower your car to the ground, and finish tightening\nthe lugs in opposite pairs, to ensure uniform pressure. Once you're done, replace the hubcap. Step 9. Remove the objects blocking the wheels, and\nplace the tools and the flat tire in your trunk. Step 10. Your wheel is ready, but you won't be able\nto drive as quickly on a spare. Check your owner's manual or the tire itself\nto determine the spare's top speed, and get yourself to the nearest garage so they can\npatch or replace your tire! Did you know In Texas Hold 'em, a \"flat tire\"\nmeans you were initially dealt a jack and a four \u2013 in any suit. ",

        "content": "today we're going to show you how to quickly change the inner tube on a bicycle you can also if they go flat you can also buy a patch kit for the inner tube but a brand new inner tube costs less than five dollars so it's pretty cost effective to just go ahead and buy a new inner tube some people might think it's a little tricky to try to change too but it's really not that hard on this bike in particular there's two nuts here that need to come on first to get the wheel off for this bike it's a 5/8 inch wrench so just take these off pretty quick come right off there's one on both sides you may have to hold each side while you're taking them off if there's a look at the type of not there right there okay alright so now the chains got to come off and you got to be really careful I recommend wearing some gloves if you're not familiar with bikes because you can cut yourself but you can scoot the wheel up which creates makes the chain loose so the wheel sits back and it's tight you just push it forward and get it loose all right and then you can get them get the chain off so start up here at the top of the pedal is and then you move the pedals a little bit and change is coming right off all right then you can make it the real life-like so got to get it over the breaks so now we've got the wheel off okay so the problem is with the tubes we'll start right here where the spokes are you can see that's where the actual air goes in to the tire right here where my finger is so you need to get that out carefully first so you start there get the tire separated from spokes usually a screwdriver is probably the easiest way to do this for time I'm just as I already know I'm replacing the tube getting them off of there there we go all right will came off so the tube is just on the inside of the tire so it just comes right out now like I said you could take these and try to find the hole in them and patch them up but really a brand new one it's like five dollars so it's not really worth it um alright go with the other tube so we're going to go try take this we're gonna throw it away and what you put here's the new tube flat that's never been aired up so basically it just fits up inside the tire you want the the where the air goes in you want that facing down so it just fits right up inside the tube just like that yeah shove it up in there all the way around make sure you get the right size for your bike this one was a twenty two point 100 size tube so it doesn't do you any good to get you one that's the wrong size I mean a lot of these are Universal though and they'll fit any bike so make sure it's in there that's all facing the right way a quick check to make sure it's in there and facing the right way looks like it all right so now the wheel is ready to go back on all right so it's a little tricky getting it back on as well what you want to find the hole in the spokes this is where you put the little nozzle for the air so there's the hole right there so that's where I start and I get get that part of the tube through first so that I can make it easy to get the rest of the wheel line up a whole London all right the screw cap back on it so it keeps the tube in there in place all right now you got to make sure when you can be lon you get an inner part of the wheel on the spokes you'll know what I mean when you see you'll see they fit right down inside here the tire needs to be on the inside part okay and the tube is on the inside of the tire so you just fit it over just takes a little fun angle in there all right so I've got the tire on all the way around got the new tube in there now all that's left to do is put it back on the bike and air it up all right so the trick to getting the chain back on is get the wheel where you want to get it over the brakes for this one in particular you got to push it through the bridge alright so when I've got it back to the brakes go ahead and uh-oh before you do that a chain around spokes first the gear and then joined up so we lose remember you push the wheel up to keep it loose all right and you're gonna chain up and you're going to turn the wheel a little Jane one Mecca all right we're back in business all right so cupchain right back up all right then the wheel fall back so that it's nice and tight that's where the will needs to go and make sure the will sit straight let's go back I have already been stripped by your tan you're older than what are you doing all right shirt straight all right what's it well that's left is the tighten those up and to air it up so I know it looked a lot harder than it was but really that only took me about five minutes so I should have only taken me about five minutes all right that's it ",

        "original_title": "Change a Tire",
        "content": "ah in this installment what we're going to be covering is how to change a tire with the tools in your car I took the initiative and called the Ohio State Patrol on this just to find out what the safest way to do this is should you find yourself in a situation where you have a blowout on the highway most highly recommended course of action is to get off the highway completely you don't want to be doing this on the side of the road especially on a highway where people are traveling at a high rate of speed if you absolutely have to pull off the road what you want to do is get over as far to the right as possible first thing to do is to press your hazard switch that's usually located on the dashboard as a red triangle in addition to that you can purchase reflectors or road flares that you could put out just to alert other drivers that yes there is somebody with a disabled vehicle and don't hit them don't worry and if you have triple-a or you know really big boyfriend or then yeah by all means contact them and have them do it for you if you don't feel comfortable doing this but should you be in a situation where you absolutely have to do this then I would go about it this way another thing you want to consider before jacking up the vehicle is putting the parking brake on now normally spare tires are located in a trunk or in the case of this car they're located in the hatch we're usually located under some kind of access I'm going to open this one this is normally where you would find your spare tire these are the tools that you will need to work the jack and to get the wheel off we're going to pretend that this tire is flat now here's something else to note and that is that many times when you get your vehicle serviced check the air pressure not only in all of your tires but also in your spare tire unfortunately this rarely gets done so you may have to specially request this and in some cases you may have to pay a little more to have it done because should you ever need it and it doesn't have any air in it you're really just wasting your time one of the reasons why it doesn't get done all that often is because in order to fill this up you have to take it out of the car and you can do your technician a favor by taking all the stuff out of your trunk I can't tell you how many times somebody's asked me to check the air in their spare tire and they've got you know 100 pounds of topsoil back a golf clubs dirty clothes phone books ak-47s no that was an ar-15 sorry yeah all kinds of things in your trunk so you want to make sure that if you are having somebody perform this for you to remove your personal items from the trunk ahead of time that would be very helpful a lot of times they'll say run on the outside of the tire itself in this case it says inflate to 60 psi a lot of these instructions are also found in your owner's manuals and also a list of warnings here on this car the jack is kind of in a goofy place but I'm going to show you how to get it out of here it's located in the back here over by where the tire was and what you can do is look for the side with the adjuster for this and then just twist it and this should bring it down to the foyer you can take it out now that you have the tire out of the vehicle what you need to do is you need to get the damaged tire off of the car get your lug wrench out and this little guy you'll need this too the next thing you need to do is loosen the lug nuts you don't want to jack the car up first thing you want to loosen the lug nuts if you Jack this wheel up ahead of time here I'll show you what happened that's not gonna help you so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to try to take the lug nuts off now this seems rudimentary to say in order to loosen things you turn them counterclockwise in order to tighten things you turn them clockwise these lug nuts may be on very very tight so you may not be able to get these loose like this in fact it's not very likely that you will so there's one of two methods that I'm going to show you our first method is to stand on that's method one now you may not have the weight to overcome this so I'm going to show you something that if you're very careful about doing you can do this but if you're in a pinch you can use the weight of the car on the lug wrench and your jack now what you want to do is position the jack in such a way it's going to come in contact with the bottom of the lug wrench like this try to make sure that this fits in this little notch right here and what that's going to do in effect is use the weight of the car to overcome how tight and lug nut is now if you wonder what this little hooky thing is for see how this is getting towards the end keep an eye here to make sure this doesn't come flying off it may get violent but that is that is an alternative method using no strength but gravity to loosen a lug nut you may have to try this more than once because you're going to need to get it in just the right position in order for this to work I'm going to loosen the rest of these in the conventional foot method now that you have all the lug nuts loose it's time to Jack the car up now there's a couple of points on cars modern modern cars usually seem to have these points and some vehicles actually have arrows pointing to these areas and there's also diagrams in some cases that show you where the jack points are for the car in this case you see this reinforced area right here right here is another area what you want to do is position a jack under this area so that this knotch fits right under this so it kind of cradles itself in there this is called the scissor jack usually a good way to get these offices to give them a little a little hit but sometimes wheels get stuck on the hubs and sometimes you have to kick them pretty hard if you're unable to get the wheel off the car which does happen sometimes particularly with the aluminum wheels what you can do is you can put the lug nuts back on but don't tighten them all the way leave them a little bit loose drive the car for a few feet or whatever you have to do and a lot of times the weight of the car will break them loose these scissor jacks can be very precarious you want to be very careful not to knock the car off the jack because if you do it will hurt you pretty bad and you don't want a bad situation to get worse but the next step is to put the wheel on okay now that you have the new tire on you want to let the weight of the vehicle off the jack so you want to bring the jack down again okay now that you've got the vehicle back down on the ground and it's solid you want to tighten the lug nuts one final time tighten in a clockwise direction you don't need to tighten these things so much that you're never going to be able to get the wheel off again just make them snug you've got enough leverage with with the lug wrench that it should be okay now that you have your spare tire mounted and take the other tire and put in your trunk is probably the most logical place to put it I hope this helps you should you be stranded with a flat tire at some time just the bullet points get off the highway if it's at all possible drive it off the highway loosen lug nuts before you jack the car up tighten lug nuts after you let the car down using the jack to possibly lose some lug nuts if you need to don't drive around for an extended period of time on these spares they're not designed to be tires they're designed to get you someplace to where you can either get your tire repaired or replaced but I hope that this bit of information was helpful to you if you have any questions or comments leave them down here or you can visit me at eric the car guy comm thank you have a great day yeah this is gonna be fun you might just learn something ",

        "content": "hello my name is Kevin and today I'm going to show you how to remove a spare tire and use it to replace a flat tire on your 2015 Toyota Sienna let's get started so we're going to go ahead and start in the rear of the vehicle where most of the equipment is located you have this little pull tab right here just pull on that and this side panel will come out nice and easy we'll go ahead and start with the extension arm that has a hook on the end of it this long piece here next to that you have the socket with an eyelet on the top those two will be used together to lower the spare tire next you have the strap which is used to secure the flat tire in the back of the vehicle and last the instruction manual here as well now still in the vehicle you have your jack which is going to take a little bit of muscle to get out it's in there pretty secure and next to the jack is your tire iron that's going to be used to loosen and tighten the lug nuts on your tire as well we'll go ahead and take all that out so we have all of the equipment out of the vehicle we'll just do a quick recap there's your jack right there the biggest piece on on the ground there and then next to that is your tire iron which you'll use to loosen and tighten your lug nuts next to the tire iron is your extension arm with the hook on the end and that will be used with the socket with an eyelet on it to lower your spare tire off of the bottom of the sienna and so those are kind of one package together those will be used together and then the tire iron is separate from that and then you also use the extension arm with the jack to raise the jack up underneath the vehicle and we'll show you that in a little bit now we're going to go ahead and lower your spare tire to do that you will need your extension arm as well as your socket we're going to go ahead and move back the captain's chair on the passenger side of the vehicle to expose this little cutout in your carpet now you may have to move your floor mats out of the way to be able to see this cut out but once you make it visible you're going to go ahead and just peel back the carpeting and the insulation while you have that held back we're going to go ahead and take our socket and place it right on top of the bolt head it should be a nice snug fit because it is the correct size go ahead and take your extension arm with the hook end and go ahead and just attach it right to that socket is going to allow you to use the extension arm to lower the spare tire we're going to just rotate it nice and easy remember to always rotate in a counterclockwise direction or lefty loosey if you prefer and we're going to go ahead and rotate until it actually stops rotating as you're rotating down this is what it's going to look like underneath your vehicle now this is sped up a little bit it will not actually lower this fast but it just shows you that you will need all the slack in the line it's not just till the tire touches the ground but you will need the slack in the line as well now once we have the tire on the ground we're going to go ahead and just pull that out using the slack that's in the line I'm going to tilt the tire up here so you can see the little lock that's on the end all you have to do is take that lock that's right there and turn it sideways and feed it back through the spare tire this will allow you to then use the spare tire obviously on the outside of your vehicle but you do have to turn it sideways punch it back through like that and then you're all ready to go to use the spare tire so on the Toyota Sienna we do have five lug nuts we're going to go ahead and loosen all five of these lug nuts just a simple half a turn before we jack up the vehicle so you're going to take your tire iron and it doesn't matter in which order you loosen the lug nuts you just simply go around and loosen each one half a turn and they should be tight obviously so it does take a little bit of muscle to go ahead and loosen those now that we have them loosened we're going to go ahead and be ready to jack up our vehicle this is the jack that came with the sienna and we're going to go ahead and show you how to raise up the jack so there's this little loop on the end of the jack and you're actually going to use the same extension arm that you used to lower the spare tire you simply just take the hook end of the extension arm and place it through that loop and now when you rotate the extension arm it's going to go ahead and raise the jack up so now I'll show you where to place the jack underneath your sienna now I'm going to show you where to place your jack when you're raising your sienna you're going to go ahead and notice this tire right there that's the rear tire that we just loosen the lug nuts on you can see the mud flap notice this little Tang metal that sticks down from the frame this little tang of metal is what the jack is going to be sitting on you'll notice these two indents right there and the tang of metal that lets show where the jack needs to be sitting so this tang of metal is actually going to fit inside this little slit that's within the jack so you place your jack in a position to where the loop on the end of the jack is facing outward so you can use the extension arm to raise the jack and the jack will be raised right up on that tang the jack has now been raised up against the vehicle and now to raise your vehicle you're going to go ahead and take the hook end of your extension arm just place it in that little loop and go ahead and rotate clockwise to go ahead and lift the vehicle up you can see the vehicle is raising up and now I'll go ahead and look at it from a side profile you can see the tire raising up and you just need some daylight under that tire and you're good to go so now you can see our jack is right there and our tire freely spins because it's high enough off the ground now since we loosen these lug nuts they should be pretty easy to take off and you can go ahead and just loosen them by hand I went ahead and sped this up a little bit once you have all the lug nuts loosened off the tire you're going to go ahead and be able to remove that flat tire now our spare tire is ready to go ahead and be put on you want to make sure you're putting your spare tire on in the right direction which means the fill nipple for the spare tire is supposed to be facing outward that way if you were to need to fill your spare tire you are able to do so even though the spare tire should already be filled so we'll go ahead and put the spare tire right on those studs may take a little bit of working once you have the spare tire on there you're going to use the same five lug nuts that came off your other tire and go ahead and fit them right on the spare now to tighten them up you do want to use a star pattern and so you don't go in a complete circle but instead you go on a star so you're going to use your tire iron to tighten them up as tight as they can go and then we're going to go ahead and lower the vehicle making sure that the tire is not touching the ground so you have some traction and you can get some force now you're going to want to go around first and just lightly tighten each lug nut in a star pattern making sure you're not going in a circle but rather a star so skipping one one lug nut every time and then you go around a second time and applying quite a bit of force to those lug nuts so that is how you change a tire on your 2015 Toyota Sienna from Metro Toyota I'm Kevin to look at other how-to videos

        "content": "good morning I'm bill Bergey with adventure rider magazine I'm out here with James Pratt and Shannon Markel we are in Logan Utah on our way to the redmond rally the BMW International Rally in Oregon and we're going to do a presentation on changing the rear tire on a BMW r1200gs adventure a couple of things we'll do before we start I like to kind of secure things for safety I've got a this is basically a packing strap that the motorcycles come in tied to my chest and into my front wheel and then I'm going to secure the front brake also a couple of little things to keep this box and coming off this understand as we move ahead on this you'll see why it might do that other than the mind that they tend to have of their own sometimes all right let the air out of the front tire and I keep a valve core extractor on the valve cap I also keep a spare in my tool kit more convenient the better seems like you're always looking for one of these okay we're going to break the tire down now the 1200 GS comes with a built in braking tool and that works quite well in most cases that is why you secure your Center stand and your front brake just a little bit of forward movement and that thing will come off of there and you'll be chasing it down the hill or caught under it people fight these and fight them and they're just really not that difficult to get off with a good technique okay okay when we're changing the tire it's a good idea to usually start and end at the valve stem in particular if you've got will tire pressure sensors built into the machine like this it's kind of a large lump in there you don't to break that off so you get the tire clear of that too before you ever get started so we'll get a tire tool started in that area push the tire down into the channel feet and then you can break it over pretty easy to that point all you have to do just pop it off now when I change my tires i lubricate the bead with silicone every time if you know providing a habited available it makes this a lot easier I've bought them a little bit to get them off but this tire is completely worn out as you can see and you know it popped right on okay we're mounting a cotton LT kcat back in place of a worn out continental tee kcat 2,500 miles of heavy throttle use on that tire these are considered a directional tire so you want to make sure your arrow lines up with logic and the direction of rotation so here again you're going to start we're going to end at the valve core about sim so push the tire in place and then we'll go back to the bottom again and it's on now we're going to re-inflate this I'm using a little slime 12-volt air pump and there are times when these beats don't want to match and seal to the extent that they need to so that you can get the tire to re-inflate if that happens you can take this band right here or some similar band and wrap it around the tire scrunch it down with a stick or tire tire tool whatever you have to to push the tire in which will help to get the bead to see it also you can have a buddy cup compress it up here if you have one on hand but you are going to have to make it seal because these pumps don't provide any surge pressure that will help to get that tire started on to the bead let's see what kind of luck we get with okay so since that didn't work then we're going to have to use the strap and see if we can get lucky with this we'll wrap the strap on there a little pressure on it try not to break our strap it's pretty pretty tough as you can see that's compressing the tire down we ran the motor during the initial inflation so that we could pop the bead with the pump rpm with the extra alternator voltage we get a little bit more pump volume also we ran the area initially with the valve core out it's easier to flow the air inside that will put about Quran andrea plate the tire of the proper pressure and will start the motor 40 psi tire pressure like your mileage may vary I run about 36 in the front and 38 to 40 in the rear for road conditions I'm carrying a load like this with continuity kcat you can get a little bit of flex if you get the tire pressure much below that the low end of the tire pressure might be 6 8 psi short story I was out at Toronto pinnacles west of Death Valley last month and I went in an area that was a deep sand wash completely loaded bike went to the skid plate I was completely buried I unloaded the bike did all right things to get it out pushed as hard as I could push I couldn't influence the motorcycle it wasn't going anywhere so I let as a last resort air out of the tires both the front and the rear down to that 6 to 8 psi range stood beside the motorcycle a slight nudge let off the clutch and it pulled itself out almost completely under its own power it makes that much difference the idea of having an inflator with you not just co2 but an actual pump allows you to put the tires back up to reasonable pressures all the way up if you want to Road pressures so that you can continue on safely and we're done so this is where you say what about the front tire how do you do that with it on the center stand well it's a little bit more difficult to go that route it's good to have a buddy available but with a good set of tire tools you can usually work this tire off the bead will do the entire process in another video but I do just want to mention that when you do that be patient keep a heavy boot on the bead and protect your brake this ",

        "original_title": "Change a Tire",
        "content": "I'm Mike Williams with lands camper man I'm here to show you the proper tire changing procedure on a Ford f250 350 and a 454 truck now 550 is done a little differently and I do recommend that you refer to the Ford owner's manual on the f250 350 450 and 550 as well as this instructional video now what you see here in front of me is the Ford supplied jack handles as well as the jack now the Jack handles include the lug wrench the jack handle itself as well as the spare tire removal tool now over here to your right you'll see the atwood jack remote that operates the atwood jacks on our lance camper as well as I have 1116 socket on a 3/8 drive ratchet to make it simpler and easier to remove the spare tire from the carrier and also we'll Chuck which is also important while changing a tire now the first thing we're going to do in this procedure is we're going to go ahead and chock the front tire we're going to be demonstrating by the way on the rear so we're going to chop the front tire here with the wheel chock so that the vehicle doesn't roll when we're jacking it up because if the vehicle rolls it can come off the jack and it could cause injury or death now the next procedure that we're going to go ahead and do is we want to take and get the weight of the camper off of the truck and also gain some clearance to remove the spare tire from the spare tire carrier so we're going to remove our happy jack tie-down from the truck and we'll want to remove all four of these tie-downs set that aside then we're going to go ahead and swing out the swing away if you have the swing away jack brackets on the front for the dually truck if you're working on a single rear wheel axle truck you won't have the swing away bracket so you won't have to perform this procedure so once you've done that you're going to want to go ahead and activate the Jack's and extend the jacks down to the ground extend all Jack's bring in the camper up off the ground itself we've got the jack in place we're going to want to lower the spare tire down from the spare tire carrier so what you're going to end up needing to do is you're going to need to get the key lock as well as the extension handle and install the key lock onto the extension handle then you're going to need an extension and depending on which wrench you're going to use either your ratchet wrench with the 1116 socket or the Ford provided jack alright a handle we're going to come on in back here we're going to go ahead and lower that now once you've gotten underneath the back of the camper here you want to go ahead and install the spare tire removal handle with the tool attached into the spare tire winch hole you're going to go ahead and put that inside shove it all the way into the channel you'll fill up a connection and lock into place you'll have a second extension you're going to apply to the original extension and then use your ratchet wrench once you got that on go ahead and lower the spare tire down to the ground so what we're going to end up doing is we're going to take the center cap off the center cap has four notches in it that's located up against the rim itself that's designed to take this hook that's provided with the Ford entire kit now the hook is insulated to protect the rim from getting damaged so you're going to go ahead and get this hook back into one of those brackets and once it's popped off go ahead and set it to the side now if you're working on the rear duel you're going to have to use this extension that's provided in the kit by four so that will go onto your lug nut just like so use your lug wrench and loosen your lip okay once you're done removing the lug nuts now it's time to Jack the truck up off the ground to get your tire up but you're going to end up doing is jacking it up until you have some clearance between the ground and the tire so that you get to proper distance so that you can remove the tire off the axle okay once you've got the truck jacked up off the ground and the tire has been raised then you can go ahead and pull the tire off of the truck go ahead and set that tire to the side grab your replacement tire now keep in mind tires are heavy so proper lifting procedures should be taken when you're doing the lifting of this tire I find it best if done put it on the center hub like so and voila once you got the tire on go ahead and reinstall the lug nuts when replacing a spare tire if it just happens to be the inside dually there's going to be a small diameter hole in the rim for the index there's a pin that is matted so that you get that aligned with the hub and the rim when installing the spare tire that has to be in place because you want to make sure that the rim is flush against the hub the full circumference of the hub now once we've got the lug nuts back on we want to Snug the lug nuts down to a point that they're slugged all of them before lowering it down to the ground and when you snug up lug nuts you want to go star wise so go across snug frost snug I tell each of over - tight against the rim once that's done then you're ready to lower the truck to the ground and then finish your final torque on the lug nuts and you want to torque the tired lug nuts tight Oh once the track attire is on the ground once they're tight then you're ready to go ahead backup everything and take it down to your local tire repair shop to have that spoon tire or that flat tire repaired and put on the back on the truck and get the spare tire mounted back up on the spare tire carrier so this is Mike Williams with Lance camp for manufacturing showing you the tire changing procedure on the Ford f-250 350 and 450 now 550 s again are different so please refer to the owners manual on all applications f250 350 and 450 and the 550 again this Mike Williams Lance camper Happy Camp ",

        "content": "hello there youtubers this is Paul here today I'm gonna show you how to change the spare tire on the 2015 Nissan Micra in the event of a flat tire the first thing you'll want to do is pull your micro safely off the road set your parking brake and turn on the hazards the four-way flashers and turn the car off you know you want to find something to block one of the good tires with so that the car doesn't roll the parking brake now the first question you might ask yourself either looking for is where is the spare tire well Nissan in order to create more space in the trunk has decided to put the spare tire under the car so I'm gonna show you how we get the spare tire yeah so the way we get the spare tire down is by turning this pull the spare tire sits in a cage and now the tool we're going to use is there's this extender on the bolt and then we're going to use the tire iron wrench I'm gonna turn it counterclockwise several turns to lower okay so you want to turn it enough times approximately 15 full turns so that you can get this part of the wire cage up and over the lip of the clamp now this is a piece of hardware you will want to keep an eye on you want to keep it oiled and clean during the winter months to prevent corrosion I'm just gonna go ahead and drop that after you taking the spare tire out it's a probably good idea to put this cage back up and tighten that bolt up above so that you don't have this cage rattling around us now make sure that when you Jack this car up you place the jack at one of the reinforced jacking points here they're easy to find they're located between two there's one in behind each the four tires we have the tools that we need to change the tire that came supplied with the micro if you need to you can remove the hubcap with this tool here it has a flattened edge I'm not gonna worry about it because my hubcaps have left my bolts exposed and now to use a jack in the by turning the bolts just enough so that we can easily take it off we're going to remove this for safety as well and once they're loose you can just spin them over to fingers if you want tire iron the tool has ridges on there for removing the security yeah flat tire and then we put the spare tire on and we'll put the bolts on finger tight I never like to work in a fashion where the next bolt I would put it would be across from the first one I put in just to make sure that everything goes on equally so just finger tight for now so of that one then that one then I'm gonna do these two here and then my security bolt I'm just going to give these a little little bit of a turn just snug them up they're not I'm not parking them down yeah and just just working around torquing them just setting them up okay and again I should work in the when I do one tighten the one up the cross from it and then I'll come over here and they'll tighten the one up across from it like that just bring the jack down so that this tire is just touching the ground and we'll do a counterclockwise fashion okay so now our tires touching the ground so I'll go ahead and I'll put a lot more force on these balls in the car down the rest of the way now the original tire will not fit in that wire cage only the spare tire tire okay now just to know once you've had your tire repaired and you're ready to put the spare tire back under the car remember that this side here with the valve stem duct goes up if you put this in upside down it's not gonna sit in there right and it's gonna rattle around possibly cause some damage so make sure you put it on this way around and make sure that you line this hub up this piece right here a rubber thing on it to keep it from rattling around and banging around and that's it it's very simple and easy to do and a very very good design too I might add thanks for watching ",

        "content": "hey everybody today I'm going to show you how to change your summer and winter tires how to swap them and for this you need a set of summer tires as you can see I have my rims with my tire there the summer ones and then a set of winter tires and if as you can see I have our winter rim a steely right there with a winter tire and you'll obviously have four of them I'm going to show you how to do one and you can just repeat the process for all four then you need a jack stand something to Jack the car up this is the one that came with my Honda Civic so any one will do and then you need basically a tire iris or something to take the bolts off of the tire just like that once again that's the one that came with my car so anything will do so I'm going to set this camera down and I will show you how to swap your summer and winter tires alright everyone here we go we're gonna start by jacking up the car so we're going to lift the car up off the ground now when you first do this you're not going to want to lift the car up off the ground to the point that the tire is completely lifted off the ground but just enough to elevate and you know open up the suspension there so that a little bit of pressure is alleviated so I'm going to take my jack stand I need to place it under the car in the appropriate squat you're going to want to confront your owner's manual for this but generally it should look like it's a thicker lighting on on the bottom of the car but definitely check your owners manual for where to place your jack stand so I'm going to place it under the car right now and we're going to crank the car up just like so now as you can see I'm just making sure that the tire is not lifted off the ground it should still be touching the ground and I'll show you why in one second so now that I've opened up the suspension a bit and the tires still touching it I'll do few cranks just to be sure there's not a lot of pressure tires still on the ground touching at the bottom making contact what are you do is I'm gonna take my entire iron just like this I don't even listen all of these bolts now you may have different a different number of bolts depending on what tire rim you have but you're going to take the tire iron you're going to loosen them now this might take a little bit of force so I'm going to stand up and just try and loosen them just like that just quarter of a turn just a little bit poor Durotan should be more than enough take it well you might have to pull really hard to loosen them but this will save you the trouble when the car is off the ground so to pull as hard as you can and slowly but surely you will get each of the bolts loose already now that that's done there's a tire iron inside I continued jacking up the car until the wheel is off the ground now that I loosened all the bolts alright so keep trying and keep jacking the car there are hydraulic jacks that will reduce a bit faster but this one came in my car so I'm going to free route and whenever possible keep going until that tire is significantly out of the ground jackin it up till you have a decent decent gap on maybe the holes cautious it plays my fingers underneath the tire just in case the car the jacks that fission car fills a wonky your fingers intact doesn't see that is quite a bit of space underneath now you know there's a decent amount of space underneath the tire so what I'm gonna do is I going to loosen these bolts and take them off completely so just like that and if you did loosen the bolts originally your tire will probably spin a little bit so you know it's a good thing that you loosen them from the beginning so take just tired I'm going to just spin the bolts until they come off like that there's one hook on to the next one I like to go I don't like doing a bolts one you know the ones that are next to each other just because I find that this is a much better method if you do that one they're next to each other it's sort of loosens and tightens the tire unevenly whereas if you go with like a almost an X pattern it will loosen and tighten the tire in an even you know evenly as much as possible at least so you take these off slowly but surely give your arms a little bit of a workout and then we're going to swap the rims and tires just take off this last one right here already now that you have all of the nuts taken off of the nuts over there you're gonna remove the rim and tire from the car now depending on your car how long the rim and tire been on the car its might be quite difficult you might have to give it to hammers to loosen it up just like that what should happen is the root and tire should come right off the car just like that and I'm gonna put this aside right over here I'm gonna go and get my winter driven fire over here just like that I'm gonna do face the opposite of what I just did with this rim entire regular so you know place the rim and tire on the bolts right there just like that make sure it's completely on then I'm gonna finger tighten all five of these just like that just finger tighten them for now and do it to the point where they're actually touching the rim so it holds it in place once again like I said I like doing it in a cross pattern an X pattern as opposed to the ones that are next to each other okay I go across as opposed to one two three four five tiny needs just like that then you're gonna get your tire iron and you're gonna really tightening them not to the point where they're insanely tight but just you know tame enough so that you can comfortably place the car down once again I go on a cross direction of pattern so I do that one and you do this one down here and this will evenly tighten satire it just really well aiming for that I do this one over here then I'll be listing right over here and then listen right over here and then once they're tight into that point do now that the tire is evenly tightened on there that was that point the point of that you're gonna take it we're gonna give it one really truly quick tighten all the way around just like that then you're going to lower the car not too far you'll or completely but like we did before we're a little bit of pressure is on the tire can I take a car and I'm going to lower it just this way just a little bit not all the way just a bit sweeter the point get some pressure you put on the tire and I can treat you put some force to tighten the bolts let's just go a few more prints over here you'll notice that you're using a jack like I am the one that came with the car lowering it is much easier than raising it up on your arms no need to use as much pressure so as you can see now there is pressure on the tire so why does I need to get my tire iron I'm going to really give it a lot of force the tech needs are here so I'm really going to crank it down as much as I can to truly get under stress get it as secure as I can on the vehicle just like that one final turn now that that's done continue lowering the car keep turning that jack or pumping it depending on what kind of Jackie pack I know this is tedious and boring but to the matter of fact is that they'll save you a little bit of money from bringing it into a mechanic shop or a dealership to pay for the tires to be changed and the registry changed let me Jack you a car and there you have it we've just changed one of the summer tires we just swapped one set of winter and summer rims and tires now basically do this and repeat this process for the other three rims and tires on the car and you will have swapped your rims and tires from summer to winter or winter to summer vice versa all by yourself and that's all I have for you today thanks for watching ",

        "original_title": "Change a Tire",
        "content": "ah in this installment what we're going to be covering is how to change a tire with the tools in your car I took the initiative and called the Ohio State Patrol on this just to find out what the safest way to do this is should you find yourself in a situation where you have a blowout on the highway most highly recommended course of action is to get off the highway completely you don't want to be doing this on the side of the road especially on a highway where people are traveling at a high rate of speed if you absolutely have to pull off the road what you want to do is get over as far to the right as possible first thing to do is to press your hazard switch that's usually located on the dashboard as a red triangle in addition to that you can purchase reflectors or road flares that you could put out just to alert other drivers that yes there is somebody with a disabled vehicle and don't hit them don't worry and if you have triple-a or you know really big boyfriend or then yeah by all means contact them and have them do it for you if you don't feel comfortable doing this but should you be in a situation where you absolutely have to do this then I would go about it this way another thing you want to consider before jacking up the vehicle is putting the parking brake on now normally spare tires are located in a trunk or in the case of this car they're located in the hatch we're usually located under some kind of access I'm going to open this one this is normally where you would find your spare tire these are the tools that you will need to work the jack and to get the wheel off we're going to pretend that this tire is flat now here's something else to note and that is that many times when you get your vehicle serviced check the air pressure not only in all of your tires but also in your spare tire unfortunately this rarely gets done so you may have to specially request this and in some cases you may have to pay a little more to have it done because should you ever need it and it doesn't have any air in it you're really just wasting your time one of the reasons why it doesn't get done all that often is because in order to fill this up you have to take it out of the car and you can do your technician a favor by taking all the stuff out of your trunk I can't tell you how many times somebody's asked me to check the air in their spare tire and they've got you know 100 pounds of topsoil back a golf clubs dirty clothes phone books ak-47s no that was an ar-15 sorry yeah all kinds of things in your trunk so you want to make sure that if you are having somebody perform this for you to remove your personal items from the trunk ahead of time that would be very helpful a lot of times they'll say run on the outside of the tire itself in this case it says inflate to 60 psi a lot of these instructions are also found in your owner's manuals and also a list of warnings here on this car the jack is kind of in a goofy place but I'm going to show you how to get it out of here it's located in the back here over by where the tire was and what you can do is look for the side with the adjuster for this and then just twist it and this should bring it down to the foyer you can take it out now that you have the tire out of the vehicle what you need to do is you need to get the damaged tire off of the car get your lug wrench out and this little guy you'll need this too the next thing you need to do is loosen the lug nuts you don't want to jack the car up first thing you want to loosen the lug nuts if you Jack this wheel up ahead of time here I'll show you what happened that's not gonna help you so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to try to take the lug nuts off now this seems rudimentary to say in order to loosen things you turn them counterclockwise in order to tighten things you turn them clockwise these lug nuts may be on very very tight so you may not be able to get these loose like this in fact it's not very likely that you will so there's one of two methods that I'm going to show you our first method is to stand on that's method one now you may not have the weight to overcome this so I'm going to show you something that if you're very careful about doing you can do this but if you're in a pinch you can use the weight of the car on the lug wrench and your jack now what you want to do is position the jack in such a way it's going to come in contact with the bottom of the lug wrench like this try to make sure that this fits in this little notch right here and what that's going to do in effect is use the weight of the car to overcome how tight and lug nut is now if you wonder what this little hooky thing is for see how this is getting towards the end keep an eye here to make sure this doesn't come flying off it may get violent but that is that is an alternative method using no strength but gravity to loosen a lug nut you may have to try this more than once because you're going to need to get it in just the right position in order for this to work I'm going to loosen the rest of these in the conventional foot method now that you have all the lug nuts loose it's time to Jack the car up now there's a couple of points on cars modern modern cars usually seem to have these points and some vehicles actually have arrows pointing to these areas and there's also diagrams in some cases that show you where the jack points are for the car in this case you see this reinforced area right here right here is another area what you want to do is position a jack under this area so that this knotch fits right under this so it kind of cradles itself in there this is called the scissor jack usually a good way to get these offices to give them a little a little hit but sometimes wheels get stuck on the hubs and sometimes you have to kick them pretty hard if you're unable to get the wheel off the car which does happen sometimes particularly with the aluminum wheels what you can do is you can put the lug nuts back on but don't tighten them all the way leave them a little bit loose drive the car for a few feet or whatever you have to do and a lot of times the weight of the car will break them loose these scissor jacks can be very precarious you want to be very careful not to knock the car off the jack because if you do it will hurt you pretty bad and you don't want a bad situation to get worse but the next step is to put the wheel on okay now that you have the new tire on you want to let the weight of the vehicle off the jack so you want to bring the jack down again okay now that you've got the vehicle back down on the ground and it's solid you want to tighten the lug nuts one final time tighten in a clockwise direction you don't need to tighten these things so much that you're never going to be able to get the wheel off again just make them snug you've got enough leverage with with the lug wrench that it should be okay now that you have your spare tire mounted and take the other tire and put in your trunk is probably the most logical place to put it I hope this helps you should you be stranded with a flat tire at some time just the bullet points get off the highway if it's at all possible drive it off the highway loosen lug nuts before you jack the car up tighten lug nuts after you let the car down using the jack to possibly lose some lug nuts if you need to don't drive around for an extended period of time on these spares they're not designed to be tires they're designed to get you someplace to where you can either get your tire repaired or replaced but I hope that this bit of information was helpful to you if you have any questions or comments leave them down here or you can visit me at eric the car guy comm thank you have a great day yeah this is gonna be fun you might just learn something ",
