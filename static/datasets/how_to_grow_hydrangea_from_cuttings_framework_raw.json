        "content": "hey guys so I just got back from our family trip to Oregon this summer and we had a lot of fun but it was time to come home and on our way home we stopped by this really awesome nursery they had a lot of really neat stuff there being over on the Oregon coast it's just cool and in fact it is hotter than heck after coming inland more and being back home but it's just real cool and breezy over there is probably like 60 70 degrees with the Sun beatin down but just nice and cool so everything is just so much more lush and green over there this nursery anyway was really awesome and while I was there they had a hydrangea that was just blooming with the most beautiful deep blue flowers and I have been trying to figure out hydrangea for awhile never have been able to so I just asked them if they would let me take some cuttings and they said sure you know I offered to pay they didn't want any money and this was a nursery they just had its growing in the ground I took a whole bunch of cuttings from their nursery and we'll go ahead and stick these guys and see if they take and that way I'll know when they finally do start blooming whether it's the actual hydrangea or whether it's me and what I'm doing to the soil now I've heard you know you've got to have the right acidity in the soil to make them blue but I think genetics play some part in it so we're gonna find out well propagate these show you how we do that and we'll see you know knowing that these were actually I saw the flowers with my own eyes they are deep deep blue really beautiful and we'll find out once and for all is it mirrors at the flower and then we'll come back and see how things are rootin in a couple months so let's go ahead and see see these things getting potted up alright so here's my potting bench we've got everything I think that we're gonna need for this and let's see here we've got a few 4-inch four-and-a-half inch pots we've got the hydrangea cuttings that we're gonna kind of Whittle down here and then we've got form it in 3 this is the rooting hormone I like to use for just about anything I've used dip and grow and other are other forms of routing medium in the past but I really liked that hormone in three because I do roadie cutting so much and they really need more a stronger hormone so there's my little diddler actually it's just a stick I just found but it'll work and then pruning shears we need and so let's go ahead and get started and I don't know if I showed this in a video before but I like to use these alcohol swabs you can get in any drugstore to just wipe down the pruning shears first so they're clean from whatever you were doing last time so when I take any cuttings especially cuttings like like these these are more softwood cuttings I know it's we're in the middle of August you could call them semi hardwood maybe but it's such succulent growth that I don't know you could almost call it softwood maybe somewhere between softwood and semi hardwood but I will go ahead and just take off a couple of these leaves here and then clip it down and when I when I take the cutting I like to take it right below a leaf node so you saw those leaves were right there coming out of there and I pulled them off and just cut right below the node because there's a higher concentration of differentiating cells in those nodes that can actually then go and form roots and then just like rodia's will strip the excess leaves off of these guys and then take just a little sliver little sliver from the bark here to get down to that cambium layer so that these things can root a little bit easier and then of course we'll cut these leaves down by half maybe just to prevent excess moisture loss so there's our cutting and we've got a rooting hormone here and go ahead and swirl that around in there tap off the excess and there you have it all covered up with rooting hormone that's just a real nice cutting and should form some awesome roots stick it in the pot actually get the diddler just get our $5000 diddler here and I don't do that for roadies but for these I softer plants I'd do that cuz I don't want to damage the stem and bend it break it anything like that well pack down that rooting medium which is actually just the same fine bark that I use our medium bar well not medium probably more fine bar that I use for the roadies and then that's all you have so I'm gonna go ahead and finish all these guys up and then I'll show you what they look like all right so it's actually the next day August 18th I ended up having to wait another day because the I wanted to propagate a few other plants that need to get watered well and just needed to soak in some water into the plant and just really hydrate well before I took the cuttings so I waited today anyway this is what I ended up using now definitely not a large scale propagation bed here but for just odds and ends and little cuttings of plants that I like you know I like to grow other plants besides roadies and so occasionally I like to take cuttings and just do things you know just grow on a few other different varieties so in here I ended up decided I did all hydrangeas that I'd showed you I labeled I'm not sure the varieties of a couple of them because I just was able to get those cuttings at the nursery and that it had been growing there for a long time they didn't even know the particularly and then one of them was just wild I found off of the side of the road there leading down to a beach called hug point on the Oregon coast so I just labeled them hug point and this one here is glowing glowing embers that's a variety that I bought that's the real deep pink that I really like and then this is that blue one right here I just label them blue because once again we don't know the variety but they're going all the way back here down all these rows so and then I went ahead and did some white gel I really liked variegated white jealous so I did a bunch of those cuttings I think I've got was at four five ten eleven twelve thirteen cuttings total and you know they'll do perfect in those little pots they don't need anything big you could actually probably put more cuttings in one of those little pots but I just took thirteen that was what was easily accessible on the plant and then some Java red Y jela the Java Reds are real pretty variety too and they go well with the variegated but so that's all I've done right now I could definitely fit more in here if I want to just fill the whole bottom with the bark that would work out too but I just you know wanted to do individual pots so I could pull them out and put them in the in the hoop house when they started rooting on so these little totes I mean this makes it super easy I found this if I think Walmart for like 15 bucks and it's even got a foam lining along here that when clamped down it just seals it up and keeps all the moisture in and that works out great for cutting so the latest clear stuff can let light through I've definitely got all of this on the back side of my barn or you know you could put on the backside of any building the north side so that the sun's not hitting it directly you want lots of overhead light which right here I have plenty of overhead light between these two buildings and it ends up protecting from the Sun really well the Sun never will hit this except for maybe if that may be 15 minutes and the evening just right up between those trees and the roof of the barn so I'm not too worried about that at all but I might even move it behind the house but this works out really well like I said like 15 bucks and you can't go wrong you just pot up your cuttings put them in this little tote seal it up it's the summertime we've got plenty of four months to go at least in Washington we usually have Indian summers and so we have plenty of Sun and warmth up through October so I'm not worried about bottom heat at all for these guys they'll they'll root on just fine especially the varieties that I have in there the white jello really take off soon so we'll come back and we'll check this out in I don't know probably two months and we'll see where things are at I'll let you see how well they rooted on all right well it's been about a month since well a little over a month since I took these cuttings of these hydrangea and why Gela let's see what we've got locks down on this lid I love this little propagation box and how it turned out is just been really cool I love out seals up everything stayed real humid in there alright so we've got the cuttings here it's been I think it was August eighteenth or nineteenth when we did that last little clip of video and you saw that when I said when I took these cuttings but we're what is it September I think 26 or seventh now so you know a little over a month like five weeks and I pop this box open and look down in here look at what I saw this is absolutely crazy because there's so much humidity in here these roots are just growing right into the air you can see them growing down into the soil there too these are that hug point rhododendron i need them hug point because that's where I got em Huck Point Oregon they're just grown wild on the side of the road but anyway those things are just rooting like crazy so let's uh let's see how are we gonna do this let's take one of these out and see what we get how this is gonna work I'm gonna try and tip this guy upside down yeah nothing going through all the way there but let's see maybe we can peel some of that back and just kind of pull it out tease it out yeah look at those roots all right there we go all right so you can see I think all of these roots here growing out through that little hydrangea I mean that's the whole root ball right there you can see the root little roots coming out through the end there anyway I mean we're talking five weeks and this isn't even springtime this is in the late summer so I don't think it really tell matters when you take these cuttings something else I want to show you already kind of looked in this box and I was looking at the white gellick because I know those really really quickly you put these guys back those white gelly root really really quickly so I pulled them out I took a look at them already and they have got a massive roots growing in here let's see here I can do this again and they're just growing like crazy five weeks variegated white Gela taken in the middle of August anyway I'm gonna have to pop them suckers up or they're gonna take over get all intertwine there become a real problem so if you're ever interested in propagating hydrangea or why Gela I've got variegated white Gela and java red white gel in there's several different types of hydrangea they all rooted these guys are in here really firm I'm excited about that that's that blue variety I was telling you about so if you're ever interested in that that's all we did we just used some some fine pine or fir bark and a tote that I bought at Walmart and then just a bunch of little four or they four and a half inch pots and just potted them up nothing special water dam in real good and five weeks later there we are I you know I used some rooting hormone that I showed you but other than add there's nothing special here so hope you guys can take that and make something happen and have an awesome day all right adios ",

        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "okay so today you in the polytunnel with dan and as you know I'm very much into container growing at the moment I want to help people grow things in containers and some absolutely fantastic stuff can be grown within containers because many people think because they don't have a large garden or indeed maybe just have a small courtyard garden or even just a balcony you can grow some great stuff in some containers and I thought I'd show you some of the things that I'm going to do so we'll start off with this here now this is a hydrangea and I was given this plant last year and for whatever reason it just ended up in this small pot now it survived the winter and it did very well last summer and you can see these lovely healthy new shoots coming here now I love hydrangeas and I have these beautiful large flowers absolutely lovely they are and they really can brighten up a garden and now you can have them in the ground you can have them on a patio and you know just have them sitting on a balcony if that's all you have so absolutely lovely things to do and they do require a lot of water but you can supply that even if it's growing within a pot so I'll show you the growing medium that I'm going to use now what I'm going to do is use some ingredients that are relatively easy for everybody to source so let's have a look around here what we've got so down here I've got some vegetable growing compost which you know relatively fibrous and it's nutritious as well I've got some normal garden soil down here just dug this up out of the garden now if you don't have a garden maybe you can find someone who would kindly give you some soil maybe you could just go and a friend and say can I have a bucket of soil I'm sure someone would give you some soil and here this is basic multi-purpose compost that I use for seeds etc etc starting seeds so I like to mix these up together in different concoctions so to speak and here now you may or may not be able to get hold of this but what this is is this is wood ash from say a wood burner or a fire open fire or from a bonfire so you can get hold of some of that even better so what I'm going to do is start off at the bottom now with regards to growing hydrangeas in containers what you want is you want the biggest container possible you want around you don't really want any less steep than 18 inches but of course if you can't get a pot that size or for whatever reason you can't afford one or whatever you know use any pot as you can see this one here has done well in this pot here and what I always say it's better to grow something in a small pot than to not grow anything at all but so I find these are very good these buckets here and one thing I like about them very much is the fact that you've got the handles like this because if you're going to be moving these around which you more or likely will be doing with regards to pots you want something relatively easy to to lift now what I'm going to do is show you what I'm going to put in down here but first some people like to put drainage stones at the bottom for a little bit of drainage to help the water leave the bottom of the pot but so I'm not going to do that the reason why I'm not going to do that is maybe because some of you out there have not got access to stones maybe you live in the middle of a city and therefore getting stones is difficult I know it sounds silly but that may be the case so if you want you can put maybe an inch or two of pebbles at the bottom so what I'm going to do first is start off with adding some of this garden soil now it's relatively heavy and I will be using garden soil it's simply because it can help to reduce your bills a bit if you can get some for free and when you're growing hydrangeas in containers which is very very fascinating subject indeed because with regards to the pH you can help to adjust the color of your flowers what they're going to be absolutely amazing it's a large area of study itself but on average you want to have around the pH of six to seven but later videos I might do a video on how to get different colors from your flowers on hydrangeas and its really worth studying because you can get magnificent colors with hydrangeas beautiful blues pinks purples etc and whites and you really do want to be looking into the so what we've got here at the bottom is a little bit of garden so there I'm just gonna break it up a little bit using the old sphere and Jackson trowel and what I'm going to put in next is some of the vegetable growing medium now the vegetable growing medium it's a bit more expensive than the regular potting compost or the multi-purpose compost but what you will feel is you will feel the weight of it just the weight of these buckets the vegetable compost versus the multi-purpose compost the vegetable compost is much heavier indeed and that's because it contains extra nutrients that these plants will need because growing things in containers of course the plant has to get all of its nutrients from what's within the container so I think it's very important to make sure you put enough nutrients in it in order to sustain the plant for a decent amount of time because if you don't do that you know your plant it won't rewards you with a lovely lush growth so certainly you want to be working on making sure your growing medium is very nutritious so just putting that in there like that and I'm making sure it's spread now my reasoning for putting the garden soil at the bottom is because it's likely that the garden soil has got seeds in it from weeds some of which and grass etc that you won't be able to see so at the bottom there they're less likely to be able to grow up and of course the vegetable compost and the potting compost have been treated so therefore they don't contain seeds you don't want weeds all coming up all over your the wind like that good grief so yeah with regards to and you know want weeds growing up all over your all over your lovely plants etc a degree of weeds is inevitable of course it is but you want to keep it to a minimum that's my opinion anyway so yeah so I'm going to continue putting a bit more of this in here like this very nice to work with this actually and one thing that you can I like to consider when I'm repotting is in many cases it doesn't matter but I don't like to use stone cold compost to spin outside I like to leave it now I'm gonna share or something for a few days before or indeed in this polytunnel which getting quite warm actually the last few days made about daytime temperatures of about 10 degrees say 12 degrees say so very good in day considering them the cold weather litter we have head of light so you know in there right and what we're going to do now is put in a little bit of the regular potting compost like so okay so this is the hydrangea here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to just gently take this out in order to make sure that's it that's about perfect they're sitting like that and I'd like to just have a nice look at it like that nice nice feeling that's a good size and what I'm going to do is just push that down in here like this now there's a little trick that you can do if you want so we'll just put that there's no promise got a nice establish route now I've got a little bit of water here and this water has been sitting in this polytunnel for the last 24 hours and again with this plan it's not such an issue but I don't like to shock plants using to cold water I just think it's nice so probably always put a bit of water in there but it's good to give plugs a nice start when you are repotting them that's what I think and what I've done is last night I watered this so this is relatively moist and from water from play water in here so what I'm going to do is put that in there like that now that looks absolutely lovely doesn't it and I'm going to proceed to simply fill it up with the bottom compost like this see these weeds that you can take them out as well if you wish if you want to firm it down you don't want any air pockets really has got a lovely established root ball on that common where the person said that this came from I think they said it came from one of them bargain shops and ooh that's one important thing because a lot of people have got the idea that gardening is expensive because they've got the wrong idea that went to places where the products know nine times out of ten are very good quality but they are classed as expensive by people but doesn't have to be and you can take hydrangeas from cuttings and this may be I think I might going to later in the year but when you're gardening you can you want to find ways of being resourceful because this in my opinion it's absolutely beautiful when you see gardens and small green spaces in areas that you just don't expect them and I remember a long time ago seeing someone on the internet I didn't I read it in a garden magazine and what he'd done is he had been growing things on his balcony absolutely amazing and just the amount of produce that he he was managing to get from there are tomatoes him window boxes and her so much that you can do so they want to be covering too much of the bottom here that's gonna absolutely gorgeous just like that we're gonna get a bit more and you see I'm using a lot of the multi-purpose compost for this because you know it tends to be the cheapest and with regards to where you can get multi-purpose compost from so many places now so you got the obvious ones you've got B&amp;Q you've got home base here in the UK I'm sure if you're viewing this video in the US you've got your own versions of those is it home depot they call it but even here in the UK some of the budget places are selling compost now get them in coops barn from garden centers look on the internet probably even get it delivered straight to your door so ya really can look to open up the world of gardening for yourself because really is worth getting into in my opinion so yeah look at that look nice just gonna make sure take the bit to the compost away I mentioned earlier about with regards to ph's of the ground medium for hydrangeas and it's a big subject and as a beginner it might not be one that you know we should broach right now but it's worth getting into once you've got your plant established if you want to have a go with different colors and wood ash can be one of those things that you can use to make your soul more alkaline and the alkalinity of the soil can determine the color of your eventual flowers but as I stated before if we go between 6 &amp; 7 at the moment but again if all that science worries you you don't even need to worry too much about that to be honest you can just follow the guidance that I've done here and the wood ash isn't necessary I'm just using it because it's from the wood burner and I'm using it up but yeah nice simple approach to get you going and I think this would be absolutely beautiful what I'm gonna do you just give it I know I watered it in the hole earlier on but I'm just going to give it just obviously a watering can would be good for that but it's in the bucket now so yeah there we go that is a video I've got for you for growing hydrangeas in containers I hope you enjoyed that and I'll see you soon ",

        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "welcome to Hort tube my name is Jim Putnam and this is a limelight hydrangea [Music] this is the beautiful lime green and white flowering limelight hydrangea limelight hydrangea is a hydrangea paniculata which are sometimes referred to as tree hydrangeas and you can see behind me that this one is maybe 14 feet right now so they get quite large they're listed on a lot of websites to 6 to 8 feet in height and that's probably true that you can keep them in that height range but if you let it go over time it's going to become a small tree hydrangea paniculata is including limelight are extremely cold hardy these things grow in the vast majority of the United States they'll grow all the way up to zone 3 and down to zone 9 limelight is very fast growing once it's established it will probably put on 2 perhaps even three feet of growth in a single season before it flowers in the summer unlike the big leaf hydrangeas hydrangea paniculata czar definitely Sun loving plants I've got these two limelight hydrangeas planted an absolute full Sun they bake from early in the morning until late in the evening lamb light could be pruned into a small tree on the corner of your foundation I don't think you'd probably want this plant along your foundation it would end up covering up the windows you'd have to do so much pruning on it it wouldn't flower very much you'd constantly be pruning the flower buds off lime light makes a fantastic border plant and I think that's really the best use for this plant I've used these two for that purpose right here this has created a nice wind barrier and even when they lose their leaves in the winter time they're actually still quite thick so the main features of limelight hydrangeas is they start off with these lime green flowers which over time become very very bright white and it creates a two-tone color across the plant these right here I don't know if you're going to see that directly in here these have been tree formed and are now in the twelve to fourteen foot range it can be pruned off from the top in the wintertime these could probably be cut in half and be kept as a much smaller shrub these bloom on new growth which i think is fantastic because you can prune them in the winter time the other thing about them blooming on new grow is I can go in here and break off some of these flowers and I likely have enough time for this branch to actually give me two new branches and flower again before the end of summer I've included videos in the description of this video for planting woody trees and shrubs you're really just not going to have a problem with limelight as long as you don't put it in an area that's going to stay wet all the time or mound the mulch up on the base of them over time that could be an issue super easy plant just follow some basic best practices planting instructions and you should be fine hydrangea paniculata is as a group are very drought tolerant once they're rooted into the ground but with that said this thing's in full bloom in early to mid summer and if it wasn't getting some additional water when it was in full bloom it would almost certainly start to lose some leaves you'd see a lot of yellow leaves on this it'd be shedding the flowers would be much smaller perhaps so during that period of time in late spring or early summer if your area becomes dry you'll want to drag a water hose over to these and give them some extra water I fertilize these lime lights in the late winter right before they started to wake up with just a slow-release fertilizer it's about midsummer now and it should be running out it was a fertilizer that last three to four months that's kind of ideal I want the fertilizer running out by midsummer so they can start to wind down and go dormant naturally lime light could be pruned pretty much any time you would need to prune it I don't think you would hurt it probably the best time to do severe pruning on it would be in the late winter or early spring before it starts to wake up the nice thing about hydrangea paniculata is they bloom on new growth and not on old growth like the other varieties of hydrangeas so you can prune these in the winter time and still have flowers you can't do that on hydrangea macrophylla Zoar the big leaf hydrangeas that you can do some additional pruning pruning on it during the season and after these blooms start to fade in midsummer in my area I could actually take these off and I probably have enough time for this thing to flush back out and bloom one additional time in September or October in my area we really don't see a lot of pests on limelight hydrangeas there's a little leaf spot on this and I could find a few places where some things have chewed on it just not that big of a deal it seems to resist most of those types of problems it would be susceptible to root rot if you put it in an area that just stayed wet all the time I think that would not be advisable hydrangea paniculata are definitely more deer resistant than big leaf hydrangeas big leaf hydrangeas they'll absolutely eat them to the ground they tend to stay away from these a little more but if deer are a big concern for you you might only plant one of these and just see how it goes before you put a lot of them in at one time so what are you waiting for even you can grow the stunningly beautiful very long flowering limelight hydrangea thank you for watching my video and if it was helpful please hit the like button and subscribe to my channel for future videos also
