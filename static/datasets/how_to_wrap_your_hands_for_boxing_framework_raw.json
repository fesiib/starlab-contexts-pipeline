        "category": "Sports and Fitness",
        "content": "[Music] hey everybody today we're going to be doing a video on how to properly wrap your hands most of you guys out there you know if your fighters boxing or MMA it's always good to protect your hands make sure you're wrapping them before you do any type of bag wordpad work any sparring especially and if you're just a trainer working with a client you know and if you're gonna do something with mitts you always want to protect your clients hands especially if someone who's you know the condition and they're throwing a punch in their life you want to make sure they're very well protected so we're going to do a video today I'm just how to wrap it now what I use are these wraps you know they're made out of cloth you can wash them they're reusable you can get them anywhere like animal del Sports Authority or you can go online to any you know any website that would sell boxing equipment or anything like that I really like these now they also have the ones that are pre-made where you're gonna do is kind of do like a glove you just slip your hand in and you know those are fine as well but these are a lot more these are a lot less expensive so what you want to do is first we're gonna do is you're gonna take this and you're gonna fold it now you want it to look like this before you start wrapping your hands basically so what you do to get it like this you take it from the velcro side and you fold it and you start rolling it up and you want it so that while you're rolling it up the velcro is on top you don't want it with the buckram on the bottom and you'll see why at the end of the video but you want to look this you're just going to roll it up like this I'll tell you they like this all right now once you get it like this what I like to do is you know whenever I watch my to have a lot so I'll roll them all up and I'll take the little loop for your thumb and I'll just put it around the wrap like this and though pretty much just a like this so they're easier to store like that you can throw them in your bag that won't come on tangled and they'll be ready to go now what you want to do to get started once you've got this what you're gonna do is you're going to take the little loop that's for your thumb you're going to put it through your thumb obviously and you're going to go around your wrist twice now when you go the first thing you need to do is very important to start it the right way the side that has the stitching wear underneath it looks ugly you want to get you want to put that on the bottom the ugly stitching always goes on bottom so that it looks nice on top nice and smooth on top right and that's also very important you won't loose ey at the end the best way to do it is if you look at the rap it looks like this the whole time where the like the big roll is underneath not on top if you do like that then the ugly stitching will be on top and this if you wrapped your hands like this the whole time it's going to be wrong in the end so you always want to make sure that your app looks like this while you're rapping okay so you start take your hand always make sure you leave your hands open like this you don't want them close at any moment because if you wrap you want to do it a little tight so if your hands like this you're not gonna be able to open them they're gonna get a little you're gonna cut off a little bit of the circulation to your hand alright so you want to avoid that so we're gonna do it you're going to like this keep your hand open all tight all times you're gonna wrap around your wrist twice one two right now when you're here remember keep your hands open you're wrapping it the right way the roll is on the bottom after the second time you're gonna come under your wrist and you're gonna go over your thumb like this underneath it and then back around on top okay just like that that's the first step once you get to here you're going to come back on there you're gonna go across your hand to your pinky side but where your knuckles are you're gonna go under there three times that's one two and three notice I'm keeping my hands open the whole time alright so once you get to here you're going to come underneath and if you see this little opening I'm gonna come underneath I'm gonna come back down across on my pinky side to my wrist and I'm gonna close that little opening with the wrap so right now my hand is pretty much all wrapped right on the top the bottom should stay like this the whole time if we see this opening this opening should be there when you're done as well okay do you go over and if you notice I went across the one's the first time now that I'm coming back down with the opposite way so I'm making like an X which is what you want to do when you're wrapping your hands you want to make that X constantly so went across here now I'm going back the other way and I made my eggs covered my head and now I'm here again okay I'm under my wrist now what I'm gonna do from here is I'm gonna go in between each one of my fingers but it's when you go between this one it's not the same as when you're going between here and you'll see the difference I'm gonna come over I'm gonna go in between my fingers now I'm gonna take the wrap and go under my hand towards my thumb side okay come back over my knuckles once for a little protection and then you come back across and if you see I made another X right now ii know when you're going between here we want to do is you come under your wrist again you're gonna come up you're going to go in between and instead of going to your thumb like you've been doing going in this direction you're going to go towards your pinky alright and now from here on you're going to be going the opposite direction so the whole time we've been wrapping our hands like this now it's going to be the opposite way okay so go on there one more time across the knuckle if you see it sort of clump up like this you just want to fix it make sure it's a flat okay as flat as you can right here and go always every time you go over and in between your finger when you go under you come across the knuckles once okay just like that come on there now we're gonna go across to make our X okay go back under the race we finish off the last space that we have come here back towards the pinky because now this is the direction we're going over the knuckles once and when you get to this point once you've got in between all the spaces you wrapped it twice in the beginning you've wrapped over here once you get to this point you basically do whatever you need me personally I my knuckles are pretty big and a lot of times if I don't wrap over my knuckles you know a little more than with the rest of this it'll hurt when I throw which is especially during sparring so you know if if you're like me you know you wanted to take a lot of the wrapping just go back oh you know go over here other guys might like to go around their thumb one more time maybe finish to ourself on the wrist it just depends but the important thing is to get to this point where you've gotten in between all your fingers make sure the rest of it is all correct and then from here you just do whatever you like so just to finish it what I would do with maybe a client or one of my fighters I'll go over the knuckles a few more times come back down across go under go over do my thumb again okay come on there now I have a little bit more so maybe I'll come up and do the knuckle one more time but if you see like I'm running out of space so maybe it's not such a good idea but I can probably squeeze it in just here maybe not all the way around but at least come under it and now I'm here now remember in the beginning when I told you you wanted to grab it the right way because at the end if you kept it the right way the whole time at the end the velcro should be on top so it just finishes off nice and easy if you would have done it the other way when you finished the velcro beyond the bottom and then you got to do this like fold unless you want to wrap your hands all over again but you know you could just fold like fold the rack like that and it would be fixed you know so just you know just to avoid that all together okay I don't really like this so I'm gonna just finish the rest on my wrist now what you want to do when you get to about this much you can fill it it's probably just better to finish it on your wrist what you want to do from here to finish it off you're gonna make a fist okay make a fist keep your hand really tight and then you're going to wrap the rest around your wrist now you don't want to make it too tight to cut off circulation but you want to make it tight enough keep that fist tight close it off now remember in the beginning I said you should still have this space here the top should look good like this I want to between all my fingers so you want to just maybe take your fingers and push them in here just sure you're good what I like to do at the end just to make it like I'm grabbing something I'll take the rest this wrap here and I'll kind of tuck it under like this and it kind of makes something that I grab I like to do that a lot it just feels more comfortable when it's in the glove and when I'm shadowboxing and things like that so you want to do this and you have your open space make sure nice and tight and make sure that it's not cutting off any circulation it shouldn't hurt it should just feel nice and comfortable what a lot of guys might do sometimes what I do even I'll take like some box some tape athletic tape and you know you wrap it around your knuckle maybe around your thumb once and then you know around the wrist a few times make an ax here and then wrap it you know just for a little extra protection but if you do just this you should be fine all right so I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope to help you out if you know anybody out there we did not have love wrap their hands please try it you know comment on the video let me know what you think and like us on Facebook thanks for watching [Music] ",

        "content": "[Music] hello welcome to filter box channel and today I'm gonna do a how-to of how to do your hand wraps now there is loads of different ways that you can do your hand wraps if you look on YouTube and on the internet you will see all the different preferred ways of different people I did do a hand wrap video before which was with my white winning hand wraps and also the gel pad so I'm going to do a different one to that because since I've changed doing it so what happens is as you start to see all the people do their hand wraps as you watch different things you'll find that different things work for your hands so this is not a right this is the best hand wraps for everyone ever and because I don't think that that exists because people do have preferences different parts of their hand that they need more protection on so this is a fairly standard right way to do some hand wraps and the way that I currently feel is best for me so I'm going to share it with yourselves and see what you think and these are the sort of videos that gets the most sort of people thinking oh no no I wouldn't do that I don't do that and as I say it's not about me saying this is the only way because it's not the only way there are lots and lots of different ways so just if you can take something from this video then that is fantastic and some of the things that I do you might think oh that's a good idea and you might incorporate them in your existing hand wrapping routine so what I've done is I've tried to break it down into ten steps and so I will show you those ten steps if you get your hand wrap and if you wrap them into the ball into the actual roll with that outside then that will mean that the loop up beyond the outside that means you can hold onto the actual roll as you're going through and what I've found is I just find that a little bit neater to do than what I used to do which was to do with the actual roll was all extended out so my first step I've got ten steps to it my first step is the step across there which goes over the back of the actual thumb and as you can see it's facing down that's the way that it faces down not not that way you actually faces down that way so then I'll come around side step one is there step two I do once around the wrist and that is fairly fairly firm okay step three I go round the back of the thumb okay and then I'll come up across and as you can see I've gone higher up the back of my hand okay that's step three step four I go from the base of my hand of the thumb to the pinky finger the little finger and I come across the front nice play my hands like so and then I come to the fore finger and I do that cross motion so you can see there there's a cross that goes from the base of the thumb up to the pinky finger over the hound the base of the hand to the forefinger and then you've got the cross that comes right to the back here of this wrist okay so that's step four Step five from the base of the thumb take it through in between the pinky finger and the ring finger and then I come here like so and then i retrace over that cross motion so I'm back to there so what I've done is I've done the one in between the finger then the next stage is the middle finger so again from the base through the middle finger I'll bring you to the fore finger so you can see what I've done there and then again I retrace that cross over the back of the hand and I'm back to that base position again at the base of the thumb I've now got two of the gaps have got the actual rappy going through the fingers and then now for step 7 I go from the base up through that finger there but this time would take it the other way so I actually take it instead of on the inside and take it to the outside so if we bring that round so I bring that round there so I'll just show you there that comes around to there and then I'm in that position there so I've gone through there then I can wrap it round so I get as flat as possible then I can wrap it round the knuckles because we haven't really covered the knuckles yet so I'll wrap it round up knuckles keep your hand splayed once twice three times okay so that's step 8 and then step 9 we go we wrap it round that rip that thumb again and wrap it round to the wrist okay which is step 10 under that there and you can go down the wrist a little bit lower okay so you've got good wrist support and then the final thing if you want to do at the end is pinch pinch there to create that bar so that's all clear and then also just pinch fold that under and that enables you you've got cover on the knuckles it's gone through to the fingers you've got a couple of times that has gone around the thumb to protect thumb you've got that crisscross motion that we've used the whole way through you start it off on the wrist and you finished on the wrist and that means that you've now got a very nice comfortable wrap that there means you can pull a good fist as a slides into the glove okay so you've got too much on the palm of the hand so hope you enjoyed that that's my sort of current take on doing some standard hammer ups sort of the best way to put them on and I will be doing a video very very soon with the winning and the gel pads because I have improved how I did that first video so I want to share that with you as well okay hope you enjoyed that please like and subscribe to fit to box channel and I shall speak to you soon thank you [Music] ",

        "category": "Sports and Fitness",
        "content": "everybody so I'm here today to show you guys how to wrap your hands with smaller wraps I've previously done a how to wrap your hands video that's pretty popular on YouTube and it's uh it's done with 180 inch wrap now the problem that is a lot of people were complaining that the rest that they use aren't as long as the ones that I use so the way the way that I like to wrap my hands with the long wrap doesn't necessarily always work with the shorter wrap so I'm going to just assume that people are using 120 inch which is usually like a standard that you would find in like a model Sports Authority any type of sporting goods stores that's like a standard alright now I'm going to use the maximum a raft because they have the 120 inch and they also have Arjun 30-inch one so I'm going to just show you that this is the previous wrap that they had before and these are basically they have a slight elasticity they're 120 inch they're very nice I did a I did a video where you guys saw my boxing coach right from my hands with them they feel really awesome I really do like these racks if you want to wrap your hands quicker you don't to waste the time going to the one that I showed before and that would be a good one for you to use these are some of the other reps that they sent us now these are made this one in particular and this zebra one are made with bamboo fibers so they're not as elastic so they're kind of like really stiff almost like as if you were to get like a time wrap but because of the bamboo fiber they're actually a lot softer it feels pretty nice it's just because of the Li says it might be a little loose on your hand you'll see that when I wrap my hands and this other one that they sent me I haven't really seen them on their site to be honest with you I don't know if this is like a new perhaps they're coming out with but I'm very happy that accepted me because this rack is really awesome you guys can see it's really elastic and it's I don't know if you can tell that there's like you can see that you can almost clay see through it so it's very breathable like the way they've done it it almost looks like a mesh type of weaving and then it's like it's because it's so elastic like I've actually wrapped my hands with it already and they feel really awesome and because of the weaving it's very breathable on your hand so like your hands you know when your hands get really sweaty on the inside of the glove stuff like that um it would come in handy now depending on it doesn't really matter how you what gloves you wear okay you still always want to wrap your hands to be protected you know I would recommend that you know if you're using the box of gloves or any of the gloves that kind of just slip on like these even especially these bag gloves because they're a little thinner you may want to get the longer wraps just for the extra padding and protection you may want to even wrap your hands the way that I've done in the previous video when you have these big gloves you can get away with 120 inch and they will still be protected because the glove has so much padding when you're going to wrap your hands up for an MMA glove you want the smaller wrap you definitely want the hundred-twenty it you don't want to use a 80 because depending on the glove you know it might not fit your hand very comfortably if the padded might just be a little too thick on them on your knuckles so I would always recommend over 20 inch with the glove and the style that I'm going to show you how to wrap today is going to be really good for that I mean gloves so let's get started alright so the first one I'm going to use is the bamboo fiber one so it's again it's the one that's not really lastly you can even hear it it's a little stiffer so I'm going to wrap my left hand with this I'm going to wrap my hands up the same way on both hands I'm going to wrap them the exact same style so you just see so that you can see the difference okay so first thing you're going to do is you're going to start you're going to put the loop you always see that on the wraps there's one side that's like an ugly side and one side that's a nice side okay the nice side is always on top all right well usually that's how it always goes so here I'm going to start you're going to put it through put it through the thumb loop I'm going to go across my wrist I'm going to go around my wrist ah let's go twice we always want to go around the wrist twice for the support I like to start with the support because at the end I don't really have to worry about it and then we're going to go over the thumb one so once I go over twice I'm going to come underneath my wrist go around my thumb like this and make sure it's comfortable you don't play with it a little bit make sure it feels comfortable on your thumb and then you're going to go back over the wrist like this okay make sure that your wrap doesn't get like too scrunched up like that so now I'm here okay once I'm here what I'm going to do is I'm going to come up I'm going to go around my knuckles I'm going to keep my hands open like this never like this because if I wrap like this too tight that might can't really open my fingers gonna be really tight on my hands uncomfortable so I'm going to come across I'm going to try to make an X I'm going to show you what I'm going to do I'm going to wrap around my knuckle once come down and make an X you see because I want to cross this way now I'm going this way go underneath my wrist now here's what I'm going to do from here I'm going to come up I'm going to go up in between my pinky and ring finger come underneath by my thumb and go back up between my middle and and ring finger here like this once I'm here I'm going to take the wrap and go away from my thumb so I'm here now I'll come across my knuckle come underneath and then I'm going to go back like this okay from this position once I've gone over my knuckle I've come over and I'm going to come across I'm going to make that X oh I came across underneath my wrist make the X and go here once I get to this position it really just depends on how much wrap you have left if you can see I don't really have too much so I'm going to come underneath my knuckle once I'm here I'm going to close my fist come across and then I'm going to just finish it off here on my wrist like this so I came across here and close it so because it's a smaller wrap you can't really get too much I like me personally this one was showing just a little bit more protection on the wrist so with the last time I'm going to show a little more protection on the knuckle but it's generally going to be the exact same type of hand wrap it might just look a little different when I do it with more protection on my knuckle this is how it looks with the bamboo fiber wrap you can see it's just it's not very it's it's not elastic so it's it's a little bit of the fabric is very soft it does feel very comfortable and because I held my hand open it's very form-fitting even though it's not very elastic okay okay so now I'm going to use the more elastic grab you guys can see you can see it's breathable material is very nice I'm going to do with my right hand with that I'm going to focus a little more on my knuckle than I did on this hand okay so the same thing you see there's always the ugly side and the nice side the nice side is always on top we're going to go through the thumb and always just like we come across now because this is more elastic material you can be a little tighter in certain areas I wouldn't recommend being tight around the knuckle but I will be tight around the wrist okay so I'm going to come over only once be a little tight I'm going to come through my thumb same way I did before underneath go around make sure it feels comfortable and because these are this wrap is so elastic like I don't really have to play with it too much it just fits very nicely to my hand so now I'm here I've came I've come over the thumb come across and I'm here I am a little tight around this wrist because I'm not going to focus too much on it at the end so now I'm going to come up to the top I'm going to make that X again look I'm coming across I'm going to go keep my hands open feel slightly tie it not too tight wrap my aweful once then I'm going to come down I finished that X you see went across now look I'm making that X come underneath I'm going to kind of do the same thing I just did on the other hand one two go away from you see going away from the Sun wrap around the knuckle I'm going to come down right away I come down across and come back across and make that X I'm going to come through my pointer and middle finger and now I'm going to finish because I have more wrap now I'm here I'm going to finish more on my knuckle and again it's just a preference it's whatever you like personally now once I'm here have I don't really have enough room to go back around I'm going to finish it all so I'm going to make a fist make a nice tight fist come across and finish off or my wrist so now I personally I do like both wraps me personally I prefer the elastic one though because it fits so well it's a nice tighter fit compared to this one but this one is a little bit more it's because it's not as tight looser so really just depends you know some people have a problem where when they they wrap their hands it might just always feel so tight it's hard to really make this one tight because of the fact that it's not elastic so this might be a better wrap for you they're both about the same this one is ten inches longer we measured in because the vli assisity it technically is longer so it really also just depends on how you want to rap and as you can see my knuckles are a lot more padded on this one is more padding on the wrists my knuckles don't really have as much you cannot tell the difference when I make the fist like this this one is just thicker so again this is just more emphasis on the wrist if you wanted this one it's the same exact method it's just I focus more on the wrist at first and at the end with this wrap I focus on the rib wrist just enough in the beginning and really focus on the level so this might be a way to wrap if you have bigger knuckles if you hit really hard this might be the solid you want because you can always just add a piece of tape for extra support on the wrist so me personally I would go with this style of rapping where you focus more on the knuckle and at the end if I needed it I would just wrap a piece of tape around the wrist just for a little extra support so there it is guys this is how to wrap your hands with 128 reps using the maximum a bamboo fiber wrap and the elastic wrap that they sent us I don't know again this one isn't this I haven't seen it online yet but look out for it because it is an awesome wrap it feels awesome and because of the breathable mesh it's really nice so I hope you guys enjoyed hope it helps everybody so again I hope this video helped you guys if you you know you want to learn to rap with a hundred twenty inch this is just the way I wrap my hands

        "category": "Sports and Fitness",
        "content": "hey guys it's your favorite ninja here going to show you how to rub your hands again na what's hopefully going to be a much better shorter and clearer video now this time I'm going to show you how to rap two different ways okay and the first time the first way is going to be the traditional boxers way now first of all the purpose of a hand rap is not to cushion your hand okay yeah wish you were here anyways it's not to cushion your hand the purpose of a hand wrap is to hold the bones and the tendons of your hand in place when you strike a solid object okay the cushioning of your hands is up to your gloves the way that a hand wrap works is by wrapping your hand okay around and around and around and making it snug enough so that it doesn't cut off your circulation but yet tight enough to where you do make a fist it almost forms like a little cast okay and keeps your wrist immobile and again it helps keep the bones of the hands in place the knuckles and all that stuff okay now the first way we're going to learn is the traditional boxers way we're going to use a 180 inch 1 8 0 180 inch what's called a mexican-style hand wrap it's a little on the stretchy side ok some are stretchier than others today we're using one of my new hand wraps awesome color olive color looks like army green color and this is from title I believe ok now some of them will have it says this side down ok some of them won't but generally what you're going to do on the first type of hand wrap is this little loop right here you're going to place it over your hand okay and you see how there's this well it's it has this side down let's let's just keep it that way the first thing you do is start wrapping your wrist just like this okay and then you go towards your hand just like this you wrap your knuckles a couple of times snug then you start going back towards your hand see that's all we did we just went around the hand now from here normally what some people do is they they start bringing it through the fingers it's called a ring now see I didn't do it so tight that I can't spread my fingers okay so what we're going to do is they generally go here okay come back under go through there again come back under and go through there again and then they will go across the knuckles like that it will come around and do their thumb and then go around the wrist all the way up and then all the way down and if you did it right the little velcro piece will be on the top and you can bill crawl it down okay that's what most people do I don't like that wrap some people do some people don't but I don't like this rep the second way to do it is a a Muay thai-style wrap okay now I've kind of a come up with a version of this of my own it's not traditional Muay Thai it's a mixture of my tying of boxers hand wrap so what I do is I first I form a pad that will fit over them over my knuckles and I do that by folding this end here okay now the thickness of the pad is going to depend on how many folds you do okay we're going to put that over our knuckles right in there like that now the more folds that you do for you use for your pad the less mature material you're going to have to wrap your hand with so you're going to have to figure out how many you can do to be able to secure your hand your wrist and your thumb okay I think here I did something like eight or ten let's do another one okay now what I do is I first see how that is falling off right here this way it's not this way it's this way I place it over my knuckles I make sure that my fingers are spread I reach under and then I just gently push it over the top right there wrapping it up first see what I did I'm not tightening it down I'm not worried about how snug it is I leave a little bit right here off the lip then what I'm going to do is I'm simply going to wrap it around and around towards my wrist okay she goes once twice see how I'm going towards my wrist when I get to my wrist I'll wrap it one time okay now what I'm going to do is remember that little lip that I left right here what I'm going to do is I'm going to Snug that up underneath there just like that see how that looks okay now what I'm going to do is this part now I'm going to bring it over see how I did that right there I'm going to start what's called a figure X instead of coming back under here okay what I do is I come up under my first finger my forefinger see that forefinger and I bring it back towards my wrist as you can see there's an X pattern there the other X pattern is here now I'm going to repeat that with the other fingers over underneath the index finger back towards my wrist making it snug through that finger okay that's the last finger bring it back over see how I'm doing this and making that snug then I'm going to do my thumb I'm going to wrap it once see here's that X pattern it's just an X one around and I'm going to go this way towards my knuckle I'm going to make sure that it's snug right in here it's going to keep my thumb from moving around then I'm going to take this and I'm going to go back towards my wrist right in here now I've got my hand fully wrapped and I've got enough material to go back and secure my wrist I'm going to go up then I'm going to come down I want to go back up then from there voila right there there it is you turn it over you can see that there's a little bit of material there and I just scoop that under there so I can have a little bit of a cushion to grab on to now this is my favorite style of wrap it protects my knuckles it protects my hand it protects my thumb and when I make a fist it tightens up I got to Snug it up a little bit more here and it keeps my hand in place when I strike a solid object it could be anybody's face or it can be a heavy bag doesn't matter but that's the hand wrap that I use okay here's the one that I highly recommend because this is the closest one the closest method to the way that a professional gets his hand wrapped for an actual fight it leaves more material for the top of the hand less wasted material down here okay now I hope you liked it if you have any questions just you know shoot me an inbox message okay it's primarily for the people that are going to be coming around taking some of the self-defense and kickboxing classes but it's for anybody else that wants to learn something new - alright so just shoot me a message and like I said I hope you enjoyed it pretty cool color isn't it like I always said happiness it's a new set of hand wraps okay so you guys next time bye-bye ",

        "content": "this is a hand wrap common garden-variety tape they've got a loop on one end looped around the thumb on the other end from velcro and it allows us to strap it around the waist around the wrist sorry and what we're going to do in this video is just your methods of how to apply the bandage or the hundra successfully to make sure that it stays in position drawing competition drawing bag way and joining Sparling okay I think it's about 11 feet long it's a standard length bandage this okay I'm gonna start you think about it what we need to be a lead we need to be protecting our the wrist but more importantly the knuckle areas what you'll tend to get see people who don't use bandages wraps as well as quite severe damage actually to the knuckles if you don't use proper hand protection you also get lots and lots of sort of friction type injuries in between the knuckles and across the knuckles you lose skin and those injuries are never gonna you know end your career but they're certainly they certainly cause cause you and off frustration and problems to get in the way of your training okay so loop around a thumb you'll notice how I've got the bandage coming off the bottom of rolled after the previous session in such a way so that I can apply it very quickly at the start of this session around the way that the wrist that's the first action so let's do just about three wraps around there I'm not going to be saying you know do three here three there you depends on some hand wraps are slightly longer or shorter than the other so the others bear in mind as well that in terms of protecting the wrist depending on the type of gloves you've got if you're wearing high wrist band the gloves with tough velcro strappings you're going to get lots of support off them as well anyway if you're using just basic bag gloves then you're gonna need to make sure that does it a bit of banter bandaging that support supplier to this wrist here okay we've done all three wraps around the wrist taking the opener cross the back of the hand and around the knuckle one - and you'd be aware you'll be to notice that I'm keeping the bandage quite close to me hands okay I don't want to pull it too far because detect the edges when you pull on it too far out you put it on too tight we want to make sure that we maintain board throughout flow through our hands otherwise your hands become quite dead during a long training session you lose the feeling in your fingertips and stuff so you want to make sure that you you get it on at just about the the right tension the good way of doing that every now and again just make a fist and what that will do is release sort of the tension any built-up tension in the bandage and loosen it off to the right face of your hand okay do another round there so the next thing we want to do is make sure that these strips stay exactly where they are let me do this we're taking it back round wonder the palm of the hand and back over the same way okay so you can see where it's come over there and we're going back along the same line we'd wrap around again go over the top back along the same line okay so you look right through our part we'd see that that is matched on the other side by the other bandage the others part of the bandage and finally up through the center okay now you'll notice I've kept me fingers well spaced again do our little trick just clench your fist ease some of the attention in the wrap and now it's just a case it's hard you know so back round the wrist again oh that's quite a common problem dropping the bandage that's after 30 odd years I'm still regularly able to drop the thing but because we're nice and close towards the ends of wrapping up and you can see nice and steady buckle around the wrist and we're almost ready to tie it off with the velcro around the wrist hence the fist again and you can see there we've got the coverage protection here stops these riding off because that's a big problem you'll find actually if you don't wrap it through the fingers all of the protections rips off onto the back of the palm provides no protection at all doesn't need to be super thick now don't don't forget if you if your hands are susceptible to injury you can put pieces of high density foam maybe or all other layers underneath here to give you the extra protection you need and obviously you can wear 16-ounce big spa and gloss or big ten articles okay simple hand wrap this is my boxing coach ",

        "content": "hey everybody is brazen here would just be personal training out of Phnom Penh Cambodia today I thought I'd make a video for people who train with me and just anybody who wants to know how to put on these boxing hand wraps now if you don't have any experience of boxing like you know that it's very important to wrap your hands especially especially when like sparring or fighting or even just using the punching bag because if you're new to boxing if you do is striking in general your wrists are going to get messed up and I have a couple clients who's you know have some sort of wrist some sore hands and stuff because they're they're new to this and I had to show them how to properly wrap their hand so let me show you guys how it's done here now keep in mind these are the 108 inch wraps they're not the 180 inch I would always always suggest you get the 180 inch wraps but here in Cambodia I've yet to find them anywhere so I got these right here if you would just look out here on my hand so who ever going to start is we're going to make make sure that that we're facing up but this is facing towards your hand this side so I'm going to put it around my thumb okay always go this way so go towards the outside of your hand so for example if I'm doing it like my right hand I'm not going to go like this or I'm going to go like this right around alright so let me show you on the left hand now if you guys can't figure out how to do it on the right hand it's no good okay so all the way down now I'm going to start with my wrist support and notice I have my fingers spread they're not like this or like this and I'm going to explain why in a minute so one two three I like to do three to start then I come around for four what looks to be a fourth but then I'm just going to go diagonal not not like this again but like this you want to cover that pinky knuckle and then start doing this and the reason I say to have your finger spread because if you have them like this you're you're going to put it on tight and then you're not going to better open your hands again butch which is going to be very uncomfortable and and it will cut off the blood the blood flow pardon me so one two three or I go about five personally I mean depends on you depends on big the rap isn't and then I take this and I'm going to just simply take it and go right back down at an angle okay I'm going to come up under the wrist go over the thumb and guys like you want this to be snug like you want it you basically want this hand wrap to fit just the same way you want your pants to fit you don't want to be too tight you don't want them to be too loose you want you want support right and then and then you go over the thumb like I said and then go over the hand just like this now under the hand and this it look guys like you might have to watch this video a couple times you know what I mean now what I do is I come back up over the wrist and I go through my middle and ring finger because I like I personally like like how it feels I like the support and then I go back around and you see I have this little flap here now if you wrap your hands and you still have this thing and it sits up on the top then you guys messed up so you want to do this and cover this part up so now this is not going to come loose and then I just fit part of me I just finish off on the wrist here okay now there's several other ways to wrap your hands and I'll do videos on that as well but basically this is it this is a basic wrist strap 108 inch 180 inches better obviously because you can get more support you can cover more ground so that that's pretty much it guys um come back up here please yeah so if you guys have any questions about fitness boxing fighting nutrition if you guys want to say what's up whatever Jay u SB Cambodia at gmail.com that's just be Cambodia at gmail.com and also check out my youtube channel jus be cambodia please subscribe please share feel free to give video idea suggestions or any of that alright guys Bunch speaking to you peace ",

        "category": "Sports and Fitness",
        "content": "in this video I want to review some Hayabusa hand wraps for boxing and MMA and I also want to show you my favorite way to wrap my hands so let's hop to it first things first there's lots of different hand wraps to choose from and there's not a whole lot you can do two hand wraps to really make them stand out you know one from the other in my opinion that being said the Hayabusa hand wraps do have a few features that I really dig and so in the future I'll get more of those instead of more of these these are the elastic hand wraps some people prefer just the plain cotton ones because there's not stretch or give I personally like the elasticy ones because I feel like you can fine-tune how tight or loose they are a little bit better oh one more thing I learned this method of hand wrapping from a YouTube video made by Pentagon MMA so a big shout-out to you guys thanks for making quality content and I'm gonna link to that video somewhere in this video so over here somewhere check it out ok first things first you're going to unwrap your hand wraps all the way when you get to the end you're gonna see a loop like that and you're gonna see something that is unique to Hayabusa something I love it's a little note that says this end up so I can see that this side up this side up some rap companies don't have that note and what happens is if you accidentally wrap your hand the opposite way you'll get to the end of the wrap and you go to secure it with the velcro but the velcro is on the other side and it's very annoying because you just wasted a couple minutes maybe you're you're going to a training session you need to get there on time you just wrapped your hands and now you can't secure them and you just look a little dumb so Hayabusa once again thanks for making me look less dumb I really like this small little feature that makes my life so much better if you're watching this thank you okay so hand wrapping this is a closed palm system so you're going to start with your palm facing down and this side up facing up you're gonna put the loop around your thumb and you're going to start by wrapping your wrist three times one two three now some people like their wraps tight other people like them loose I like them kind of in the middle and once again the fact that these are elastic lets me control that a little bit more in order to figure out what you like whether you like it loose or tight you're just gonna have to do it you know wrap your hands go spar go hit a bag and just figure out what works best for you a little cautionary you know if you go too tight it's gonna cut blood circulation off to your hands and it's gonna get really uncomfortable so just keep that in mind okay so once you have gone around your wrist three times you're gonna go around your thumb over the top of your thumb boom just like that and then you're gonna go back around your wrist okay so over your thumb and back around your wrist and now what you can see is that the hand wrap is starting to creep up the backside of your hand a bit more think of this as a high-top shoe so when you put put your foot in a high-top shoe the high-top supports the ankle joint right so these hand wraps are doing just that as you creep up the top of your hand you're really wrapping the wrist joint and it's going to support the wrist as it starts hitting a bag pads a person and it's gonna help fight that force that gets put on the wrist then you're going to go around the wrist again and you're going to make half an X go and even higher up your palm then it helps to spread your palm out and then you go three times around the palm one two three now notice you know your rap will get bunched up on the floor and you really have to just lift it up to unravel it it's a little bit helpful once you go around your wrist three times you're gonna go and complete this X so you already went this way now you want to come back that way so you're gonna go around your wrist the other way and that X really creates that support for your wrist joint then you're gonna go around your wrist again and now you're gonna start going in between each finger so pinky ring finger first just like that I'm a bit of a perfectionist when I first started to do this I tried very hard to keep the wrap straight but the crease in between the fingers is a lot smaller than the actual thickness of the wrap and it's going to crease there's nothing you can do the important thing here is that the crease be comfortable so as you put the wrap through your fingers make sure that it doesn't chafe because when you start hitting the bag if it shapes that's not going to be good so you're gonna go through pinky and ring finger first then ring finger middle finger second and then you're gonna go middle finger index finger third right once you do that you're gonna go back around your wrist well then you're gonna wrap it one more time and now as you get to the end of your wrap it's time to close it off so you're gonna wrap around your palm a few more times depending on how big your hands are you might be only able to do it this two times my hands are relatively small so I can go three times and after you go three times you go back around your wrist and you seal it off with this fat piece of hayabousa velcro and now your hands are ready to be put in in gloves start doing some bag work or you look like a mummy a little bit you can go out for Halloween if you if you dig a wrap is more or less a wrap there's not a whole lot that you can do to a piece of fabric to you know make it stand out exponentially more than another piece of fabric what I do really like is that Hayabusa does have that this side up note on it and also the velcro is solid so those are two key features that I personally love and because both these wraps cost the same amount about ten bucks I'm going to choose the Hayabusa once every time plus they're a beautiful green color and silly as it may sound I like the color green and if you follow my channel you know that I'm a green smoothie enthusiast you know I have green water bottles I have green smoothies and now I have green wraps so long story short I like my hand wraps I would definitely recommend them and if you haven't already make sure you check out my other hayabusa product reviews I reviewed some headgear some shin guards and some boxing gloves and I'll put links to all of those videos in this video for more content that's just like this but completely different subscribe to my channel boo tanco films thanks for watching ",
