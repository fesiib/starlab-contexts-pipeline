        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "okay today we're going to be talking about putting a polish on the gun up to it including a mirror shine this gun is a brushed finish you see if you saw my video on restoring Nicks and Scratchy so where I put some scratches on there but I have buff those back out a little bit just so because this is the flattest surface of the gun so it's the best part to show for polishing you're going to need three things including the gun so you'll need a gun and you know white cotton t-shirt that you can cut into pieces or start a similar cotton cloth and you'll need a polishing compound I use mother's mag and aluminum polish it works really well I've used this for years does a really good job so then once you have the things that you need then we can get started okay the first thing you want to do is take your cotton cloth your cotton t-shirt and cut it into multiple little pieces little squares just little pieces like this here and keep two stacks because you're going to have use them for two different things so that's the first thing you want to do is cut those into small pieces okay with one cloth what you want to do is take the mother's mag polish just rub it on just rub rub rub and smile those circles and you'll see like that where it turns black that means you need to turn your cloth you never want to keep rubbing once it's turned black you've used up that spot on your cloth just keep rubbing it in turning the cloth every time you shoot you every time it turns black in a spot just keep turning it okay once you've rubbed it in real good for a while then you take another clean white cloth and you just buff it off small circular motions every time it turns black like that turn it rub with a clean spot of the cloth at all times small circular motions with your thumb like that as you can see that's already starting to shine up now I'll repeat this process about a hundred times okay I don't know how well they'll come across on camera here but you can see starting to get that really high-gloss shine so that's just what you got to do just that little center area right there is where I've been concentrating on that took about 15 minutes of rubbing I've started rubbing on the cylinder a little bit here too so take about 15 min to get that but as you can see that's about the level I want to write they are still 1c a little grain of the metal that I wanted to have a nice polished shine you can keep going further if you want but that's what I'm getting to right there it solved everybody how much they want okay one thing I do that you might choose to do or not to do is I do put the gun in a vise at one point to get these smaller areas and the rounded areas of the barrel I'll put it in a vise and I'll just buff it like it's a shoe shot you know I'll secure the vise down of course when I'm doing it and then I'll just buff you screw this to a big plank of wood and I'll just do this there's like just like as I just like you're trying issues it's good for the sides of the barrel it's good for the trigger guard you know just do that and that'll get do that with one clock hit pause on another cloth to get it off another quality get it on a cloth get it off okay yeah this gun is about to where I want it now polish wise got into a nice shining sea reflects my finger there on the side again it's not exactly a mirror face but I'd say it's probably like a 90 to 95 percent mirror finish I could take a little further if I wanted to but this is about what I think is starting to look good on the gun this is the original finish over here the more the Matt now I really like both finishes but I've got still got a lot of white trash trailer park in me so nothing to me screams classy with a capital K like a high polished revolver so I do tend to lean towards the high polish on my carry guns and so whether you want take it up that high or not your own personal preference oh really want to leave it brush now you can take this back down to a brushed it is easier to take it up to a polish that is to take it back down to a good brush but both ways look nice but I just prefer a nice high-gloss finish so this is just my preference by no means is this the way every gun should be done it does make it harder to take care of fingerprints and everything now one thing I am going to address here real quick is if some people will want to do this with a dremel or a similar tool you can and it's not as easy to damage the finish polishing with a dremel as it is grinding with a dremel but you can still do it you can still leave gouges valleys if you polish too much with your hands you're never going to overwork the surface you're just not going to take too much effort to actually overwork the surface with a dremel you could overwork the surface but the worst part of a dremel and I've seen people ruin some good guns with a dremel is the shaft that's spinning shaft or the dribble they slip the pad slides off you're doing a corner here the pad slides off the shaft hits the edge of the gun it will put an enormous gouge in the metal one that you can't take out so always be careful when you do Dremel and if you're the best the best rule of thumb when using a dremel one again like this is just don't do it by hand take the extra time now go alive this took me about two and a half hours to get this to this but it's worth it for me because I like the look and you know I just sit in front of TV watch television and polish I watch two episodes of Top Gear while I was doing this so now I'll go in and watch another couple episodes and I'll do the other side but just like I said that's all it is it's real easy it's easy technique it just takes a lot of time avoid Dremel avoid doing about power do my hand enjoy it enjoy the way it turns out thank pride in what you did it's okay to use the dream lab now to get these tiny little corners and stuff and I may come in with the Dremel and do some little tiny areas but being very careful to never let the shaft touch the gun and never be doing any large areas where I'm moving the Dremel a lot so that's how you polish up a revolver ",

        "content": "hello youtube today i'm going to show you how to polish piece of brass and a piece of aluminum with just a simple polishing wheel and polishing compound first what you're going to need to do with the brass is sand it down okay you're going to want to put because this is a brass cylinder I'm going to put it in a vise and just sand around it and just sanding it too it's good enough to be polished this is to get all the lumps out of it and inconsistencies in the metal with polishing the more patient you are the better result you'll get you're going to start with the course of grit sandpaper you got and move to the finest grit be very careful to make sure you get all the imperfections out of your metal because the better your metal looks the better result you're going to get I'm not doing a really good job on this because this is just for like demonstration purposes but it's going to come out nice with the 120 grit it's not exactly smooth but it's shinier but you still got all these scratch marks in it so I'm going to move to 320 grit paper and that's going to smooth it out a little bit more you're still going to get some score lines in it those aren't going to completely go away until after you polished it for a little bit of time now I've only spent like a couple minutes on it with the 320 and it's gotten pretty smooth now I want to move to the 500 now with 500 grit just go real slowly and it's going to look like it's polishing it but you're still going to have a bunch of scrapes in it oh I can't stress this enough if you don't do a good job sanding you're not going to have a good polish job but if you're republishing you can skip this step and just go straight into polishing you might not get the best of work if it's pitted okay here's what it looks like after being sanded quite a bit different now after sanding you got quite a bit different so let's go on to polishing now when you're polishing it alright so hot and you just their fault little word of advice when you're polishing it and you have all these little black marks to come up that's actually a good thing because that means you have enough all compound up from time to time you're going to get caked up compound on your polishing wheel so I use a just a masonry trial with a jagged edge for tile and you can use a screwdriver a wire brush anything you want as long as it digs in and scrapes off I have even used a razor blade to clean it off before so whatever you have handy and all you got to do is put it to the wheel and let it grind some of the compound off now after polishing on it for about 10 minutes you can see there's quite a bit of a difference before and after and brass it's not all that hard to polish can you even see the camera in there now that's how you but polished brass now polished aluminum now to polish aluminum you do the same thing with start out with a really coarse sandpaper but you can't actually go like that with a flat piece of metal so I just go in like a circle motion and just now you can see this area here is rougher than this area here so this is what I was sanding this is after 120 grit moving on to 320 which is quite a bit smoother now with 500 grit sandpaper do the same thing and you'll notice it starts to look like it's getting shinier now after about 30 minutes you can see there is a definite difference in the Polish and this is just a scrap piece of aluminum that I had in my garage so you've got polished aluminum polish brass and that's how you polish metal now when you're polishing metal remember the more patient you are the better it's going to turn out when you're polishing metal remember patience is key the more patient you are better it's going to turn out this one only took me about a half hour to do just this section the aluminum took me about 45 to not 45 minutes to an hour to get it to this part this good here so the more and I just gave up on it you can tell that there's inconsistencies in it and all that so more patient you are better it's going to turn out I can't stress that enough so have fun and go polish your engine block or something now have fun and go polish your engine block or something if you have any comments or concerns or just helpful hints leave a comment or send me a message always subscribe to my channel ",

        "content": "I've gotten a lot of questions about how to polish metal so I'm going to try to do this in real time for you guys now what I have here is just a nickel it's been built out with a carriage bolt and it's been soldered to it now you can't really see the detail through the camera but I haven't done anything other than hammered on the carriage ball you can kind of see that monticello right there I'm going to tuck that end to my eighth inch drill press lay it on its side and just behind here I have a cup of water this is my dedicated polishing cup gonna bring it back into the house or your wife will be upset I'm going to start off with 100 good sandpaper this is just common 100 grit sandpaper you get from the store I'll fold it in half and I'll dip it into the water the water helps to keep the sandpaper from getting clogged and it also helps keep the coin cool I'm going to move on to 400 grit this is something you can buy at autozone Pep Boys I like to pick it up at the automotive section of Walmart then move on to a thousand grit and then finally 2000 and that's as far as grip goes and then once the polishing or correction once the sandpaper is done I'll take just a cloth right here just a regular old towel and some of this g3 polishing compound I got from the automotive store as well so see how long this takes in real time turn it on this drill press is turning at 32 rpms per minute with my sandpaper now I'll just rub it along you can see the nickel starting to wear onto the paper and you don't want to breathe this dust so that's also a plus when you keep it wet and I can already starting to started to feel it getting hot don't burn yourself so just keep it wet you'll be fine also as you're polishing a piece like this on drill press you want to be careful that you don't polish it so much or sand it down so much that you sharpen up the edges these edges right here can get very sharp if you if you don't pay attention so if you go in that far down just make sure you send it like this too okay now the hundred grit sandpaper is just about done I'm not feeling any rough spots at least while it's spinning so I'll turn it off and I'll show it to you guys you can already see the detail is mostly gone we're going to move on to the 400 same thing fold it in half put it in your water to help keep the Queen now you could also do this by hand it would take a little bit longer but it's not impossible you can see a little bit of the nickel rubbing off onto the paper and I'll keep on doing this until when I turn it off I'll take a look I'll rub it off to see whether or not I still have lines from the 100-grit if I do I'll keep on going with the 400 if I don't then I'll move on to the 1,000 doesn't take very long I'll shut that off give you guys a look wipe it off in towel real quick you can see it's even more shiny now eventually you'll be able to see the reflection of the camera or even my ugly mug through this piece that we're polishing moving on to a thousand and this sandpaper I think for each pack I paid about three dollars between three and four dollars and it comes with like five seats or four sheets or something like that in each pack and you can use them for for a while okay so I'm starting to feel on the coin and starting to feel pretty evenly each grit of sandpaper gives a distinct feel after the coin has been polished to that grit and that's just something that takes practice so I'll shut that off you can see it's even getting shinier now we're going to go to our final grit which is mm and I was kind of boring but polishing is boring but it's worth it when you give somebody something shiny and they they smile all right shut that off give you guys a look now it's pretty shiny all right you can almost see me you can see my silhouette in the background now once we do the polishing compound then that will really put the shine on it and this is just regular automotive compound you can buy it at any auto goods store and feel right there you want to get on there slowly or else you'll whip all the compound off and we'll start flying everywhere just slowly push it into the towel and also be careful that you don't have any any sharp edges or that you don't suck the towel into your drill press otherwise you can hurt your hand you can see the blackness from the nickel that's really it just being polished alright that's about it we'll shut it off take it out of the drill press now you can see it's pretty shiny I mean this is up close and this camera I'm using you can see it's a flip if you look in the detail but that's it if you want you can drill a hole in it hanging for a pendant or use your new polishing skills for something a little more elaborate thanks for watching ",

polish a piece of aluminium bar stock just to give you an idea most everything I polish is aluminum or copper to start off with I have a couple pieces of sandpaper this is a 600 grit and that's a thousand grit sandpaper I have some masking tape if I need to mask off an area that I don't want polished I have several small Rouge stones here or roof repair these these are from coarse to fine and the various types of Rouge okay and there they're a little solid solid little bars along with that on the backside is a listing of the different metals and the different types of polish you can use wood them to to take them from coarse to fine I think I got this on Amazon but you can get it a lot of places for anybody - I have Haggerty metal polish and I have M AAS I call it Moss metal polish the other thing that I will use is that I will use some steel wool was this for aww steel wool so I'm going to turn this off and swing it back over to the aluminum and we'll go from there okay I have a piece of aluminum bar stock here I've done nothing to it it's you know fairly dirty and roughed up in a few spots but not too bad for it to work with for this I'm going to say I want to mask off an area so I'm just going to wrap some tape around it and I just want to work on the end all right normally like on a flashlight body you may not have to use sandpaper I try not to unless I really had get rid of some grooves but I'll just give you an idea what I do with the paper is I just taken and sand around it and then just move the you know loosen the bar up and move it around as I as I sand and try to work it down work down the defects with a sandpaper okay then as I go through I can progressively go with finer sandpaper this is thousand grit and I can work it down more with a thousand R if you find and you see it does it does take quite a bit off I'm not going to try to take everything off I'm just trying to give you an idea how to polish after the sandpaper then I'll take Faurot steel wool and I'll rub with the Faurot steel wool to try to help some of the sandpaper scratches off and then I want to get it maybe even a little finer if possible and you can use moisture now that can be water or that can be saliva whatever you want to do I use saliva because it actually works better to me than water does it has a little substance to it that the water doesn't so and I'm not going to do that in this video gross everybody out but that's what I would do next is use a steel wool and a liquid such as water or saliva okay from there I'm ready to start working with some kind of polish and what I'll do is I'll just take a piece of paper and I'm not going to use a coarse polish here because rue is here I just don't need it I'm going to use the finest now blue is all-purpose you can use it for just about anything and it's about the finest that you're going to find so I just scrape some down with a knife or I mean a razor blade I just scrape some and drag it across it and get some onto the paper I can't reduce using a piece of paper there any surface as you want then I'm going to take a rag and and what I do with my rags is my rags are all cotton I save I save my old t-shirts they're no good anymore and I save my old cotton socks but they're no good anymore they work great for this and I can cut them up and use them now I'm going to take some haggerty's haggerty's has a little bit more grit to me than the MAS does so I'll use little haggerty's and I'm not going to use a lot I'm using a little bit on my finger and then I'm going to dab it in this in this blue okay and in the blue Rouge and then I'm just going to start rubbing okay so I'm going to do is start rubbing and polish on it now rubbing you know all one way all the time is going to leave I mean unless you're trying for a mirror finish which I guarantee I'm not going to try a mirror finish it's not going to hit I've never been able to get one but I've seen people who could now I'll also rub the other direction okay not not doing circular because I'm still cutting I'm using that blue stuff that blue Rouge and I'm cutting so I'm going to leave cut marks okay and then progressively I'm just going to go finer and softer as I as I polish away here okay then I'll take and clean that off a little bit and you can see I mean it's coming you know it's getting pretty good as a lot shinier than it was a lot nicer than it was then for a final I'm going to use the MAS polish that'll be the last thing that I do when I polish some that stuff is is less gritty and it does a higher polish it leaves a residue which helps protect and I think overall it just does a real great job so I'll do the moss on it and again I'll probably go both ways just to see what it looks like at this point where the moss I you know you could actually go in a circular motion but I don't ever really do that and then you can you know just take it and buff it off with your rag clean it up okay now if you if I could do micro in here you'd see that there's still marks on this if I were to doing this on a flag I probably would have sanded longer but as still as shiny as heck I'm not trying to achieve a mirror finish I'm just trying to achieve a polished finish these this mag light that I just did is a good example of that it's a nice polished finish but if you get down and look at it real close it's not a mirror finish you can see fine scratches in it and I'm really not going to worry about that anyways that's that's how I polish on aluminum and I do it the same way on copper even brass if need be when I get the Steel's well you know that takes a little more if you're doing steel that's a lot harder metal it's going to be more sanding and it's going to be more of the coarser rouge - - before you get to the fine stuff and that's it thanks ",

        "content": "hello everybody in today's video what we are going to do is we are going to clean the surface of our stainless steel refrigerator door and in one of my other videos the one in which I am pulling a dent out somebody happened to just shoot a comment out that said I should probably use a solvent on the entire refrigerator because I guess they thought it was a little bit dirty so anyway so what I'm going to do is show you the best way to clean the stainless steel on the refrigerator doors now of course most people use either olive oil or Pam or there's other things you can use you can use pledge and things like that to put a nice shine on the doors but before you put the shine on the doors what you really got to do is clean a stainless steel first so again in this video we're going to show you how I clean it and the way I do it is I simply take a clean sponge like this and what we're going to do is we're going to put some ordinary isopropyl alcohol on the sponge if you notice this sponge has two sides just like most sponges one has an abrasive side one is a more smooth softer side and we're going to completely saturate the sponge and then we're going to scrub the entire surface of the refrigerator all the stainless steel that you can see now what you don't realize is that application after application after application of your oils and stuff that you like to put on the refrigerator doors to shine it up and to take the fingerprints off eventually becomes actually very dirty you don't even know it but you're not going to realize it until you start trying to clean the refrigerator surface that's when you're going to notice all the dirt of course coming off on your sponge I think actually what happens is the oil becomes a trap for the dirt and just simply going over with more and more oil doesn't take the dirt off you have to take the dirt off first you need to strip the dirt and the oils off the refrigerator surface first before you give it a nice coat of oil next time and don't be afraid to put a little bit of elbow grease into it when you're using the sponge you're going to have to scrub a little bit and from time to time if you have to use the more abrasive side go ahead and use the more abrasive side I wouldn't use steel wool or anything but a good sponge with a rough side does a perfectly fine job taking off the difficult oil and dirt okay so there is what the sponge looks like from just a little bit of scrubbing and here we go want to speed it up a little bit show you what that looks like I'm going to add a little more alcohol to it don't be afraid to use the alcohol it's not going to hurt the metal and it's really going to do a good job of cleaning all the dirt and the oils off the surface metal of this refrigerator make sure you get it into all the little cracks onto the handles make sure you clean the handles and the one thing that I'm not showing in this video is that once you get done scrubbing the entire surface with the sponge and rubbing alcohol what I actually did was I wrung out the sponge in clean water several times and I went over the surface with clean water and the reason why I do that is because what happens is the the alcohol kind of leaves a little bit of a white film on the surface of the refrigerator so it's important that you get that white film off and then once we get the white film off that's when we're going to take out what I like to use I like to use Pam olive oil spray and I guess you could just get some regular olive oil put it on a rag and rub it rub it all over your refrigerator but I kind of use the Pam because I can spray it I kind of wish you can see this straight away if you could see this with your own two eyes you wouldn't believe what this refrigerator is looking like compared to the way it was before I mean the surface is almost like a mirror now from any angle that I look at it is so reflective so nice so shiny that it's pretty amazing and you can't get that shine by simply putting the oil on it you have to clean it first so anyway I hope you like this video I hope it helped this is definitely a good technique please subscribe please give me a thumbs up and I want to hear your comments have a great day ",

        "content": "hello and welcome to skills and trade and today's exciting video we learn how to sand and polish some stainless steel to a mirror finish instead of using wd-40 like in our previous sanding and polishing videos today we're gonna use a luma cut but first I'm going to place instead of our spray bottle and then we're gonna mist all over the stainless steel sheet all right so now we're ready to sand so I'm gonna take our 220 grit sandpaper place it on our hook it pad then we're gonna take some of our luma cut then I'm gonna spray just a little bit on our 220 grit sandpaper it is important that we use a lumix as a lubricant for our sandpaper the key to sanding is to sand in a uniform fashion with approximately the same speed and we need to make sure we hit every inch of the stainless steel sheet ideally we're gonna want to sand away all the tarnish on the stainless steel sheet and we want to make sure that we do not sand too much in any one area so we can avoid divots in the metal now it is time for our next step which is our 400 grit sandpaper and like our 220 grit sandpaper before it we're just gonna place it on our hook a pad spray a little bit of Illuma to the sandpaper and then we're gonna begin sanding now we're gonna take another 400 grit sandpaper place it on our interface pad place it on our hooking pad they're going to slowly work back over the stainless steel sheet to help get rid of some of these lines so what the same kind of idea in mind we're gonna take our 800 grit sandpaper place it out our interface pad place it on our hook it pad and then we're gonna slowly work back over the stainless-steel sheet [Music] continuing with the same technique we're gonna take our 1500 grit sandpaper place it on our interface pad place it on a hook a pad and again we're gonna work over the stainless-steel sheet until we can start making it look like a mirror [Music] we are now ready for our second to last step so we're gonna take our three thousand grit try sack place it on our hook it pad spray with some illumined then we're gonna begin sanding and now finally we are ready for our 5000 grit track so we're gonna place it on our hook at ped spray with a little bit of a luma cut and then we're gonna begin sanding for the last time now that we're done sanding it is time to start polishing so we're gonna take our my Gers polishing pad place it on our hook at Pat and then we're going to take some of our gourds aluminum polish which actually works really well on stainless steel place it on our steel wool which is rated superfine and then we're gonna scrub it into the stainless steel until is black and then we're gonna begin polishing now the key to polishing is to move slowly and allow the drill to slowly work into polish until you get a mere shine so I made the mistake of trying to polish the stainless steel sheet on this hot summer's day after I just got done sanding so the metal was really hot and that made the Polish start to burn so what I had to do was to grab my steel wool place a little bit more polish onto the middle and just hand polish it with our Scot blue shop towels Wow now that is a brilliant mere shine I just want to thank you all so very much for watching please like and subscribe for more videos please leave a comment down in the comment box and have a wonderfull day ",

        "original_title": "HOW TO POLISH TITANIUM",
        "category": "Home and Garden",
        "content": "now one of the things I wanted to show like if I possibly can most modern bikes in the later I'm not sure exactly what you're started but they have titanium exhaust parts now titanium and steel very different of course titanium is harder it comes in seven grades that I know of may come in more now but when we used to make model airplane landing it from titanium we learned a couple of really important lessons about dealing with titanium first of all drill out a hole in it polishing it machining it you need well bit basically special tools it's harder than steel it also oxidizes like rough steel rusts into one color titanium based on the color now you can see this is a little bit of a yellow color because this part has gotten to that temperature where it gets hotter and hotter it'll turn either blue or red based on how hot that part got but what happened I had already polished this once already I wanted to show how it really is no big secret but what will happen is about once a year and today's a snowy day so I got a perfect time to do it going over it I can restore the color get rid of the yellow now some people of course like the yellow to blue I'm never quite sure now as an example if you wanted to and if I'm not saying this would be a great idea but if you wanted to you could take a map gas torch and heat this and it'll turn red and yellow and blue in it maybe if that makes you floats your boat or whatever but I like the polished look and what happens is if I polish this back it hasn't been polished in about a year what will happen at the end of the polishing it will then return to its original color over the course of on how many miles years or whatever but what I did find out really doesn't it's not critical there's no such thing as that I know of of titanium polish doesn't matter the cheapest stuff seems to work what I wanted to show this is one of the things that a lot of people can't figure out how to do this so what I'm saying is maybe there's a tip here maybe there isn't if there isn't will cost you the same thing I take a real big glob Attis put it on a rag now in this case I wouldn't put that much material on unless I was doing a job like this you can really glop it on now a lot of people don't they have never done this or they don't know they polish this part but never get in the back now I don't say you have to get in the back because you're basically not going to see it but you want to see where it transition is and I call this a shoe shine now a simple shoe shine will renew that without even using a power tool and you'd have a snowy day like today or now I know for instance several people Glen had his when we had to Ducati motor out of his the motor out and we had the exhaust pipes we could have done this on the shop floor Kaveri conveniently when it's in the bike a little less can mean but this technique lets you get some part of it now and I went through the whole thing forever but that that is the technique to use the next technique is wrap it around and if you're really lucky you can grab it on the first shot without a hooker or anything and now you see you have the rig wrapped around the whole pipe now that what's nice about this is you don't have to take the exhaust system off the bike which for some bikes is really time-consuming you have to take the radiators off a lot of oil coolers or something this this really isn't a big deal and again this is a rig it just has polish but what it's going to do it's going to let the port where this transitions you won't notice that it's all of a sudden soppy and polish and turned into sandpaper that's the whole deal yeah my suggestion is any part you can take off the bike in Polish is a ton easier when I had this off and I made this whole exhaust system there's it's a lot easier to do this but but what you need to do or what I'm showing to do is once a year maybe is refresh that shine you get a snowy day a rainy day or a day that you know whatever whatever I'm not sure what you can renew this to where it's going to look absolutely better than nude in a matter of five minutes it's and it doesn't matter it aluminum comes up instantly I wanted to show this just as a difference titanium takes a little longer but it takes a little bit longer than to go back to being oxidized and having those three different colors of oxidation and when you look at those colors you can tell you can pretty much tell where that part is getting hot or in the case of an exhaust where there's a restriction as a restriction you can see it right away so anyway this is just basic 101 knowledge there's nothing special here that trick the shoeshine trick is I think a good one that a lot of people have never thought of and you can see that's pretty came up pretty nice now needless to say all of this stuff when you detail out a bike detail out a car it's basically just time and energy and that really came out pretty nice I would think just to show and while we have the compound on the rig I left this well the little cap for the I made this at a carbon fiber the original bike had aluminum parts this aluminum comes right back but the problem with aluminum in a couple of months it goes back to where you got to do this over and over again not sure if you can see how quick that came up bingo these little straps and I made these straps so I know they made out of relatively soft aluminum easy to bend they'll come right up and that's the whole thing but any polishing job a lot of people think it's it's all in what compound you buy and what speed you run the buffer etna mean a lot of times just doing a maintenance back this part here I had this off the bike already polished it over on a big buffing wheel that was super super easy to do this whole piece in here but once you do it is my whole point once you do it and the part is isn't basically flat maintaining it super easy in a matter of maybe a half an hour I'll have the whole bike done 45 minutes whatever by the time Karen brings out the cookies in the coffee but I just show in those parts you can look at I don't think we've gone five minutes on the video now what you can do if you want to go spend a little more time now keep in mind this is the part you see you're looking right here your eye only picks up this part it doesn't see back there so that part right there we'd like to get an exceptional now you really want to go to the next take you so I called to make yourself crazy level what this pit is a soft pad now this'll protect it over the winter while it's sitting out here this whole garage again each one of these it just pays just to just the module little test here's one of the things you can always use as a wheel like this to do some of the polishing again these things aren't that expensive but this will allow you and of course the thing about all of this it's in the eye to beholder maybe some people like it looking rough some people like it shine yeah I personally like that it makes cleaning the bike after a ride especially you're right like we've had lately as the roads are dirty it makes cleaning a bike so much easier to be able to do this or to maintain it now it's not already polished but it's got a nice coat of wax on it to boot but I just wanted to show that a couple other little things while we're talking about titanium here again all these pipes on this bike are titanium this slide I purposely didn't polish I wanted to show the this one has that that taint of yellow orange that will polish right off things like the shift linkage it's easy to take it right off the bike and polish it but the biggest part of this whole bike let me move this over here turn this the biggest part of this bike to polish well let's do it from this side first those pipes in there I spent a lot of time polishing them up that really was a big job but again it might in my case it's a lot of everything and this thing is a labor of love let's face it let me look from this side and I think when you when you look at that compared to a stock motorcycle I like that look a lot better it's a lot easier to clean it's a lot easier to maintain and it's just one of the things now what we're talking about titanium that bike that's a focal point of the bike having those pipes polished when those pipes were not polished I didn't like it at all they have kind of polished up nice now it's a nice little detail it's a detail you can do yourself that won't cost you a penny we just did a video on polishing up this engine if you really want to have a labor of love go pick up an old fzr and polish the frame my god I can't even remember we did a lot of this in Luciano's garage but it was 5 degrees out I bet Luciano didn't forget that another thing that's easy to polish up I had these off when I restored this bike all of these things come right off that makes it real easy all the parts down here had to swing an arm off the bike I think we do have a video out there in fact it's one of them that has you know several hundred hits so but that's my point and of course the Rd engine these are the little things that they're not big the little things but this is what happens is I decide at some point in time that I like the way this stuff looks and so there's a little bit of a price to be paid in terms of energy time whatever but in the end it's all the little details that when you're getting a bike ready for a ride you know just having that polished up and I never really realize how how important it is to me anyway until all of a sudden I park next to somebody it just has a brand new stock bike and then I think wow even these rims I polished these rooms up if that isn't the way a stock bike comes so that's just another thing but I just wanted to share that little tip these little polished parts and polishing titanium pretty much like steel except it just takes a little more work in in the end I think it adds a nice little touch to any bike no matter what bike you do and I hope hope some part of this little video inspired you - I don't know brush your teeth or whatever I'm never sure what anyway hope you enjoyed it ",

        "content": "yo what is going on guys so today moving if you guys how to completely clean your windshield or any window that's on your car I make it completely water repellent and all that good stuff let's get it done alright guys purveyors three main things you need there's a water repellent some steel wool make sure it's a forty up and just a rag let's do it so first thing you want to grab your steel wool and just clean the entire windshield with it and it's not going to do anything to the windshield just going to clean it what you're basically doing is polishing it taking all those little water marks that are on there all that you know completely clean it off now you don't have to wipe it down for you do this but if you want to but it's not really necessary unless you got mud and we'll punch all the dirty stuff on there you're going to do clean the whole entire windshield I don't know if you guys can see that probably can't but when you do it yourselves you most likely will that just completely cleans it now make sure you don't get this steel wool wet because I know Ben the rust and then that's not going to be good and if you see right here hopefully you guys can see this just little stained edge right here alright watch this pletely cleans it up you do the whole entire windshield like this you go ahead you move on to the other side and if you watch it you'll be able to feel the difference between this side and the other side that you haven't done yet now I don't know if you can see this line right here from this line down making with my finger all the way up is all nastiness just wipe it down just do one whole entire windshield when this out the way see this right here watch nice and clean now if you're going to leave a little bit of residue a little bit of things of Steel you just wipe that down after then you're going to grab your rag just wipe down all of them still that's left and you probably feel a little bit of well what is it close almost cold I cannot let you go a little bit of restriction they go for stupid fine feel a little bit of restriction while doing it that's because it's nice and clean this only takes like 15 20 minutes to do not even go to the other side see go over here write down all the excess steel wool alright and now if you want you go ahead and you do it again as you can see this tool still good you could do like four or five cars all the windshields do it one more time make sure it's nice and clean and you wipe it back down again now that's if you want you don't have to but I like to make sure it's nice and clean alright guys you just finish it up wiping it back down for the second time and now after that after that you're going to grab some of your rain-x water repellent now you saw this at Walmart or whatever or any Autosport store that you might find but make sure you don't use the rag that you wipe down the steel wool with here's another one because you want to put all that steel wool back on there and all you got to do is one moment one second all you really need is just a little bit just the corner grab this that's not I'm not getting on the paint because that might be bad but you grab this and you just put it all around your windshield yeah I'm doing it all around the windshield now what this is going to do is when you're driving and it's raining while I rays are going to just switched right off just go right off the windshield and the second time I'm doing it to my car I recorded first time because I know if it was going to work but it works and I'll show you guys that works like right now let go let go these that tell you it works no straight away to show real quick see how it stayed on there that's the untreated winch you it doesn't do anything now this one look at how hopefully I see it starts beating off slowly I'll show you guys when I'm drawing it me undo anything it all stays in the same spot I hope you guys saw that there's not a lot of luck so hopefully I put that little clip in and if I didn't oh well but it works trust me then don't you go to the other end you might run out so just put a little bit more just a terabit you don't need a lot but I like to put a lot just go ahead do the whole entire windshield who's calling me hold on sky there anyway once you get the whole windshield you can see it it's all then look all nasty you know gay I'm not getting all glazed can be all glazed just let it dry for like 10-15 minutes it might be smarter to put it right in front of the Sun to the edge rising faster but okay alright guys so after you let the first layer dry and it's all nasty and glazed and whatnot what I do I put another one another layer of it now you don't have to but now you don't have to but I do that way I know it's nice and stick on there know that it's going to be good decent sized layer do the same thing over just circular motion with the whole entire windshield and after you get the whole entire windshield this time around you just let it dry again for another 15 well maybe just ten minutes to let it drag in go to the other side just like it's raining like I said the water is just going to come right off you not gonna need to do anything to use your wipers a lot less on all I do alright guys so after you put the second layer on if you close to what you're going to go to do is go inside and as you can see it's all hazy or ugly spit all windows and we can really tell but I did all of them what you then do now you're going to go inside a new fresh wax you're going to need a three rags in total you can give you fresh rag you got water down nice wet clothes and you need another one dried on to dry it all bad so what you're going to do just wipe it down show is damp not very wet you know just damp it's pipe it all down then as soon as you wipe it with the wet one just dry it off that way just leave any streak marks anything like that and you swipe it down again now the thing here is you want to wipe it down as soon as you wipe it with wet one that way doesn't leave any water more exert any thing like that you have a nice clean line through and for the inside of the car I like to use this invisible invisible glass cleaner this thing does not leave any streaks nothing like that check it out spray it on all right then grab another rag you guys are going to need a lot of rags with this grab a rag and you just simply just wipe it down and there you go guys that's how you do it so you guys think this video is useful make sure you like share subscribe all that cool stuff leave a comment if you got any questions hit me up trust me it works ",

        "content": "hey this is madman and hardcore and what we're gonna talk to you about today is how to polish engine parts you've seen under hoods of really nice cars or they got all kinds of shiny parts and you wonder how did they do that other than taking it to a chrome shop and having it chromed this is a way you can do it for free all it takes is time sandpaper and time and patience and a little bit of polish at the end so what you want to do first is get a few grits of sandpaper together we've got 320 grit here we've got knives 800 grit there and then we've got thousand grit there that's the final we're gonna go with now if you want a more shiny desired effect and taking out more of the rough looking stuff then even after you've gone through 320 800 and 1000 you can even go to 2,000 which I'll even get it to a more mirror-like finish but I just took it to a thousand grit and when the sandpaper starts to look like this on the thousand grit you put a little polish on there and you use that to get the final shine and then you wipe it off with a towel so basically that's the overview of what we're gonna do and she's gonna demonstrate on this one part of the intake manifold here so you just go in a circular motion or up and down however you want what you're trying to do is get the rough see little rough things you see in there you're trying to go through you're trying to get all that rough casting marks off and get it smooth so you're gonna rub that until the sandpaper looks like this I'm your 320 joining just like this when you're done all full of aluminum and when that happens then you can move to the 800 grit in the same deal you keep rubbing on it till it starts getting it's all full with aluminum and then you move to your thousand grit until it's all shiny like shiny aluminum then add a little polish and that finishes it off so we're gonna let her polish for a while polish this intake manifold and what we're gonna be doing here she's gonna keep polishing till we get all these rough edges off all these fill casting some imperfections great we'll be right back with you for the next grit all right as you can see right now we've used the 320 and we're ready to move on to the 800 grit see how a lot of the rough edges are already gone so now we're gonna move to 800 and bring it even closer to that shine we're all going for it so after she does this for a little bit we're gonna break until the next grit which is just a thousand grit will be coming next and that's where we're gonna finish it off all right we're now on the thousand grit sandpaper and she's just started so this is the final grit and what you do is you just keep rubbing on the intake manifold with this thousand grit until you almost have a mirror-like shine and once you get to that point where the sandpaper starts to look shiny such as this then you add just a little bit I mean a real small bit of some metal polish let's see let's take a look at the sandpaper okay we're there alright I'll show you how much polish to put on just put a little bit here just rub it in you can rub it in with the sand now rub it in with the sandpaper just start going circular motions and this line whacks up well it's just gonna be wax on so you just keep going circular motions until you buff it out until you'll start seeing that shine just climb out of there from the sandpaper alone so just keep circling and circling and circling and if we want to accelerate this a little bit just for the video purposes I can do this to dry it off a little bit stop for a second okay now if you going now just start to see the shine come out see how it's starting to shine keep going just like that see how it's the shine starting to come out go a little faster and a little harder to basically get this since we're kind of on time YAG now we are and look at that see it's starting to come out and we kind of did this quickly I mean what you want to do is when you do something like this is take your time turn on some music so you get some rhythm going if you like beer and a beer there have a beer you know just take your time and before long you'll have like a mirrored like animal almost like a beer almost like you paid someone to chrome it see how the shines start to come out now how's your sandpaper looking turn isn't over yet but we're almost to the shine keep going see we're almost there but remember the more time you take on this the better the product looks yeah is doing this clip to demonstrate how to do this but I mean if you sit down and just relax and do this and then just look at that Wow it can look like a comparison you can see every little blemish when you start to polish so if you're not happy with the results you can always go back to the 320 to get all those little you know imperfections out and then back to the 800 and back to the thousand then to the Polish so just because you're not happy with the result you can go back to the other two to grits and just work with it so now I'm gonna show you what I did yesterday on this intake manifold turn the manifold around gently and easy there we go nice and easy and there's what I did the other day wow that's how it looks when you're done it just takes a long time to show you so I just showed you one spot so here you have it this is how you do it so wear gloves you don't want this to happen unless you want to have nice shiny aluminum fingers shaven like that guy from the movie was doesn't look like the liquid metal duan tournament Agers permitted her hands anyway anyway that's it for now I hope you learned something thanks for watching budget boosting if you liked us like us on Facebook like our YouTube page budget boosting comm check it out and remember our window stickers Thank You Carly good yeah exactly every little bit helps and remember knowledge is power it's horsepower okay not all pot filters are created equal okay you got this kind of a so-called pod filter which is a K&amp;N air filter and this air filter is designed to go in a Dodge Neon a very small engine a 2-liter four-cylinder so yes it's appropriately sized and see some of these other air cleaners ",
