The tutorial explains how to review and select from three variations generated by Photoshop's Generative Fill in the Properties panel. The tutorial explains how to use the Remove Tool by selecting it from the toolbar, enabling Sample All Layers, painting over unwanted areas, and pressing Enter to apply changes. The tutorial explains using the Object Selection Tool and a black brush on the Generative Fill layer mask to restore original image parts. Use the Lasso tool to make a smaller selection around the area to refine, then apply Generative Fill to adjust the edges for a seamless blend. The tutorial explains how to manually use Content-Aware Fill in Photoshop by selecting data, adjusting opacity and color, and using a preview window to refine results. The tutorial explains how to use the Clone Stamp Tool by selecting it, setting a low flow and opacity, choosing a reference point with alt-click, and painting to blend areas. The tutorial explains using Content-Aware Fill by selecting it from the Edit menu, previewing the fill result, and making necessary adjustments. The tutorial instructs using the Eraser Tool to refine the sampling area by removing unwanted parts from the green overlay, enhancing the Content-Aware Fill results. The tutorial advises outputting the fill result to a new layer for non-destructive editing. The tutorial explains how to convert a path created with the Pen Tool into a selection by right-clicking on the path and choosing 'Make Selection', then confirming with OK. Instructions on opening the image in Photoshop are provided.",
