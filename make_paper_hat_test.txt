ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[2 - 2] hi guys welcome back to origami twist my
[2 - 6] name is Jenna and today's video is one
[6 - 10] that is meant for all of those people
[10 - 13] who have been dealing with snow days and
[13 - 16] born children as a result of the snow
[16 - 19] days now as you probably know I live in
[19 - 21] Australia but I am from the northeastern
[21 - 24] part of the United States and boy oh boy
[24 - 26] have you guys had some weather recently
[26 - 30] whoa Facebook was literally blowing up
[30 - 32] with oh no not another snow day we're
[32 - 34] gonna be going to school in July at this
[34 - 37] rate right oh it's horrible but if
[37 - 40] you've got young children and they're
[40 - 42] stuck inside all day hopefully you got
[42 - 45] up to play in the snow but this
[45 - 47] particular project is great for
[47 - 51] imagination and playing dress-up and
[51 - 53] coming up with stories and ideas and
[53 - 56] basically kicking the kids out of
[56 - 58] boredom and you don't have to be in a
[58 - 62] snow snowy area of the world in order to
[62 - 65] do it it is the classic newspaper paper
[66 - 69] hat so yes you probably already have all
[69 - 70] the materials necessary to make this
[70 - 74] project and say all you need again one
[74 - 77] sheet of newspaper and let's get started
[77 - 82] so I have a what appears to be like a
[82 - 86] half size newspaper and if you've got
[86 - 87] one of those big ones just fold it in
[87 - 88] half and then fold it in half again
[88 - 91] until you have this rectangle about this
[91 - 94] size then the rest of it is really
[94 - 96] really easy you're just gonna fold one
[96 - 100] corner in to make a right triangle there
[101 - 104] you go and you're folding at the middle
[104 - 106] and then you're going to fold the other
[106 - 109] corner in to make another right triangle
[109 - 113] again folding down in the middle so
[113 - 114] you'll have a long skinny strip down
[114 - 118] here and two triangles up top you're
[118 - 120] going to fold this flap up it onto
[120 - 121] itself
[121 - 124] okay let's see how I folded it up onto
[124 - 126] itself to meet the bottom of those
[126 - 130] triangles and then you just fold it up
[130 - 134] again okay now you're going to turn it
[134 - 136] around and do the same thing you're
[136 - 139] gonna fold that bottom flap up so that
[139 - 142] it meets roughly at this point at the
[142 - 145] bottom of the triangle and you should be
[145 - 148] able to tell where that bottom is just
[148 - 150] by looking at the other side so just
[150 - 152] guess it's very rough it doesn't have to
[152 - 154] be perfect and then you're gonna fold
[154 - 158] that rectangle up again so that it
[158 - 161] matches the other side now all that you
[161 - 165] need to do at this stage is open it up
[165 - 169] and as you can see it creates what
[169 - 171] appears to be like a captain's hat
[171 - 173] now I'm sorry I haven't been looking at
[173 - 174] you this whole time I'm trying to see
[174 - 176] myself in the screen I'm not used to
[176 - 177] doing tutorials this way so thank you
[177 - 180] for bearing with me and without further
[180 - 186] ado that's it okay
[186 - 188] now I've got another couple of videos
[188 - 191] that work great with this it's called
[191 - 194] the captain's shirt story it uses this
[194 - 196] as a base and then it turns into a
[196 - 198] really neat interesting story so if
[198 - 200] you're interested in going a bit further
[200 - 202] with this fold let me know in the
[202 - 204] comments below and I'll make videos for
[204 - 208] that so in the comments below yes please
[208 - 211] on the captain's shirt story or whatever
[211 - 213] you know you'd like to put down there
[213 - 215] and thank you so much for watching
[215 - 218] please subscribe if you enjoy paper
[218 - 221] crafting and that sort of thing and I
[221 - 234] hope you guys have a fabulous day bye

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

[7 - 7] hi I'm Jenny Jones and I'm an arts and
[7 - 9] crafts expert I'm here today to show you
[9 - 13] how to make a paper hats
[16 - 16] you can use any paper to make your paper
[16 - 18] hat but I would recommend that you use a
[18 - 21] nice big piece of newspaper or a3 paper
[21 - 24] if you want your hat to fit your head
[24 - 26] you're going to need one full sheet of
[26 - 29] newspaper what you need to do to start
[29 - 31] with is take the top of the paper and
[31 - 35] fold it down make a crease and then I
[35 - 37] want you to take your ruler and you need
[37 - 45] to measure half way draw a line
[47 - 47] place your ruler and your pencil to the
[47 - 50] side and then you're going to take the
[50 - 52] top left-hand corner of the newspaper
[52 - 57] and fold it down to that middle center
[57 - 60] line and make a crease now do the same
[60 - 64] for the other side to the middle and
[64 - 69] make a crease okay and then I want you
[69 - 74] to take the top piece of paper and fold
[74 - 83] it up again make a crease across and you
[83 - 89] need to turn the newspaper over now
[89 - 91] depending how much you fold these size
[91 - 93] bits in or determine whether it'll fit
[93 - 96] your head or not so if it's for myself I
[96 - 102] would fold it in about this much and do
[102 - 107] the same for the other side and then
[107 - 109] lastly you need to fold the other side
[109 - 118] of the paper up to match make a crease
[124 - 124] and there you have it you'll paper hat

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[18 - 18] okay hi guys today we're going to make a
[18 - 22] Mother's Day hat for you and it's for
[22 - 24] Mother's Day coming up on Sunday we're
[24 - 26] gonna have a little Mother's Day Tea
[26 - 28] Party for Jillian's preschool tomorrow
[28 - 31] so we're doing this in preparation for
[31 - 34] that for all the moms in her preschool
[34 - 37] see so it looks really cute on this is
[37 - 40] the finished product and all the moms
[40 - 42] I'm happy to wear it tomorrow so here we
[42 - 44] go so the things that you're going to
[44 - 48] need is one large piece of butcher paper
[48 - 51] or newsprint will work too and then
[51 - 54] you're going to need two sized bowls one
[54 - 58] larger than the other and so two bowls
[58 - 63] scissors stapler really just stapler and
[63 - 68] some tape okay so let's get started so
[68 - 70] first you start off by forming the Hat
[70 - 72] so you need a mold and that's what the
[72 - 74] bowls are going to do I'm going to put
[74 - 76] the bowl underneath the smaller bowl
[76 - 80] goes underneath the paper okay right in
[80 - 82] the center and then Julian can you help
[82 - 86] switch down the paper a little bit okay
[86 - 89] there you go so then you're going to
[89 - 93] place the larger bowl on top
[97 - 97] put your hand up go ahead and push down
[97 - 103] the bolt and that's the uniform that the
[103 - 106] top with the Hat and you kind of just
[106 - 107] spread off the paper
[107 - 110] give me a lot of folding and cutting
[110 - 115] involved with this and stately okay this
[115 - 118] is just getting the shape of the Hat
[118 - 120] once that's down secure then you can
[120 - 127] lift it up there's the top of the half a
[134 - 134] little Bowl still there okay let's put
[134 - 136] it back we don't want to lose our shape
[136 - 138] here so the next thing I'm going to do
[138 - 140] is to secure the shape we're going to
[140 - 142] use some masking tape okay
[142 - 144] so Jillian why don't you hold down this
[144 - 150] paper you hold the top and we're going
[150 - 153] to start just circling around the Hat
[153 - 160] with the tape kind of press it down as
[160 - 168] you go
[173 - 173] good job Jill and then we're gonna have
[173 - 181] to measure it to see if it fits
[185 - 185] okay it's a little bit big so you can
[185 - 190] take it in by folding it a little bit so
[190 - 191] if it's a little big you can just kind
[191 - 196] of fold it over a little bit what we're
[196 - 200] going to do the rim in a second okay and
[200 - 203] then just use some more tape I like to
[203 - 206] put a second row tape on just to make it
[206 - 215] really secure since the paper is very
[215 - 219] large I'm going to trim the edges so we
[219 - 222] have less paper to work with I'm just
[222 - 224] going to go around and trim it kind of
[224 - 230] in a circle okay so now this is the fun
[230 - 233] part with the kids you'll get to make
[233 - 236] the brim of the Hat just like this so it
[236 - 238] has a little brim all around the sides
[238 - 241] make it finished and look nice so what
[241 - 242] they're going to do is just fold around
[242 - 246] and go all the way around okay go ahead
[246 - 246] Jo
[246 - 254] keep folding it up go and turning it and
[254 - 257] kind of go along after them and press it
[257 - 265] down press it down right there you go
[269 - 269] and then I'm going to go around behind
[269 - 272] her and staple it to secure it and it
[272 - 283] doesn't have to be even lots of muscles
[283 - 287] then there's your undecorated hat ready
[287 - 296] to go let's see okay so we're done with
[296 - 299] the hats the only thing left to do is to
[299 - 301] paint them and make them colorful so
[301 - 302] tomorrow we're going to paint them with
[302 - 305] their preschool class and it should be a
[305 - 308] lot of fun right okay so see you
[308 - 344] tomorrow

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[4 - 4] today I'm going to show you how to make
[4 - 6] a Indian hat out of construction paper
[6 - 9] with just a few steps first i'm going to
[9 - 11] show you what materials you need you
[11 - 13] need a construction paper you need your
[14 - 17] feathers to need your paint and your
[17 - 22] paintbrushes a stapler scissors and some
[22 - 25] clue to get started the first step is to
[25 - 27] cut the construction paper now you have
[27 - 30] to make sure and figure out how big your
[30 - 33] head is so you need to see how how much
[33 - 36] you're going to need so you can just cut
[36 - 39] into strips this small strips they don't
[39 - 45] need to be huge stripped
[49 - 49] so because my head is a bit larger than
[49 - 51] this we're going to need two of those
[51 - 65] strips so there you are you're our two
[65 - 68] strips we need to put them together the
[68 - 70] next step to put them two going together
[70 - 72] you must have your stapler so you're

[93 - 95] to put your feet so you can pay anything
[95 - 97] you want so what I'm going to do is I'm
[97 - 100] just going to ask the blue dots just
[100 - 110] around and then I'm just going to do a
[110 - 123] green squiggly line
[129 - 129] so you're going to put your feathers so
[129 - 130] what you're going to do is you're going
[130 - 134] to take your glue and you're going to
[134 - 142] glue it to be back

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[7 - 7] Winston you want to show everyone how to
[7 - 11] make a nurse hat no you want to play
[11 - 14] with the container camera okay so today
[14 - 15] I'm going to show you how to make a
[15 - 17] really cute little nurse hat I made
[17 - 19] these for my friend's bachelorette party
[19 - 22] and it was super fun and super easy so
[22 - 24] you start off with for you
[24 - 30] square square my square is I don't know
[30 - 33] I just kind of estimated 21 and a half
[33 - 38] centimeters or eight inches or something
[38 - 39] like that
[39 - 41] eight and a half inches it's a square so
[41 - 44] both sides are the same length okay then
[44 - 47] the top of my square I cut two slits
[47 - 50] again I just kind of estimating it's not
[50 - 53] being a very good in the crafter so it's
[53 - 58] like three inches about or seven
[58 - 61] centimeters obviously it's not super
[61 - 62] duper important how big it is because I
[62 - 64] just asked me to indicate myself anyways
[64 - 66] okay so you have your three slits cut
[66 - 69] with scissors you're going to take these
[69 - 72] two you're going to fold them so that
[72 - 79] they match see the edges match nicely
[79 - 85] and I just use tape this is I just made
[85 - 87] it not too hard because I had to make
[87 - 91] like 15 of them or something so that was
[91 - 96] that once it steeps kind of flaxen edge
[96 - 98] hold the edges now I have a shape like
[98 - 102] this lovely pink then you take the top
[102 - 106] part and fold it over the other two
[106 - 110] parts Erin you take your tape and you do
[110 - 114] the same thing tape fix hold on your
[114 - 118] tape a bit now you have a sheet like
[118 - 122] this
[125 - 125] very good I stuff a little flat cross on
[125 - 128] the top then you're going to look at it
[128 - 131] and you have this big thing so I pulled
[131 - 137] it and folded it again so now I know
[137 - 139] exactly how my nurse hat is going to
[139 - 142] look fake it so just so it has those
[142 - 145] things there then I just kind of need
[145 - 150] little folds on the sides of it when you
[150 - 154] put it on your head it's going to sit
[154 - 156] like a little cap so just trying to bend
[156 - 158] the edges a little bit so see how it
[158 - 161] makes kind of a little pact once you
[161 - 163] have your little edges in then you can
[163 - 170] go ahead and fold your thing back up a
[170 - 176] little bit nurse hat so cute these fit
[177 - 178] on our heads really really well and all
[178 - 180] we did was just stick some bobby pins in
[180 - 181] the back
[181 - 183] JooJoo and they stayed in our head
[183 - 185] really really well if you want to go a
[185 - 187] little bit further you can take some of
[187 - 190] this stuff hmm I chose black before a
[190 - 196] bride we had white and I'm super lazy
[196 - 198] and don't have a lot of crafting
[198 - 203] materials I just used regular tape put
[203 - 207] it on my sail material and dock it in
[207 - 211] the back so it would come out of the
[211 - 213] back of our thing and I put a few layers
[213 - 216] that are always anyway so that's how we
[216 - 217] run around the what the bride had a
[217 - 220] black hat and had a white veil and it
[220 - 222] was super funny and cute and easy and
[222 - 224] everyone loves them
[224 - 227] isn't that right Winston everyone loved
[227 - 235] them even rinsed
[239 - 239] there you go do you like that book no
[239 - 246] Zack Winston yeah didn't you

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[8 - 9] hey guys bill here and today we're going
[9 - 11] to be making paper hats and I've already
[11 - 14] made one if you want to take a look this
[14 - 16] is what it should and look like a themed
[16 - 20] so I'm going to do it step by step so
[20 - 23] you can use any type of paper you want
[23 - 25] wake up use your newspaper for now i
[25 - 28] would first thing you need to do is to
[28 - 33] make sure that it's amble flat on the
[33 - 37] edges especially even and definitely on
[37 - 39] this side you don't it all like bumpy
[39 - 44] and you do the heart so that's how flat
[44 - 46] it should be and then you want to fold
[46 - 49] it in half again so we fold it like this
[49 - 52] you need to fold it so it's perfectly
[52 - 56] not off the edge so I need to do it like
[56 - 59] that now we have to make sure it's
[59 - 64] flutters down like that playgirl press
[64 - 67] and all the rest out and that's the
[67 - 69] second part and now we need to fold it
[69 - 73] back out to get that was just to give us
[73 - 75] 10 tonight page so now we need to fold
[75 - 78] this part of the paper we just go like
[78 - 80] this we need to make sure it's right on
[80 - 83] the middle right on target that make
[83 - 87] sure top right just like that I mean
[87 - 91] lots of the flowers much as we can there
[91 - 94] we go so you have to do it to the crease
[94 - 96] in the middle that's what the creased is
[96 - 98] fought and now we have to do it to this
[98 - 101] side now straight to the middle make
[101 - 104] sure it's connected to my name is it
[104 - 108] flatten it right now now you have to
[108 - 112] fold this part and just the one part so
[112 - 115] you need that bottom part there and then
[115 - 121] you just phone it to where that is there
[121 - 125] then you have to flatten it down make
[125 - 127] sure the triangles stay down so now we
[127 - 131] have to fold this part or so you get the
[131 - 133] side of the half to make sure perfectly
[133 - 138] flat now we do the opposite side exactly
[138 - 142] the same that's why we have the need the
[142 - 146] this side so we go to the other side and
[146 - 151] fold it half here just make sure
[151 - 155] straight there and then fall it again
[155 - 158] and make sure it's in line with the
[158 - 164] other one with that and then you could
[164 - 170] bleep open it up like that and then we
[170 - 175] should have ok perhaps so also if you
[175 - 177] wanted to you could like Curro it in and
[177 - 180] do like like just a quick really so you
[180 - 182] could turn into a pirate hat if you

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

The transcript with time-stamps (in seconds) is as follows: ```
[3 - 3] today we're going to make hats oh did
[3 - 5] you see I took off my hat
[5 - 6] that's right take off your hat it'll
[6 - 8] take my dog we're gonna make hats out of
[8 - 12] newspaper and for this all you need is
[12 - 14] newspaper so I'll take one of these one
[14 - 16] sheet while you're there so what do we
[16 - 19] read in today no no no we're just not
[19 - 21] reading we're making hats we're making
[21 - 24] hat so all right so normally a newspaper
[24 - 26] is already folded so we can already
[26 - 27] leave that folded right there
[27 - 29] great just like this and we're going to
[29 - 31] take that and we're going to you know
[31 - 33] they say what did they say when when
[33 - 35] you're folding it there's hot dog and
[35 - 37] hamburger is that right so that's ham
[37 - 40] hamburger is a cross you know so you
[40 - 42] have a wider one and then hotdog would
[42 - 44] be the thinner one right yep
[44 - 46] so what we want to do is we want to give
[46 - 49] one fold in half hamburger style number
[49 - 52] seven all right so then we're making a
[52 - 55] crease right down the middle of it it
[55 - 56] doesn't even it doesn't have to be
[56 - 58] perfect that pair of nothing has to be
[58 - 61] right so now we have a nice crease right
[61 - 63] there right in the middle and now we're
[63 - 66] going to make we're going to fold the
[66 - 68] corners the top two corners where the
[68 - 71] fold is you see that there's already
[71 - 72] pulled down we're going to fold those
[72 - 75] corners in at the half
[75 - 78] like right along that crease so there's
[78 - 81] one side you see and then here's the
[81 - 83] other side and we'll both do them on the
[83 - 89] same same side here so now what you have
[89 - 93] should look like this that's what you
[93 - 95] should be seeing and this should be kind
[95 - 97] of open on the bottom right did you have
[97 - 99] a couple scoops oh how you doing there
[99 - 101] Brian I think I'm doing pretty well
[101 - 105] all right good so now the next step is
[105 - 107] that we're going to see yeah the bottom
[107 - 109] edge around here right here and you see
[109 - 111] how you have two sheets it looks like
[111 - 113] you have two sheets of paper there
[113 - 115] together for we're going to fold the
[115 - 118] first sheet of paper up so just one yeah
[118 - 120] and it's kind of like I guess hot dog
[120 - 123] style you're gonna pull it right all the
[123 - 125] way up make it so it looks like this
[125 - 128] right yeah that's right it's a nice
[128 - 130] thick creaser so then so this is what
[130 - 132] that side should look like is that you
[132 - 134] folded right along this
[134 - 138] were those two triangles where those two
[138 - 140] corners came in and you fold it right up
[140 - 143] along here okay so now you're gonna flip
[143 - 147] it over so you see just the back back
[147 - 150] and now this is where we're gonna size
[150 - 152] it now I have a really big head so I'm
[152 - 155] only gonna do small yeah so I'm gonna
[155 - 158] make I'll make a smaller hat for the
[158 - 159] people on the internet because they
[159 - 160] probably don't have as big a head as I
[160 - 162] do and then you're trying to make a big
[162 - 164] hat so they could fit around your food
[164 - 166] around my head so what what we do here
[166 - 170] is we take these sides the whole side
[170 - 172] right here and we fold it in so here's
[172 - 174] one side we're gonna fold this in you
[174 - 177] know we're Emison as much as our much so
[177 - 180] if you have like a smaller head you can
[180 - 183] fold it in like you know a couple three
[183 - 186] inches right there but if you have a
[186 - 188] bigger head like me you can fold it in
[188 - 191] fold it in just a little bit like that
[191 - 193] now do the same on the other side fold
[193 - 198] it up and in like that make a nice
[198 - 200] little crease so now if you're holding
[200 - 202] them because they're gonna try to flap
[202 - 203] out they look like this so this is what
[203 - 207] your back should look like and then just
[207 - 209] like on the front side you're going to
[209 - 212] fold this right up fold this bottom edge
[212 - 215] right up so now it's all and not on the
[215 - 217] same size but on the opposite so on the
[217 - 219] opposite side so now you'll still have
[219 - 221] that little space right in the middle
[221 - 224] and that's a base that your head goes no
[224 - 228] if you start popping it out a little bit
[228 - 230] you're the Apple about it it fits my
[230 - 232] head does it fit your head I got it
[232 - 236] perfect size the one size fits all it's
[236 - 238] supposed to go to the front leg well you
[238 - 239] can do that whichever way you want it to
[239 - 243] be turned that looks really good musics
[243 - 246] great awesome well that's how we make a
[246 - 247] paper right now there are other things
[247 - 250] we can do with this what can we do we
[250 - 252] can put little things in this little in
[252 - 253] the little room in your little brim you
[253 - 255] can have things hanging out and you will
[255 - 260] decorate your hats in fact I'm going to
[260 - 263] add something you have okay I'm gonna
[263 - 266] make it funnier funny hats no no you're
[266 - 271] yo little a nice little I my third
[271 - 273] googly eye there and their way here I
[273 - 275] have another one okay we need to get as
[275 - 277] many eyes as we can right and then
[277 - 280] another googly eye there right now your
[280 - 291] hat has eyes awesome
[302 - 302] alright by the way that is our crafty
[302 - 310] mid cross craft craft

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[7 - 7] hi my name is Laura I'm an artist and
[7 - 8] I'm going to show you how to make a
[8 - 11] three sided paper hat what you're going
[11 - 14] to need is a sheet of paper I have an
[14 - 16] eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper
[16 - 19] it's going to make a small hat so if you
[19 - 21] want to make a larger hat use a larger
[21 - 22] sheet of paper
[22 - 25] so first the first step is you're gonna
[25 - 29] fold the paper in half lengthwise like
[29 - 33] this after you fold it use your
[33 - 38] fingernail to to make that fold sharper
[38 - 42] and then what you're going to do is make
[42 - 44] sure that the folded side is away from
[44 - 49] you the open edges toward you fold the
[49 - 52] upper right and left hand corners in
[52 - 53] toward each other so that they meet in
[53 - 56] the middle and then do a sort of
[56 - 60] temporary temporary fold and then again
[60 - 62] sharpen that with your fingernail on
[62 - 68] both sides and you'll have flaps left
[68 - 70] facing towards you what you're going to
[70 - 76] do is fold one side up on one side
[76 - 79] fingernail it down and then flip it over
[79 - 83] and take that other flap up on the other
[83 - 90] side and then you have one two three
[90 - 95] corners on your hat and you can put it
[95 - 99] on your head like that I am Laura thank

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[2 - 2] hey everybody this is gonna be a
[2 - 5] tutorial on how to make a paper hat so
[5 - 7] the first step is you want to draw three
[7 - 10] shapes that look like this now the first
[10 - 13] shape you draw is gonna have a curve
[13 - 16] right there and then the second one is
[16 - 19] gonna be a little bit less curved but a
[19 - 21] slant going up there but a small slit
[21 - 23] and then the third is going to be the
[23 - 25] smallest piece and the less curved on
[25 - 27] the edge once you have this drawing out
[27 - 28] what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut
[28 - 31] each one out after you cut them out
[31 - 32] you're gonna have three of these and
[32 - 35] you're gonna take one of them put them
[35 - 37] on a white piece of paper and trace
[37 - 39] around because what you're doing is
[39 - 41] you're you're making two of each shape
[41 - 43] and so you're making sure that each one
[43 - 45] is the same size as the one before
[45 - 47] because if it's not the hats not gonna
[47 - 54] fit together correctly and once you have
[54 - 56] all those traced what you're gonna do is
[56 - 58] take some scissors and you're gonna cut
[58 - 63] each one out this is the time to color
[63 - 66] them and if you want to once you have
[66 - 67] them all cut out what you're gonna do is
[67 - 69] you're gonna take one of them and you're
[69 - 71] gonna draw lines like this around the
[71 - 73] edge these represent the seams of the
[73 - 76] Hat and if you want to you can also do a
[76 - 79] dotted line for these instead but you
[79 - 82] can do it however you want and you're
[82 - 88] gonna do that for every single one
[90 - 90] make sure that for these pieces the two
[90 - 92] largest ones the slant is going down on
[92 - 94] that side and going up on that one it's
[94 - 98] almost like a mirror image once you have
[98 - 100] them all drawn on what you're gonna do
[100 - 103] is you're gonna take these to make sure
[103 - 105] it's those two take a piece of tape tape
[105 - 107] on the back and then you're gonna put
[107 - 109] together you are now starting to put the
[109 - 115] Hat together take another piece of tape
[115 - 117] and put it on the back and put them
[117 - 119] together you're gonna be doing this for
[119 - 122] each one just make sure that you don't
[122 - 124] tape too close to the top because when
[124 - 126] you're done sometimes it doesn't fit
[126 - 129] together quite right so you want to make
[129 - 130] sure you have enough room if you need to
[130 - 133] adjust now the next two pieces is you
[133 - 136] want to put ones of the smallest ones on
[136 - 138] one side and the other smallest piece on
[138 - 141] the other side each side has to be
[141 - 142] symmetrical because if you don't put
[142 - 144] them in to get together in the right
[144 - 145] order the hats not going to come out
[145 - 147] right so you have to make sure you're
[147 - 151] doing it in this order and then take
[151 - 154] that other small piece and attach it to
[154 - 173] the other side like that
[175 - 175] now for the two largest pieces which are
[175 - 176] the two lost you have to be careful
[176 - 179] about this make sure that the slants on
[179 - 181] this are going kind of in the mirror
[181 - 184] image again going opposite but then
[184 - 185] after that you just do what you've been
[185 - 187] doing the whole time taping on the back
[187 - 191] and then putting together like this just
[191 - 193] like that just make sure that the slants
[193 - 201] are going the opposite direction
[204 - 204] these two last pieces are usually the
[204 - 206] most difficult to put together because
[206 - 207] everything is a little bit crowded
[207 - 210] because it's making the circular shape
[210 - 214] so it may be a little bit difficult in
[214 - 216] the video you can tell that I'm gonna
[216 - 219] have a little bit of trouble with it but
[219 - 221] it seemed pretty easy to work around but
[221 - 225] just keep taping to the back and then
[225 - 231] putting it together like that and if you
[231 - 233] have a gap at the top that's completely
[233 - 235] fine or if you have a little bit of tape
[235 - 241] left over there don't worry about it and
[241 - 243] if you do have any extra tape up there
[243 - 245] what you can do is just take some
[245 - 247] scissors and cut off the extra tape and
[247 - 248] don't worry about that gap at the top
[248 - 252] because that's gonna be covered up later
[252 - 254] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[254 - 256] take some cardboard make sure it's thin
[256 - 257] cardboard you can use anything you want
[257 - 259] as you can see here I use some Ritz
[259 - 262] cardboard so you can do anything you
[262 - 269] really want make about six tabs like
[269 - 272] that you you actually really only need
[272 - 277] four but um I'm just doing that in case
[277 - 279] I mess out so then take some tape you
[279 - 281] can bend it too it might make it easier
[281 - 283] and then put it in like that and just
[283 - 287] keep taping around the entire hat this
[287 - 288] is to make the Hat more sturdy and it
[288 - 292] also gives the Hat the round shape so
[292 - 294] that if you wear it it won't crumble or
[294 - 297] anything when you put it on and so just
[297 - 299] keep taping around the top and bottom
[299 - 300] make sure they're on there correctly
[300 - 303] make sure they won't fall off and you
[303 - 305] may notice you can see through the white
[305 - 307] hat to the cardboard but that's fine if
[307 - 309] you have your head actually colored in
[309 - 311] right now you um you probably can't even
[311 - 315] see it so it's fine now what you're
[315 - 317] gonna do is you're gonna make the brim
[317 - 319] for that so put the Hat down like that
[319 - 322] and you're gonna make kind of a half
[322 - 328] circle like this yeah and kind of draw
[328 - 331] it in lightly in case you mess up so you
[331 - 333] can erase it and there won't be any left
[333 - 334] over
[334 - 338] marks and once you have it right or how
[338 - 341] you like it just go around and darken it
[341 - 345] back in like that and then put the hat
[346 - 348] back on and you're just gonna make a
[348 - 351] half circle around the edges like this
[351 - 357] and by now which it look like a half
[357 - 361] moon and then just darken it in and then
[361 - 364] once you have it all darken in you're
[364 - 367] gonna cut it out with some scissors and
[367 - 370] this is when you can color the Birman if
[370 - 373] you want to now what we're gonna do is
[373 - 376] you're gonna take some pencil and you're
[376 - 378] gonna draw some lines like this these
[378 - 383] represent the seams of the brim so just
[383 - 389] draw it around like that you can also do
[389 - 392] these dotted lines here instead if you
[392 - 395] want but you can do it any way and just
[395 - 398] keep doing that but before you get to
[398 - 401] the very end about this point stop and
[401 - 406] just leave that area blank in there now
[406 - 407] you're gonna take some cardboard and
[407 - 412] you're gonna trace around the paper it's
[412 - 414] okay if the cardboard is a little bit
[414 - 417] too small as you can see here I have him
[417 - 418] used a little bit too small a piece but
[418 - 420] it's fine just make sure it's not too
[420 - 422] small and then you're gonna cut it out
[422 - 425] because this is gonna make the brim more
[425 - 428] stiff
[430 - 430] and then you're gonna take some glue
[430 - 433] glue the cardboard and then you're just
[433 - 437] gonna put the brim the paper broom onto
[437 - 443] the cardboard
[446 - 446] once you're done with that you can flip
[446 - 449] it over and if you have any writing like
[449 - 453] here and writing like that what you do
[453 - 457] is you trace around and then you cut
[457 - 459] that out and then you're just gonna put
[459 - 460] it over the words or whatever there is
[460 - 462] there so you don't see it and then put
[462 - 464] it down like that and if you can still
[464 - 466] see through you just do it again
[466 - 469] and then you won't be able to see it now
[469 - 470] what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[470 - 473] make sure that shape is the same shape
[473 - 475] you see on the Hat it has to be that
[475 - 478] shape because that's the front tape the
[478 - 487] brim put a few pieces on and tape it to
[487 - 490] the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on
[490 - 499] straight
[502 - 502] now you're gonna fill that gap in so
[502 - 505] take some paper cut out a square
[505 - 511] rectangular shape and you're gonna glue
[511 - 520] the inside of the Hat like this
[523 - 523] and then Pat that down inside and then
[523 - 533] you can't see through anymore like that
[536 - 536] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[536 - 538] make the airholes for that so take some
[538 - 541] paper and draw six circles and put dark
[541 - 545] dots in the middle of each one and then
[545 - 552] cut them out
[554 - 554] once you have them all cut out take some
[554 - 557] glue glue the bottom of them and paste
[557 - 574] them on in these areas on the Hat
[577 - 577] now we're gonna make the very top of the
[577 - 581] Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a
[581 - 584] strip about this big I actually think I
[584 - 587] made it a little bit too long take some
[587 - 590] glue glue the end and make a circle
[590 - 593] shape about this size and glue both ends
[593 - 600] together once you have that done take a
[600 - 602] piece of paper cut out a circle about
[602 - 609] this big take the other piece glue the
[609 - 614] bottom put that on top and then once you
[614 - 619] get that on glue the other side you
[619 - 620] might want to use a little bit more glue
[620 - 622] than I did here and then put that on the
[622 - 627] top right there now this is the point
[627 - 630] when you can put logos on here here here
[630 - 633] I used EC and a bunch of them but you
[633 - 635] can do anything you want and also you
[635 - 637] can go online print this sticker off
[637 - 641] glue the back and put it on the brim to
[641 - 644] give it a more realistic look and there
[644 - 647] you go there's your hat if you have any
[647 - 649] questions you can message me and I'll
[649 - 652] answer anything if you want you can also
[652 - 654] put your video of your hat as a video
[654 - 657] response to this I'd love to see it good
[657 - 659] luck

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[41 - 45] then cut just over that so now we're
[45 - 47] going to fold it into three and then
[47 - 49] we're going to cut off the top and the
[49 - 52] bottom so that there we have four
[52 - 58] separate hats
[61 - 61] now we're going to cut a triangle in the
[61 - 74] top followed by half a triangle
[76 - 76] now we're going to glue the two sides
[76 - 84] together
[90 - 90] thank you for watching and if you'd like
[90 - 91] me to show you how to make the cracker
[91 - 94] from the Hat then you'll find the link
[94 - 102] in the description below bye for now

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

3. Time-stamps
- For video/audio transcripts, copy the exact start_time and end_time (in seconds) that bracket the source text of the item.
- If no timing metadata exists, output null for both.

The transcript with time-stamps (in seconds) is as follows: ```
[2 - 2] all right so today I gotta make it this
[2 - 7] mini seven head and is very simple so
[7 - 10] we're gonna get any size of paper that

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[3 - 3] I'm going to show you how to make this
[3 - 6] fun bowlers hat for Saint Patrick's Day
[6 - 8] or any other occasion for which you
[8 - 10] would need a bowlers hat the first thing
[10 - 11] you're going to need is your newspaper
[11 - 14] base that's done with one that has a
[14 - 17] deep Bowl for the Hat put it out on the
[18 - 20] table you get it as flat as you can
[20 - 23] around the edges and once you have that
[23 - 25] done you're simply going to start
[25 - 29] rolling the edges up and just gonna roll
[29 - 33] all the way around because you're kind
[33 - 36] of preparing this newspaper to be your
[36 - 39] bowlers hat once you've gone around the
[39 - 44] first time go ahead and start taping it
[44 - 47] all the way around you might have to
[47 - 49] take fairly often but you might not it
[49 - 52] depends on your newspaper once you've
[52 - 53] gotten your hat to the point where you
[53 - 57] taped it all up you can look at it and
[57 - 61] see if it's in as close as you want and
[61 - 65] has that bowler hat look to it once you
[65 - 68] have done that you're going to want to
[68 - 71] take tempera paint or any other paint I
[71 - 73] took this tempered paint put it in a big
[73 - 76] paper plate and use the large brush to
[76 - 79] paint the whole hat newspaper is very
[79 - 81] thin paper and it takes a long time to
[81 - 83] dry so you want to make sure your hat is
[83 - 85] completely dry before you start
[85 - 87] decorating it but in the meantime you
[87 - 89] can cut out what you're going to use to
[89 - 94] make your decorations I use simply three
[94 - 96] hearts that I cut out of construction
[96 - 101] paper and I made them the same size so I
[101 - 105] use the first one as a template cut the
[105 - 116] second one and cut the third one
[122 - 122] and for these I covered them with
[122 - 126] Elmer's glue and then I sprinkled green
[126 - 131] glitter on them and let it dry and once
[131 - 135] that was done I put them together three
[135 - 137] hearts with a little dab of glue I'll
[137 - 138] put a little piece of tape that'll give
[138 - 143] you the idea and my shamrock was ready
[143 - 146] to go from my bowlers hat then once my
[146 - 149] hat was dry I started making that other
[149 - 152] decorations for it no there's your
[152 - 154] shamrock to go in the middle of your hat
[154 - 159] I used shamrock confetti and I used
[159 - 163] glitter glue and I just made some
[163 - 165] decorations around the brim of the Hat
[165 - 169] took my Elmer's glue and put on the
[169 - 171] confetti and glued the shamrock to the
[171 - 173] middle with a little piece of confetti
[173 - 175] now you can of course make a bowlers hat
[175 - 178] any color for any occasion but this is
[178 - 183] how I made a st. Patrick's Day bowler
[183 - 187] hat out of newspaper

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats this very
[8 - 10] fun party hat is made out of only three
[10 - 13] pieces of construction paper this is the
[13 - 15] smaller paper the first thing you want
[15 - 21] to do is take the smaller paper and just
[21 - 26] wrap it around your head until it fits
[26 - 32] and tape or staple it nothing to it
[32 - 37] really once you have your hat secured
[37 - 39] might want to take a special pair of
[39 - 42] scissors but the fancy edges and cut
[42 - 44] around the edge so that you have an edge
[44 - 47] that looks like this and you know if you
[47 - 49] don't have the fancy scissors to do this
[49 - 51] kind of an edge you can always just tear
[51 - 54] the paper and that too will give you a
[54 - 57] fancy edge now one thing that you can do
[57 - 60] too before you even cut out your hat
[60 - 63] before you staple it is to leave it open
[63 - 66] and decorate it you might want to write
[66 - 70] happy birthday and crayon or use markers
[70 - 73] or even use glitter and glue once you've
[73 - 75] done that you put your hat together and
[75 - 78] then you want to make this this is the
[78 - 82] fun stuff and it's so easy to make cut
[82 - 84] out a variety of sizes and colors of
[84 - 87] circles and then just start cutting out
[87 - 89] your circle you want to stay fairly
[89 - 92] close to the edge but it does not have
[92 - 95] to be even that's the beauty of it and
[95 - 97] you just keep cutting until you keep
[97 - 101] Spile spiraling around and you have it
[101 - 103] looking like this and then you take the
[103 - 109] center and stretch it as you can see I
[109 - 111] used several pieces of yellow and
[111 - 114] several pieces of purple I started out
[114 - 116] with a large circle with the purple and
[116 - 119] this was a small circle with the yellow
[119 - 122] put them all together staple them at the
[122 - 128] top shook them out and here we go a
[128 - 131] really fun crazy
[131 - 134] happy birthday hat it would work for new
[134 - 136] to
```

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[8 - 11] welcome to Pirates Cove mateys we're
[11 - 13] going to make a very simple pirate hat
[13 - 17] out of a newspaper you know went three
[17 - 19] sheets of newspaper you can use two but
[19 - 22] three sheets gives you a more sturdy hat
[22 - 25] that are two-sided all the way no half
[25 - 27] sheets lay it out in front of you
[27 - 31] sideways with your fold at the front and
[31 - 34] you're going to find the middle and then
[34 - 39] fold it down to the middle not quite
[39 - 43] centered up and down again leaving a
[43 - 45] little bit of space at the top so that
[45 - 48] it's even and then you're simply going
[48 - 52] to take the first three sheets one two
[52 - 64] three and fold them up and crease it
[66 - 66] [Applause]
[66 - 70] turn it over fold up the next three
[70 - 75] sheets and then fasten it I put mine on
[75 - 79] my head and then stapled it right at the
[79 - 81] sides of my head so that it would stay
[81 - 85] on my head and fit you can do that with
[85 - 90] your hat too now you have your base for
[90 - 95] your pirate hat and what I did with mine
[95 - 100] was to use black construction paper to
[100 - 102] cover the front of it but you could also
[102 - 104] use black tempera paint and I stuck it
[104 - 107] down in the Hat band and then I made a
[107 - 110] skull and crossbones and glued it on
[110 - 112] you're going to make a skull and
[112 - 115] crossbones basically you want to make
[115 - 124] kind of a light bulb shape and put the
[124 - 127] two circles for the eyes you're going to
[127 - 130] have your teeth come down again kind of
[130 - 135] to a point and have teeth and your nose
[135 - 145] make them black make your bones
[154 - 154] cut them out glue them on and voila you
[154 - 159] have a pirate's hat pretty simple huh

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

3. Time-stamps
- For video/audio transcripts, copy the exact start_time and end_time (in seconds) that bracket the source text of the item.
- If no timing metadata exists, output null for both.

The transcript with time-stamps (in seconds) is as follows: ```
[21 - 21] decorate your mash a pirate ship using
[21 - 23] acrylic paint you can have lots of fun
[23 - 25] coming up with a really piratey color
[25 - 32] scheme
[36 - 36] the next step is to fold your card in
[36 - 39] half this is going to create the larger
[39 - 42] waves to go around the outside of your
[42 - 45] hat fold it in half and then we're going
[45 - 60] to draw the wave shape along the paper
[63 - 63] this time to make the smaller waves fold
[63 - 66] your paper in half along the long side
[66 - 78] of the paper and then fold it again
[81 - 81] so you'll find this is slightly more
[81 - 83] difficult to cut through because there's
[83 - 87] four layers of card to cut through so
[87 - 88] you may have to be a bit tougher with
[88 - 92] your scissors but it's well worth it
[92 - 94] because the effect is fantastic at the
[94 - 97] end cut the leaves down the center along
[97 - 106] the fold
[108 - 108] if you have a little extra on the bottom
[108 - 110] you could always just sand that off
[110 - 113] using your glue gun run a line of glue
[113 - 119] along the bottom of your boat and then
[119 - 124] securely attaches to the Hat you'll need
[124 - 125] to hold this in place for a few minutes
[125 - 129] just so it sticks securely so it doesn't
[129 - 130] matter if it's completely straight
[130 - 132] because waves are choppy so it just adds
[132 - 135] to the sea effect next we're going to
[135 - 137] attach the waves to the Hat I'm going to
[137 - 139] use a glue gun but you could use a
[139 - 143] stapler Sini's stick lots of glue onto
[143 - 148] your waves and mold it to the shape of
[148 - 153] the Hat holding it firmly you might need
[153 - 156] to cut your waves to size so it fits
[156 - 163] around the Hat it doesn't matter if it
[163 - 165] overlaps a little bit because the other
[165 - 166] waves are going to go around the edge
[166 - 169] next we're going to attach our smaller
[169 - 174] waves around the edge of the Hat we're
[174 - 175] going to use exactly the same processes
[175 - 180] the larger waves gluing just over the
[180 - 185] top to give this layered effect you will
[185 - 187] need an adult's help with the glue gun
[187 - 189] because it does get very hot I'm going
[189 - 195] to add some treasure to my bonnet you
[195 - 196] can put it wherever you fancy so it
[196 - 199] could be around the boat or it could be
[199 - 200] at the bottom of the ocean it's
[200 - 204] completely up to you and firmly place
[204 - 208] the coins onto the Hat
[208 - 210] if you have any overlapping sections in
[210 - 212] your waves you could always put one of
[212 - 217] the coins over the top so when you stuck
[217 - 218] on your coins
[218 - 221] it obviously adds some sparkle to your
[221 - 228] hat we're going to add the bunting so
[228 - 230] you can attach this however you like you
[230 - 231] could use as little or as much as you
[231 - 233] like so I'm going to attach it the top
[233 - 238] just with a little blob of glue and you
[238 - 241] can cut off any excess just adds the
[241 - 260] finishing touches to your pirate ship

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[120 - 123] dries pop the balloon so that you get
[123 - 127] this dome-like shape now take a chart
[127 - 129] paper and place the dome on it in the
[129 - 133] center and Mark points then take a plate
[133 - 135] and draw a circle connecting these
[135 - 139] points then draw a smaller circle inside
[139 - 142] the circle and then a bigger on the
[142 - 146] outside
[149 - 149] so now we have one small one medium and
[149 - 151] one big circle out of which the medium
[151 - 154] one is exactly the size of the dome now
[154 - 162] cut out the circle
[173 - 173] [Music]
[173 - 177] then from the inside circle cut slits to
[177 - 180] the middle circle
[188 - 188] now fold the paper like so
[188 - 195] [Music]
[198 - 198] so take the gnome and cut slits on that
[198 - 204] as well and fold them outwards
[222 - 222] the apply glue on these little portions
[222 - 225] and then place the chart paper on it and
[225 - 232] stick it well
[234 - 234] [Music]
[234 - 237] then apply glue on these little portions
[237 - 239] of the chart paper and stick it on the
[239 - 243] dome
[250 - 250] [Music]
[250 - 253] once that is done leave it to dry
[253 - 258] overnight so that the dome hardens then
[258 - 260] paint it with your favourite colour I
[260 - 262] chose this bright yellow color
[262 - 265] make sure to paint the side as well as
[265 - 268] even this will be showing then apply
[268 - 272] glue on the edges of the dome
[286 - 286] tie a bow on one side and that's it your
[286 - 291] hat is ready so that was my DIY paper

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

- For video/audio transcripts, copy the exact start_time and end_time (in seconds) that bracket the source text of the item.
- If no timing metadata exists, output null for both.

The transcript with time-stamps (in seconds) is as follows: ```
[2 - 2] in this clip I'm going to show you how
[2 - 5] to make a paper top hat you're gonna
[5 - 8] take a piece of paper a paper plate here
[8 - 10] you can take your scissors and you're
[10 - 12] going to cut out the middle by carefully
[12 - 15] poking the scissors through the top and
[15 - 19] cutting leaving a little bit of the
[19 - 23] paper plate on the top and notice that I
[23 - 26] turned the paper plate over or upside
[26 - 31] down I quickly cut that out all the way
[31 - 34] around and then I'm going to take just a
[34 - 37] regular piece of construction paper and
[37 - 39] I'm going to fold down the top just a
[39 - 42] little bit to give it some sturdy nuts
[42 - 46] because I want it to really hold
[46 - 48] together well I'm gonna put a glue stick
[48 - 53] on here pull that down and then I'm
[53 - 56] going to also fold up the bottom about a
[56 - 58] half of an inch and this is going to
[58 - 65] allow the paper top-hat to fit inside of
[65 - 66] the paper plate and I'm going to cut
[66 - 69] little slits around here which will help
[69 - 75] mold it into a circle okay the last
[75 - 76] thing I want to do is I want to overlap
[76 - 78] these so I'm going to put a little bit
[78 - 80] of glue here and I'm going to go ahead
[80 - 87] and put these two together like that and
[87 - 91] there take a piece of tape and put this
[91 - 93] right in the middle where I'm
[93 - 96] overlapping it just to support it a
[96 - 98] little bit now I'm going to put this
[98 - 102] right inside of my paper plate and I'm
[102 - 104] going to turn it upside down and I'm
[104 - 108] going to start gluing these tabs onto
[108 - 112] the paper plate just like you see here
[112 - 115] and I'm going to go ahead and show you
[115 - 118] that this last one and I want to support
[118 - 122] it again with a piece of tape and the
[122 - 125] very last thing I'm going to do is I'm
[125 - 128] going to take my magic marker and I'm
[128 - 130] going to go ahead and make that brim
[130 - 135] black and you have a great top hat

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[3 - 3] hi in this video I'm going to show you
[3 - 6] how you can create an imaginative Easter
[6 - 8] bonnet with your child using simple
[8 - 12] paper mache techniques first of all you
[12 - 15] need a balloon if you're making
[15 - 17] something like this out of an egg shape
[17 - 20] or if you want to make an animal or a
[20 - 23] bird you'll need a small balloon for the
[23 - 26] head and a larger balloon for the body
[26 - 33] so first of all you need to inflate the
[33 - 36] large balloon sit it in a saucepan or
[36 - 40] bowl so it sits securely while you're
[40 - 44] applying the strips of newspaper I've
[44 - 48] cut mine into 1 by 5 inch strips but you
[48 - 50] don't have to be approximate that's only
[50 - 52] approximate you don't have to do it
[52 - 55] exactly the other thing you'll need is a
[55 - 58] pot of PVA glue which has some water in
[58 - 60] so it's running and you'll need a
[60 - 63] paintbrush and your meal apron that will
[63 - 65] cover your child because it can get
[65 - 69] messy so what I recommend is that you
[69 - 71] get your child to cover an area of the
[71 - 75] balloon with glue and I'll show you that
[75 - 79] it should just run on the balloon quite
[79 - 82] easily and then when you've covered an
[82 - 86] area the balloon in PVA close then apply
[86 - 89] strips running in the same direction all
[89 - 95] around the balloon then apply another
[95 - 98] another layer of glue put on the strip's
[98 - 101] going in the opposite direction
[101 - 103] overlapping slightly so there are no
[103 - 107] gaps and then your third layer will go
[108 - 110] back to the original direction and then
[110 - 112] I recommend that for the final layer you
[112 - 116] apply some kitchen towel strips or some
[116 - 118] paper to have strips and because this
[119 - 122] provides a really good base for
[122 - 126] painting it helps it make sure that the
[126 - 128] print doesn't show through or it
[128 - 130] provides a good base if you're wanting
[130 - 135] to put squares of tissue paper onto the
[135 - 139] balloon so after about 24 hours in a
[139 - 142] really warm place your balloon will
[142 - 146] hopefully dry so that it's it's it's
[146 - 154] very solid pop the balloon and cut up a
[154 - 157] circular hole in the bottom large enough
[157 - 161] for the top of the Hat it should should
[161 - 164] fit securely on and then if you're
[164 - 166] wanting to make an Easter basket like
[166 - 169] this all you have to do is is cut a
[169 - 173] section out of each side leaving a
[173 - 175] handle shape down the middle and then
[175 - 177] your child could fill it with things
[177 - 180] that they've made here I've got homemade
[180 - 184] daffodils and decoupage eggs and some
[184 - 187] tissue paper shred or if you're
[187 - 191] interested in making one of the animals
[191 - 197] then your your need and some tissue
[197 - 200] paper shred for their for their fur or
[200 - 204] for their coat now to help you to sit
[204 - 206] the head on top of the body what I
[206 - 209] recommend is that you have used some
[209 - 211] duct tape to make some crisscross shapes
[211 - 214] at the bottom of the head and stick that
[214 - 216] on top of the body so that it's secure
[216 - 218] because what you don't want is for the
[218 - 221] kids to fall off during the Easter
[221 - 228] bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you
[228 - 230] there were three kits available there's
[230 - 233] a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and
[233 - 235] there's a lamb kit and
[236 - 238] come with all materials that you'll need
[238 - 241] to make an Easter bonnet as well as the
[241 - 244] bonnet and a list of instructions to
[244 - 246] help you go through it step by step but
[246 - 248] if you have any questions or any ideas
[248 - 250] that you want to discuss please get in
[250 - 254] touch thank you for watching

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[6 - 6] some of you might be wondering why I'm
[6 - 9] dressed up well it's my birthday happy
[9 - 15] birthday to me happy birthday to me
[15 - 22] happy birthday to that girl Tyson happy
[22 - 26] birthday to me that's right
[26 - 29] today is my birthday November 30th
[29 - 32] that is the day I was brought forth into
[32 - 34] this world which is also why I'm all
[34 - 37] dolled up I'm even wearing a party dress
[37 - 39] party dress and I put something in my
[39 - 42] hair it's a hairband and I have makeup
[42 - 43] on which actually feels really
[43 - 44] uncomfortable because I don't really
[44 - 46] wear makeup now because I dismembered
[46 - 48] Thanos all about fun and festivities and
[48 - 50] cake and presents well actually I had no
[50 - 53] fun or festivities plan but I think
[53 - 54] there will be cake and hopefully a
[54 - 57] present or two I have decided to make a
[57 - 59] party hat that's right we are going to
[59 - 61] make a party hat it's arts and crafts
[61 - 63] I'm here at that Colonel Tyson I know
[63 - 66] you all are so excited so without
[66 - 68] further ado let's make a party hat to
[68 - 69] make this project you're gonna need a
[69 - 70] piece of paper
[70 - 72] I chose bread so much is my Percy pretty
[72 - 77] dress and scissors tape glue and
[77 - 79] something to decorate your party hat
[79 - 81] with first you're gonna need to make a
[81 - 84] complete square out of your construction
[84 - 87] paper then you're gonna make your hat
[87 - 89] all you have to do is roll your piece of
[89 - 91] paper into a cone now to do that you
[91 - 96] just roll your paper you're going to
[96 - 101] tape it ever notice how that first piece
[101 - 105] of tape just never feels right now
[105 - 109] you're gonna cut it this paper off I'm
[109 - 111] not the best hat maker and I'm just
[111 - 114] winging it cuz once you have your cowan
[114 - 123] you decorate it
[125 - 125] now I suggest using stickers as well
[125 - 127] especially letter stickers and if you
[127 - 130] were having a birthday party and there
[130 - 131] were a bunch of different kids you could
[131 - 133] put their names on them which is kind of
[133 - 136] cool and certain stickers will add your
[136 - 139] own unique flair to your hat I think
[139 - 140] this is great for birthday parties and
[140 - 142] if I ever have kids it's totally
[142 - 144] something I would do it has some of
[144 - 147] these steampunk ears that I'm going to
[147 - 150] put on my hat okay cool
[150 - 157] Naomi I'm all about being cool
[159 - 159] and now I'm going to put my name on it
[159 - 160] you know so what the other partygoers
[161 - 163] know who I am awesome
[163 - 165] now you just let you have dry for a few
[165 - 170] minutes and of course you have to ensure
[170 - 172] that it was going to stay on your head
[172 - 174] so the best way to do that is to get
[174 - 180] some string or some elastic and thread
[180 - 182] the elastic through for some strange
[182 - 184] reason I cannot find my string and so
[184 - 188] I'm going to use party ribbon and voila
[188 - 191] you have a super awesome personalized
[191 - 195] party hat let me just add my party hat
[195 - 201] onto my head alright here I am what do
[201 - 204] you think I bet you know you will never
[204 - 207] ever buy another party hat because it's
[207 - 210] so simple to make and they look amazing
[210 - 212] talent arts and crafts time is over
[212 - 214] I'm gonna go ahead and say goodbye I
[214 - 215] hope you all have a fabulous day and
[215 - 217] I'll see you all again here next week
[217 - 228] for another edition of back melted and
[228 - 231] then of course you just clean up by
[231 - 234] shoving it all in your desk like this
[234 - 238] and closing it

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

[8 - 8] hello and welcome back to the insane
[8 - 10] knitters the YouTube video channel this
[10 - 14] is going to be a demonstration of a flat
[14 - 16] hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a
[16 - 19] lot of hats are knit in the round on a
[19 - 21] cable needle and they they're you know
[21 - 23] you just knit them in a circle and then
[23 - 25] you decrease to the top and you finish
[25 - 27] it that way a flat hat is knit on
[27 - 30] straight needles like this with just a
[30 - 33] large piece of fabric and a lot of
[33 - 35] people make hats this way it does
[35 - 37] involve some seaming and I'll show you
[37 - 41] that but what I'm using here is really
[41 - 43] big needles and really thick yarn this
[43 - 47] is called encore mega and on a size 15
[47 - 48] needle it gives you two stitches per
[48 - 51] inch and that's just something I'm using
[51 - 54] right now and I'll tell you why it makes
[54 - 56] a quick it's a very quick knit just
[56 - 59] quick quick turn it up and it it's very
[59 - 61] thick and you only generally need one
[61 - 64] skein to do this you can use two it
[64 - 67] tells you on the label
[67 - 70] how many yards it is and it's this is
[71 - 73] sixty four yards on and I'm using a
[73 - 76] smaller needle than it calls for so I'm
[76 - 77] getting a little more yardage out of
[77 - 80] this to knit with but that's neither
[80 - 81] here nor there you can use any yarn you
[81 - 83] want for this I'm just using the thick
[83 - 85] yarn and the big needles too to show you
[85 - 88] because it's easier um when you want to
[88 - 90] make a flat hat uh
[90 - 93] like I said you is a thick skein of yarn
[93 - 95] to give me about two stitches per inch
[95 - 98] because it's it's a quick knit and I
[98 - 101] find it easier but you can do this with
[101 - 102] baby yarn you can do this with any yarn
[102 - 105] you want as long as you measure properly
[105 - 107] and that is really the thing you want to
[107 - 110] cast on enough stitches on your needles
[110 - 115] to make the length as high as you want
[115 - 118] the hat to be so if you need the Hat to
[118 - 121] be 10 inches high you know so you've got
[121 - 123] good six inches of coverage on your hat
[123 - 126] then you want to cast on enough stitches
[126 - 131] because this is going to be however
[131 - 134] however why it is is going to be how it
[134 - 138] sits on your head so and then you want
[138 - 141] to knit - however you however long you
[141 - 143] want it to be around generally the most
[143 - 146] average hat is the average person's head
[146 - 149] is about 20 to 22 inches you know the
[149 - 151] kids are obviously smaller than that and
[151 - 153] people come in different sizes so you
[153 - 157] just want to knit as long as you want
[157 - 159] your hat to be around and I'll show you
[159 - 163] why what I have done here is I've knit
[163 - 165] to the point to where I want to bind off
[165 - 168] okay I think this is about 12 inches so
[168 - 170] it's going to make a small hat and now
[170 - 172] I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go
[172 - 173] ahead and do that and I'll come back in
[173 - 175] a minute when I'm bound off and I'll
[175 - 177] show you what and we're back
[177 - 179] okay I have bound off this piece of
[179 - 182] fabric to the last stitch and I'll show
[182 - 185] you what to do now
[185 - 188] we've got our last stitch here and you
[188 - 192] want to finish that up no but you want
[193 - 194] it the thing is is we're going to seam
[194 - 196] this now so you want to instead of just
[196 - 198] cutting this off really close and
[198 - 200] binding it off that way you want to
[200 - 205] leave a long piece long piece of tail
[205 - 206] yarn here because we're going to use
[206 - 210] this piece to sew up the Hat so you want
[210 - 213] to leave really long tail to sew with so
[213 - 217] okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much
[217 - 224] okay and then we're gonna cut this
[226 - 226] and then we're gonna pull it through
[226 - 229] okay so there we go that's our last
[229 - 231] stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn
[231 - 234] through and we're gonna there we go now
[234 - 236] we're bound off completely here okay
[236 - 239] there we go now this is the piece of
[239 - 243] fabric that I knitted and what we're
[243 - 246] going to do is we're going to take a
[246 - 250] yarn needle if you don't have a yarn
[250 - 253] needle they come in various kinds this
[253 - 255] is a large one so because I'm using
[255 - 262] really big yarn here this is the piece I
[262 - 265] knitted okay here's the the cast on edge
[265 - 267] this is where I started knitting and
[268 - 270] then I knit it however long I want my
[270 - 273] hat to be generally this one's about 12
[273 - 278] inches and but you know like I said
[278 - 282] normally you'd knit however long two to
[282 - 284] make it or whoever you're knitting it
[284 - 287] for measuring heads is kind of weird but
[287 - 291] you can do it just you know or you can
[291 - 292] take your best guess like I said the
[292 - 295] average hat the average size is about 20
[295 - 299] to 22 inches depending on on the person
[299 - 303] you're knitting for so here's our our
[303 - 305] cast on edge this is where we started
[305 - 307] Inc this is our cast off edge where we
[307 - 309] stop knitting and this is what we're
[309 - 313] going to do we're going to sew the cast
[313 - 314] on edge
[314 - 317] to the cast-off edge the bind off and
[317 - 320] the bind on we're going to sew those
[320 - 321] together and you're going to end up with
[321 - 324] this two looking thing okay like that so
[324 - 327] you want to take your really long tail
[327 - 330] that you left you also can use another
[330 - 334] piece of yarn to do this you know just
[334 - 336] if you want you can use a different size
[336 - 339] of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I
[339 - 341] used to sew the Hat so that way it
[341 - 347] doesn't show if it gets pulled apart
[347 - 348] okay so here we are we have our yarn
[348 - 353] needle and our yarn and we're going to
[353 - 357] sew these edges together now you can see
[357 - 359] here where your yarn where you bound off
[359 - 361] right there and then you can see the
[361 - 364] edge over here so I generally oh and
[364 - 365] then that's another thing to see this
[365 - 366] pattern I just this is garter stitch
[366 - 368] it's just all knit stitches it's nice
[368 - 370] for hats it's thick it's comfortable but
[370 - 372] you can use any pattern you want you
[372 - 374] don't have to be you don't have to use
[374 - 375] garter stitch I know someone who does
[376 - 377] these in ribbing you can do it every
[377 - 381] pattern you want just remember that one
[381 - 383] side will be inside on the person's head
[383 - 385] and the other side will be on the
[385 - 387] outside so just keep that in mind with
[387 - 389] your pattern but this is just simple
[389 - 390] garter stitch it's all it's knit every
[390 - 392] row just because it works for
[392 - 395] demonstration purposes and also it helps
[395 - 399] me line up what I'm doing here so see
[399 - 400] there's I'm lining up the little rows
[400 - 404] there and now you just take your yarn
[404 - 411] needle and you pick up in between the
[411 - 413] bind off stitches there's these little
[413 - 417] ladders see those right in between each
[417 - 420] of these stitches you can go in and pick
[420 - 423] up that little that little ladder inside
[423 - 426] in it and that really helps you a lot
[426 - 428] when you're sewing and so what we're
[428 - 431] going to do is just seam all the way
[431 - 433] across or I'll show you a couple
[433 - 435] stitches how I do it there's lots of
[435 - 438] ways to do this but this is how I do it
[438 - 441] and so I just come over and I pick up
[441 - 446] the corner first just to secure that
[446 - 452] just to secure them together okay so now
[452 - 454] they're there they're secured they're
[454 - 457] sewn together and then I come in and I
[457 - 463] pick up both sides sorry I bump the
[463 - 465] camera pick up both sides of this stitch
[465 - 470] and both sides of this one and pull that
[470 - 474] through there we go that's sewn together
[474 - 476] this making a flat hat does make a big
[476 - 479] seam down the side and that can be
[479 - 480] uncomfortable for some people when they
[480 - 485] wear stuff but it's just a side effect
[485 - 487] of what this pattern you know of making
[487 - 490] a flat hat so and then that's it I just
[490 - 493] go back and forth I cut this is called
[493 - 495] kind of a whip stitch you just go back
[495 - 500] and forth and sew it up all the way up
[500 - 502] up the sides and you want to make sure
[502 - 506] that you get just about every stitch so
[506 - 510] that way you don't have big holes when
[510 - 514] you when the person puts this hat on so
[514 - 517] see I'm picking up both legs of this
[517 - 520] stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm
[520 - 526] just coming through just like this okay
[526 - 528] and you see how that's being seamed
[528 - 531] together there it's making this little
[531 - 535] making this little line down there down
[535 - 537] the Knitting I'll show you what to do
[537 - 546] with that in a minute so there we go
[548 - 548] see that's another reason I like to use
[548 - 551] the same color of yarn because this way
[551 - 557] it doesn't show very very much
[559 - 559] see when you can tell there's a scene
[559 - 561] there but you can't really see where the
[561 - 564] yarn is because I use the same yarn now
[564 - 565] if I used a different color you could
[565 - 569] really see so pick up both legs of that
[569 - 573] stitch and both legs of the next one and
[573 - 576] come come through
[576 - 579] and I will see you in a minute when I
[579 - 581] get this seemed up in Italy
[581 - 583] okay I'm back I've got this all seem
[583 - 586] down the side now okay
[586 - 587] so now I have this tube see this tube
[587 - 590] thing it's a it's like a it's a tube
[590 - 594] okay and it's not a hat yet but it will
[594 - 596] be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last
[596 - 600] stitch here just like that this is a
[600 - 602] little tail where we started to knit
[602 - 605] remember now this is the part where you
[605 - 607] make your hat okay you're going to
[607 - 611] basically stitch up one of the one of
[611 - 615] the sides here and that's going to close
[615 - 618] one end of the tube and kind of make a
[618 - 621] little hat shape like this okay like
[621 - 623] that so it doesn't look like a hat now
[623 - 625] but when I get this all sewn and I pull
[625 - 628] it really tight it'll make a little hat
[628 - 630] like that and you said you know it's not
[630 - 632] the prettiest thing in the world but it
[632 - 634] does work very well and then you can
[634 - 638] fold this up and and you have a hat for
[638 - 642] whomever you're making it for this is
[642 - 646] the part where their head goes in there
[646 - 649] you go you can fold that up and there's
[649 - 651] the top of the hat so that's how you
[651 - 653] make a flat hat so let's go I'll come
[653 - 655] back just a minute when I get this top
[655 - 658] zone and it's over the top you're going
[658 - 660] to instead of going back and forth like
[660 - 663] we did with this loose with the whip
[663 - 665] stitching you're kind of going to do the
[665 - 667] same thing only you do it on both sides
[668 - 670] so there's where I came out so I'm going
[670 - 673] to go in here like that
[673 - 675] pick up that because this is a different
[675 - 677] edge so it's going to look a little a
[677 - 680] little different because this is a side
[680 - 682] now instead of the bind off edge so
[682 - 684] you're going to go so you came out here
[684 - 686] and then you're going to go back on this
[686 - 689] side and over here like that you make in
[689 - 692] kind of a criss cross one two three four
[692 - 693] instead of going back and forth like
[693 - 698] that so you just go just like this and
[698 - 700] I'll see you in just a second when I get
[700 - 701] this done
[701 - 703] okay I've reached the last stitch now
[703 - 705] and these these are all stitched and I
[705 - 706] went back and forth back and forth and
[706 - 708] now I'm at the last stitch I'm going to
[708 - 711] pull it through and you didn't you don't
[711 - 712] want to seen this too tightly because
[712 - 714] this is what you're going to do now now
[714 - 717] you're gonna pull see you pull that
[717 - 719] really tight like that and see how it
[719 - 722] squishes like that okay you pull it
[722 - 723] really tight and then what I do is I
[723 - 727] take my needle and I just kind of wedge
[727 - 731] it through again just just because guess
[731 - 734] that little gives it a little extra
[734 - 738] tightening okay just like that and you
[738 - 740] can do it again if you want just to use
[740 - 743] up some of the slack on your on your
[743 - 745] needle there or some of the extra yarn
[745 - 748] okay there you go and you know one more
[748 - 752] time why not we're here so there you go
[752 - 755] you pull it tight now you weave in your
[755 - 760] ends
[762 - 762] there's an end and then you pull it
[762 - 765] inside out and there you go you have a
[765 - 770] hat here just a flat hat
[775 - 775] tada you made a hat yay Congrats
[775 - 778] here's your flat head with your ins bulb
[778 - 781] in and there's the broom you can roll it
[781 - 782] up or they can just wear it straight
[782 - 785] they want but there it is
[785 - 789] and that's what the top looks like
[790 - 790] like I said it's not the prettiest thing
[790 - 792] in the world but it's good it's
[792 - 793] functional and you can use whatever
[793 - 798] pattern you want and in it however you
[798 - 798] like
[798 - 802] there you go but

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

From a tutorial-style transcript (recipe, SOP, repair guide, etc.) extract all task-relevant information. Work strictly in the order below.

1. Detect task-relevant information
- Parse the transcript clause-by-clause.
- Create one piece for each indivisible action, object, reason, or tip.
    - Indivisible = removing any word breaks the meaning.
- If a sentence contains multiple actions (`whisk, then fold`) or multiple rationales, split them.
- Rewrite each piece so it is understandable standing alone窶馬o dangling `it`,`they`, `this step`, etc.
Examples:
- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s, then fold in the flour.` -> `Whisk the eggs for 30 seconds.` `Fold the eggs in the flour.`
- `Let the paint dry so it won't smudge.` -> `Let the paint dry.` (method) `Drying the paint prevents smudging.` (explanation)
- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and mix well.` -> `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture.` `Mix beaten eggs well.`
- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and stir until thoroughly combined.` -> `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` `Stir white chocolate chips until thoroughly combined.`

2. Assign `type` and `subtype` to each piece according to below taxonomy:

3. Time-stamps
- For video/audio transcripts, copy the exact start_time and end_time (in seconds) that bracket the source text of the item.
- If no timing metadata exists, output null for both.

The transcript with time-stamps (in seconds) is as follows: ```
[4 - 4] all right okay a nother paper hell - now
[4 - 7] we're going to be making a paper hat and
[7 - 11] do so you will first need to fold the
[11 - 19] paper in half doesn't have to be too
[19 - 25] accurate fold it in half now this bit
[25 - 29] you have to fold over the top half okay
[29 - 34] so that's the middle of the paper you
[34 - 37] can fold it in half gainer sheep just to
[37 - 41] make 9 down the middle that you can see
[41 - 42] okay
[42 - 48] so fold over these top these top pieces
[48 - 56] okay it like you would a paper airplane
[56 - 71] I guess to make this paper hat and it's
[72 - 76] quite a simple thing paper they go what
[76 - 81] more do you need to do opens up how I
[81 - 85] fill it with chips or whatever if you
[85 - 89] want make it look a little neater you

[101 - 111] the same on the other side and then
[111 - 116] triangle isn't your style you can then
[116 - 119] fold it down
[119 - 124] and push it in to the little flap there
[124 - 128] and then you have more of a boat shape
[128 - 131] and if you want to make a paper boat
[131 - 134] make a paper boat call it paper boat say
[134 - 136] that's paper foam instead of paper paper
[136 - 142] boat paper paper boat and it also
[142 - 144] doubles up a third thing you put out
[144 - 149] just fold in one of the corners

[11 - 11] you can use the technique I'm going to
[11 - 15] show you to make a top hat of any size I
[15 - 19] used a cardboard tube but you can use
[19 - 23] construction paper our poster board are
[23 - 26] any material that is stiff enough now I
[26 - 31] started by drawing around the cardboard
[31 - 38] tube at the bottom then I added some
[38 - 44] tabs so that I can glue it onto the two
[44 - 53] after I cut it out it looks like this i
[66 - 66] i glue them on first so later I can
[66 - 71] cover up the tabs takes a few minutes
[71 - 81] sometimes for the glue to dry
[84 - 84] and while we're waiting for that I drew
[84 - 87] around the bottom the same way i placed
[87 - 93] the tube and it's drew a circle around
[93 - 98] it then for the brim I drew a bigger
[98 - 108] circle around that
[111 - 111] and I cut the circle out and in the
[111 - 116] middle I just made a big X I'll show you
[116 - 121] I made a big X like this and I cut on
[121 - 126] those lines so that it looks like that
[126 - 132] did I bending up and the glue goes on
[132 - 140] the inside of these little triangles so
[140 - 143] that you can I mean I'm sorry little bit
[143 - 147] outside because they're going to be
[147 - 153] placed on the inside of the tube put
[153 - 158] those in take your finger and press them
[158 - 164] so that they blew on then the next thing
[164 - 169] idea that I measured this the tube and I
[169 - 172] r is a paper around it to cover it up
[172 - 176] next I cut the little band and it's just
[176 - 178] a little rectangle and you can make it
[178 - 180] as wide or as narrow as you want and
[180 - 184] then I cut strips to make the stripes
[184 - 187] and I put those on before I glued the
[187 - 190] bad don't and i added stars and glitter
[190 - 193] you may not want to but it's up to you
[193 - 195] it sure as you can make it any way you
[195 - 198] want now thanks for watching remember
[198 - 201] always be kind and please click the
