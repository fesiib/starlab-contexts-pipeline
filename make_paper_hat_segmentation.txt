You are a helpful assistant who can reliably and precisely describe task contexts where pieces of information apply.
ROLE: user

You are given information pieces from tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat. Identify a set of aspects of a task context (a particular temporal segmentation) that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces.

### INPUTS
Information 1: Paint the hats with the preschool class tomorrow.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```to go let's see okay so we're done with the hats the only thing left to do is to paint them and make them colorful so tomorrow we're going to paint them with their preschool class and it should be a lot of fun right okay so see you```
Information 2: Estimate slit length; around three inches (about seven centimeters) is fine.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```centimeters or eight inches or something like that eight and a half inches it's a square so both sides are the same length okay then the top of my square I cut two slits again I just kind of estimating it's not being a very good in the crafter so it's like three inches about or seven centimeters obviously it's not super duper important how big it is because I just asked me to indicate myself anyways okay so you have your three slits cut```
Information 3: Fold the top sheet at the bottom open end upward and over the flaps you folded down.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```the Hat experiment to find the right sized paper step 2 arranged the folded paper in front of you so that the fold is at the top and the opening is at the bottom step 3 fold the two top corners to the middle of the paper so that you form a point on top step 4 fold the top sheet at the bottom open end upward and over the flaps you folded down double the fold and then turn the hat over to fold the other side step 5 punch holes in either side of the hat thread an elastic cord through the holes```


### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
1. Identify at least one aspect of a task context that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces. You can list multiple aspects if you can, but make sure they are orthogonal (i.e., do not overlap with respect to type).
2. Classify which type of aspect it belongs to ("when", "why", "where", "what", or "how").
3. Briefly justify the choice of the aspect and the type of segmentation.
4. Describe how the task can be segmented or divided along this aspect.  
5. Provide brief "guidelines" that explain how to identify segment boundaries or assign labels based on the transcript of a tutorial. 
6. Provide a few examples of "segment labels".

### ANNOTATION GUIDELINES
- Use only the transcript text to infer the distinction.
- Keep aspect titles short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).
- Keep example segment labels short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).

MESSAGES: ROLE: system
You are a helpful assistant who can reliably and precisely describe task contexts where pieces of information apply.
ROLE: user

You are given information pieces from tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat. Identify a set of aspects of a task context (a particular temporal segmentation) that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces.

### INPUTS
Information 1: Get a newspaper.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```hate you today i teach you how to make a paper hat out of a newspaper so here we go there's five steps to do here we go step one you get your shiny newspaper as so my newspaper is conex East garland news how interesting you get a newspaper and you fold in her which is pretty easy because newspapers for like that enemies```
Information 2: You can use the long tail you left or a separate piece of yarn to seam the hat.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```going to do we're going to sew the cast on edge to the cast-off edge the bind off and the bind on we're going to sew those together and you're going to end up with this two looking thing okay like that so you want to take your really long tail that you left you also can use another piece of yarn to do this you know just if you want you can use a different size of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I used to sew the Hat so that way it doesn't show if it gets pulled apart okay so here we are we have our yarn```
Information 3: Have a meal apron to cover the child because the activity can get messy.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```don't have to be approximate that's only approximate you don't have to do it exactly the other thing you'll need is a pot of PVA glue which has some water in so it's running and you'll need a paintbrush and your meal apron that will cover your child because it can get messy so what I recommend is that you get your child to cover an area of the balloon with glue and I'll show you that it should just run on the balloon quite```


### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
1. Identify at least one aspect of a task context that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces. You can list multiple aspects if you can, but make sure they are orthogonal (i.e., do not overlap with respect to type).
2. Classify which type of aspect it belongs to ("when", "why", "where", "what", or "how").
3. Briefly justify the choice of the aspect and the type of segmentation.
4. Describe how the task can be segmented or divided along this aspect.  
5. Provide brief "guidelines" that explain how to identify segment boundaries or assign labels based on the transcript of a tutorial. 
6. Provide a few examples of "segment labels".

### ANNOTATION GUIDELINES
- Use only the transcript text to infer the distinction.
- Keep aspect titles short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).
- Keep example segment labels short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).

MESSAGES: ROLE: system
You are a helpful assistant who can reliably and precisely describe task contexts where pieces of information apply.
ROLE: user

You are given information pieces from tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat. Identify a set of aspects of a task context (a particular temporal segmentation) that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces.

### INPUTS
Information 1: Verify that you have eight segments now.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```and flip into half monkey this Kalish you've got eight segments now so you're gonna foot down one two three down and then you're gonna```
Information 2: Newspaper is very thin paper and it takes a long time to dry.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```has that bowler hat look to it once you have done that you're going to want to take tempera paint or any other paint I took this tempered paint put it in a big paper plate and use the large brush to paint the whole hat newspaper is very thin paper and it takes a long time to dry so you want to make sure your hat is completely dry before you start decorating it but in the meantime you can cut out what you're going to use to make your decorations I use simply three```
Information 3: One person had a black hat and a white veil to coordinate the bride's look.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```it on my sail material and dock it in the back so it would come out of the back of our thing and I put a few layers that are always anyway so that's how we run around the what the bride had a black hat and had a white veil and it was super funny and cute and easy and everyone loves them isn't that right Winston everyone loved```


### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
1. Identify at least one aspect of a task context that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces. You can list multiple aspects if you can, but make sure they are orthogonal (i.e., do not overlap with respect to type).
2. Classify which type of aspect it belongs to ("when", "why", "where", "what", or "how").
3. Briefly justify the choice of the aspect and the type of segmentation.
4. Describe how the task can be segmented or divided along this aspect.  
5. Provide brief "guidelines" that explain how to identify segment boundaries or assign labels based on the transcript of a tutorial. 
6. Provide a few examples of "segment labels".

### ANNOTATION GUIDELINES
- Use only the transcript text to infer the distinction.
- Keep aspect titles short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).
- Keep example segment labels short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).

MESSAGES: ROLE: system
You are a helpful assistant who can reliably and precisely describe task contexts where pieces of information apply.
ROLE: user

You are given information pieces from tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat. Identify a set of aspects of a task context (a particular temporal segmentation) that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces.

### INPUTS
Information 1: My head is 24 inches.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```using a twenty by thirty inch piece of paper and I'm going to fold it into four making four hats let's speed this up a bit my head is 24 inches so that's the measurement I'm going to use for my hats my head's quite big so now we're going to measure 24 inches along the paper and then cut just over that so now we're```
Information 2: Explain that kitchen towel or paper towel strips provide a really good base for painting.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```overlapping slightly so there are no gaps and then your third layer will go back to the original direction and then I recommend that for the final layer you apply some kitchen towel strips or some paper to have strips and because this provides a really good base for painting it helps it make sure that the print doesn't show through or it provides a good base if you're wanting to put squares of tissue paper onto the```
Information 3: Do not worry about the gap at the top because it will be covered later.

### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
1. Identify at least one aspect of a task context that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces. You can list multiple aspects if you can, but make sure they are orthogonal (i.e., do not overlap with respect to type).
2. Classify which type of aspect it belongs to ("when", "why", "where", "what", or "how").
3. Briefly justify the choice of the aspect and the type of segmentation.
4. Describe how the task can be segmented or divided along this aspect.  
5. Provide brief "guidelines" that explain how to identify segment boundaries or assign labels based on the transcript of a tutorial. 
6. Provide a few examples of "segment labels".

### ANNOTATION GUIDELINES
- Use only the transcript text to infer the distinction.
- Keep aspect titles short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).
- Keep example segment labels short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).

MESSAGES: ROLE: system
You are a helpful assistant who can reliably and precisely describe task contexts where pieces of information apply.
ROLE: user

You are given information pieces from tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat. Identify a set of aspects of a task context (a particular temporal segmentation) that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces.

### INPUTS
Information 1: The present newspaper is the Conex East Garland news.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```hate you today i teach you how to make a paper hat out of a newspaper so here we go there's five steps to do here we go step one you get your shiny newspaper as so my newspaper is conex East garland news how interesting you get a newspaper and you fold in her which is pretty easy because newspapers for like that enemies then the next step is folding the piece```
Information 2: Encore Mega on a size 15 needle yields about two stitches per inch.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```people make hats this way it does involve some seaming and I'll show you that but what I'm using here is really big needles and really thick yarn this is called encore mega and on a size 15 needle it gives you two stitches per inch and that's just something I'm using right now and I'll tell you why it makes a quick it's a very quick knit just quick quick turn it up and it it's very thick and you only generally need one skein to do this you can use two it```
Information 3: State that the kits come with all materials needed to make an Easter bonnet and include the bonnet and a list of step-by-step instructions.
Surrounding context (tutorial excerpt): ```bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you there were three kits available there's a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and there's a lamb kit and come with all materials that you'll need to make an Easter bonnet as well as the bonnet and a list of instructions to help you go through it step by step but if you have any questions or any ideas that you want to discuss please get in touch thank you for watching```


### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
1. Identify at least one aspect of a task context that would assign DIFFERENT segment labels to the pieces. You can list multiple aspects if you can, but make sure they are orthogonal (i.e., do not overlap with respect to type).
2. Classify which type of aspect it belongs to ("when", "why", "where", "what", or "how").
3. Briefly justify the choice of the aspect and the type of segmentation.
4. Describe how the task can be segmented or divided along this aspect.  
5. Provide brief "guidelines" that explain how to identify segment boundaries or assign labels based on the transcript of a tutorial. 
6. Provide a few examples of "segment labels".

### ANNOTATION GUIDELINES
- Use only the transcript text to infer the distinction.
- Keep aspect titles short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).
- Keep example segment labels short, but easily interpretable (max. 2-3 words).

MESSAGES: ROLE: system
You are a helpful assistant who can reliably and precisely describe task contexts where pieces of information apply.
ROLE: user

You are analyzing aspects of a task context (a particular temporal segmentation) for `How to Make a Paper Hat`/

### INPUTS
- Aspects of a task context, each labeled with an ID in square brackets (e.g., "[F1] ..."): [F1] (when) Stage (Plural: Stages) -- Divide the tutorial into ordered temporal steps from setup/preparation, through execution of construction actions, to finishing/aftercare steps. Each transcript piece is labeled by which step in the overall process it belongs to (e.g., Preparation, Construction, Finishing).
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- Label a segment as Preparation if the speaker talks about future plans, scheduling, gathering materials, or orienting participants (mentions 'tomorrow', 'we're going to', or class/participants).
- Label as Construction when the speaker describes concrete making actions (cutting, folding, measuring, punching, threading) and gives measurements or exact manipulation instructions.
- Label as Finishing if the speaker describes final touches, decorating, or completion remarks (painting, coloring, 'we're done', or concluding statements).
- Assign boundaries when the transcript shifts from describing what will happen or is prepared for (Preparation) into step-by-step physical operations (Construction), and finally into decoration/closure (Finishing).
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Planning, scheduling, or arranging participants/materials before making begins.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Construction
Definition: Active building steps: cutting, folding, measuring, assembling the hat.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S3] Finishing
Definition: Final touches or decoration steps and wrap-up comments (painting, coloring, concluding remarks).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F2] (what) Component (Plural: Components) -- Split the transcript based on which object or subcomponent is the focus: overall hat/decoration, specific cut/slit features, or folded flaps/top sheet. Each piece is labeled according to the object it addresses.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- If the text refers to decorating or the finished hat as an item to be painted or shown to a class, label as 'Hat (finished)'.
- If the text gives measurements or instructions about cuts/slits in the paper, label as 'Slit/Cut'.
- If the text instructs folding of sheets, flaps, or assembling layers, label as 'Fold/Flap'.
- Assign boundaries when the mention shifts focus from one physical component to another (e.g., from slits to folding).
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Hat (finished)
Definition: The complete hat or its decoration—the object as final product or what will be painted.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Slit/Cut
Definition: Descriptions or measurements concerning cuts or slits made in the paper.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S3] Fold/Flap
Definition: Instructions about folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F3] (how) Action (Plural: Actions) -- Segments correspond to the procedural action described: Plan/Assign activities, Measure/Estimate operations, and Manipulate/Fold steps. Each transcript piece is associated with the primary action verb and instructional modality.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- Label as Plan/Assign when the speaker schedules an activity, assigns it to others, or states future intent ('we're going to paint', 'tomorrow').
- Label as Measure/Estimate when the speaker provides numerical guidance, lengths, or indicates approximation (mentions inches, centimeters, 'about').
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives step-by-step physical instructions (fold, turn, punch, thread).
- Boundaries occur where the dominant verb category changes from planning to measuring to hands-on manipulation.
```
Example labels: ```
[S1] Plan/Assign
Definition: Scheduling or assigning the activity to participants; non-action-oriented planning statements.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S2] Measure/Estimate
Definition: Providing numerical sizes, approximations, or guidance on how long or big to cut.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[S3] Manipulate
Definition: Direct physical actions to transform the material (folding, turning, punching, threading).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F4] (when) Stage (Plural: Stages) -- Divide the tutorial into temporal stages of the hat-making activity: (1) Preparation/Pre-checks before folding, (2) Construction/Execution of folding steps, and (3) Finishing/Decoration after primary folding is done.
Guidelines for defining labels: ```
- Label a transcript segment as Preparation if it contains advice about what to do before starting (e.g., 'watch this video first', choosing paper size).
- Label as Construction if the transcript gives concrete folding or assembly instructions (e.g., 'fold the paper in half', 'fold over the top half').
- Label as Finishing if the text discusses decorating, personalization, or final touches (e.g., 'use stickers', 'put each name on their hat').
- Boundaries occur when the speaker shifts from preparatory remarks to step-by-step actions, and again when they switch from folding instructions to decorative/finish commentary.
```

### GOAL
Combine the given aspects of a task context to get a set of aspects of a task context that are orthogonal (the segmentation wrt one aspect does not determine the segmentation wrt another aspect), single-slot (the segmentation title and labels are short and easily interpretable), and cover all initial aspects of a task context.

### POSSIBLE TYPES OF ASPECTS:
| Type | Example Titles | Example Labels | Example Distinction |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| When | Stage of process | Setup / Execution | Different steps in time |
| Why | Purpose / Subgoal | Collect Data / Analyze Data | Different goals or intentions |
| Where | Environment | Field / Lab | Different physical or digital settings |
| What | Object of focus | Hardware / Software | Working on different components |
| How | Method / Tool used | Manual / Automated | Using different approaches or tools |

### PROCEDURE
Iterate until stable:
1) Check for orthogonality:
    - Redefine or replace non-orthogonal pairs with independent aspects of a task context.  
    - Example (WRONG: not independent):  
        - [F3] Physical settings
        - [F4] Settings
        - Settings are more general than physical settings, so can focus on one of the two.
    - Example (CORRECT: independent redesign):  
        - [F4] Settings
2) Check for single-slot:
    - Rephrase aspects of a task context so that segmentation title and labels fit in max. 3 words, but are easily interpretable.
    - Example (WRONG: too long):  
        - [F5] Task phase segmentation
    - Example (CORRECT: single-slot):  
        - [F5] Phases
4) Check for coverage:
    - Ensure the new set preserves all the meaning of the original aspects of a task context.

### EXIT CONDITION
The final aspect set is smallest (i.e., has the fewest number of aspects), orthogonal, single-slot, and fully covers the initial aspects.

[15 - 15] hate you today i teach you how to make a
[15 - 18] paper hat out of a newspaper so here we
[18 - 21] go there's five steps to do here we go
[21 - 24] step one you get your shiny newspaper as
[24 - 29] so my newspaper is conex East garland
[29 - 32] news how interesting you get a newspaper
[32 - 36] and you fold in her which is pretty easy
[36 - 38] because newspapers for like that enemies
[38 - 41] then the next step is folding the piece
[41 - 44] of paper in half again so it turns out
[44 - 52] like so this is really hard at one hand
[52 - 55] like so then you unfold it again so you
[55 - 57] have a nice line in the middle you fold
[57 - 61] in the corners to that middle line like
[61 - 67] that and like that so it should come
[67 - 71] down like so step 4 should be left at
[71 - 73] these two little flaps at the bottom you
[73 - 76] fold the flaps up over the two triangles
[76 - 84] like that down the other side
[90 - 90] and there you have your paper hat so now
[90 - 92] i'm going to get my sister change to
[92 - 94] mark the hat for you and now this piece
[94 - 98] of crud turns into a divine hash for all
[98 - 103] parties give us a spin on his vine to
[103 - 105] vine and now probably small headed
[105 - 107] people we have the manager version of
[107 - 111] the paper hat give us a spin or which is
[111 - 114] simply divine so now the next time you
[114 - 116] go to buy a hash don't bother I make
[116 - 121] your own ladies    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hi guys welcome back to origami twist my
[2 - 6] name is Jenna and today's video is one
[6 - 10] that is meant for all of those people
[10 - 13] who have been dealing with snow days and
[13 - 16] born children as a result of the snow
[16 - 19] days now as you probably know I live in
[19 - 21] Australia but I am from the northeastern
[21 - 24] part of the United States and boy oh boy
[24 - 26] have you guys had some weather recently
[26 - 30] whoa Facebook was literally blowing up
[30 - 32] with oh no not another snow day we're
[32 - 34] gonna be going to school in July at this
[34 - 37] rate right oh it's horrible but if
[37 - 40] you've got young children and they're
[40 - 42] stuck inside all day hopefully you got
[42 - 45] up to play in the snow but this
[45 - 47] particular project is great for
[47 - 51] imagination and playing dress-up and
[51 - 53] coming up with stories and ideas and
[53 - 56] basically kicking the kids out of
[56 - 58] boredom and you don't have to be in a
[58 - 62] snow snowy area of the world in order to
[62 - 65] do it it is the classic newspaper paper
[66 - 69] hat so yes you probably already have all
[69 - 70] the materials necessary to make this
[70 - 74] project and say all you need again one
[74 - 77] sheet of newspaper and let's get started
[77 - 82] so I have a what appears to be like a
[82 - 86] half size newspaper and if you've got
[86 - 87] one of those big ones just fold it in
[87 - 88] half and then fold it in half again
[88 - 91] until you have this rectangle about this
[91 - 94] size then the rest of it is really
[94 - 96] really easy you're just gonna fold one
[96 - 100] corner in to make a right triangle there
[101 - 104] you go and you're folding at the middle
[104 - 106] and then you're going to fold the other
[106 - 109] corner in to make another right triangle
[109 - 113] again folding down in the middle so
[113 - 114] you'll have a long skinny strip down
[114 - 118] here and two triangles up top you're
[118 - 120] going to fold this flap up it onto
[120 - 121] itself
[121 - 124] okay let's see how I folded it up onto
[124 - 126] itself to meet the bottom of those
[126 - 130] triangles and then you just fold it up
[130 - 134] again okay now you're going to turn it
[134 - 136] around and do the same thing you're
[136 - 139] gonna fold that bottom flap up so that
[139 - 142] it meets roughly at this point at the
[142 - 145] bottom of the triangle and you should be
[145 - 148] able to tell where that bottom is just
[148 - 150] by looking at the other side so just
[150 - 152] guess it's very rough it doesn't have to
[152 - 154] be perfect and then you're gonna fold
[154 - 158] that rectangle up again so that it
[158 - 161] matches the other side now all that you
[161 - 165] need to do at this stage is open it up
[165 - 169] and as you can see it creates what
[169 - 171] appears to be like a captain's hat
[171 - 173] now I'm sorry I haven't been looking at
[173 - 174] you this whole time I'm trying to see
[174 - 176] myself in the screen I'm not used to
[176 - 177] doing tutorials this way so thank you
[177 - 180] for bearing with me and without further
[180 - 186] ado that's it okay
[186 - 188] now I've got another couple of videos
[188 - 191] that work great with this it's called
[191 - 194] the captain's shirt story it uses this
[194 - 196] as a base and then it turns into a
[196 - 198] really neat interesting story so if
[198 - 200] you're interested in going a bit further
[200 - 202] with this fold let me know in the
[202 - 204] comments below and I'll make videos for
[204 - 208] that so in the comments below yes please
[208 - 211] on the captain's shirt story or whatever
[211 - 213] you know you'd like to put down there
[213 - 215] and thank you so much for watching
[215 - 218] please subscribe if you enjoy paper
[218 - 221] crafting and that sort of thing and I
[221 - 234] hope you guys have a fabulous day bye    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Stages (i.e., Divide the transcript into ordered temporal steps of the hat-making process. Assign each transcript piece to the stage it primarily describes: Preparation (planning, gathering materials, orientation), Construction (step-by-step physical building and folding), or Finishing (final touches, decoration, drying, closing remarks).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Planning, gathering materials, sizing and orienting participants before making begins.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: all you need again one sheet of newspaper
	- Context 1: 66 - 74 it is the classic newspaper paper hat so yes you probably already have all the materials necessary to make this project and say all you need again one sheet of newspaper and let's get started
	- Content 2: if you've got one of those big ones just fold it in half
	- Context 2: 82 - 88 so I have a what appears to be like a half size newspaper and if you've got one of those big ones just fold it in half and then fold it in half again
```
[S2] Construction
Definition: Active building steps: folding, creasing, flipping, cutting, measuring, punching, and assembling the hat.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: you're just gonna fold one corner in to make a right triangle
	- Context 1: 94 - 100 then the rest of it is really really easy you're just gonna fold one corner in to make a right triangle there
	- Content 2: now all that you need to do at this stage is open it up
	- Context 2: 158 - 165 so that it matches the other side now all that you need to do at this stage is open it up
```
[S3] Finishing
Definition: Final touches, decoration, drying, trimming, presentation, or closing remarks and wrap-up.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: that's it okay
	- Context 1: 177 - 186 thank you for bearing with me and without further ado that's it okay
	- Content 2: please subscribe if you enjoy paper crafting
	- Context 2: 213 - 221 and thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you enjoy paper crafting and that sort of thing and I hope you guys have a fabulous day bye

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hi my name is Leanne I'm the creator
[2 - 4] keeping my toddler entertain which aims
[4 - 6] to provide daily inspiration for keeping
[6 - 7] your toddler entertained using
[7 - 10] inexpensive materials and recycled
[10 - 12] objects from around your home today i
[12 - 13] kept my daughter entertained with a
[13 - 16] piece of newspaper and a toilet roll so
[16 - 20] today we're going to make a paper hat so
[20 - 21] first what we do we need a piece of
[21 - 24] paper you want the open ends towards you
[24 - 28] fold it in half and we're going to do
[28 - 32] some triangle folds sit up quite to the
[33 - 37] center and try and keep it nice and even
[41 - 41] on both sides and then what we're going
[41 - 44] to do with this bottom flap fold it up
[44 - 54] halfway let me going to fold it up again
[60 - 60] make sure it's all muscle then we're
[60 - 62] going to turn it over and repeat the
[62 - 71] process on the other side and there you
[71 - 75] have it a pirate    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 7] hi I'm Jenny Jones and I'm an arts and
[7 - 9] crafts expert I'm here today to show you
[9 - 13] how to make a paper hats
[16 - 16] you can use any paper to make your paper
[16 - 18] hat but I would recommend that you use a
[18 - 21] nice big piece of newspaper or a3 paper
[21 - 24] if you want your hat to fit your head
[24 - 26] you're going to need one full sheet of
[26 - 29] newspaper what you need to do to start
[29 - 31] with is take the top of the paper and
[31 - 35] fold it down make a crease and then I
[35 - 37] want you to take your ruler and you need
[37 - 45] to measure half way draw a line
[47 - 47] place your ruler and your pencil to the
[47 - 50] side and then you're going to take the
[50 - 52] top left-hand corner of the newspaper
[52 - 57] and fold it down to that middle center
[57 - 60] line and make a crease now do the same
[60 - 64] for the other side to the middle and
[64 - 69] make a crease okay and then I want you
[69 - 74] to take the top piece of paper and fold
[74 - 83] it up again make a crease across and you
[83 - 89] need to turn the newspaper over now
[89 - 91] depending how much you fold these size
[91 - 93] bits in or determine whether it'll fit
[93 - 96] your head or not so if it's for myself I
[96 - 102] would fold it in about this much and do
[102 - 107] the same for the other side and then
[107 - 109] lastly you need to fold the other side
[109 - 118] of the paper up to match make a crease
[124 - 124] and there you have it you'll paper hat
[124 - 127] this hat would be absolutely perfect for

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Stages (i.e., Divide the transcript into ordered temporal steps of the hat-making process. Assign each transcript piece to the stage it primarily describes: Preparation (planning, gathering materials, orientation), Construction (step-by-step physical building and folding), or Finishing (final touches, decoration, drying, closing remarks).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Planning, gathering materials, sizing and orienting participants before making begins.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: you can use any paper
	- Context 1: 16 - 18 you can use any paper to make your paper hat but I would
	- Content 2: if you want your hat to fit your head
	- Context 2: 21 - 24 if you want your hat to fit your head
```
[S2] Construction
Definition: Active building steps: folding, creasing, flipping, cutting, measuring, punching, and assembling the hat.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fold it down
	- Context 1: 29 - 35 with is take the top of the paper and fold it down make a crease and then
	- Content 2: fold it down to that middle center line
	- Context 2: 50 - 57 and then you're going to take the top left-hand corner of the newspaper and fold it down to that middle center line and make
```
[S3] Finishing
Definition: Final touches, decoration, drying, trimming, presentation, or closing remarks and wrap-up.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: and there you have it you'll paper hat
	- Context 1: 124 - 124 and there you have it you'll paper hat
	- Content 2: that's how to make a paper hat
	- Context 2: 137 - 139 and that's how to make a paper hat you

[18 - 18] okay hi guys today we're going to make a
[18 - 22] Mother's Day hat for you and it's for
[22 - 24] Mother's Day coming up on Sunday we're
[24 - 26] gonna have a little Mother's Day Tea
[26 - 28] Party for Jillian's preschool tomorrow
[28 - 31] so we're doing this in preparation for
[31 - 34] that for all the moms in her preschool
[34 - 37] see so it looks really cute on this is
[37 - 40] the finished product and all the moms
[40 - 42] I'm happy to wear it tomorrow so here we
[42 - 44] go so the things that you're going to
[44 - 48] need is one large piece of butcher paper
[48 - 51] or newsprint will work too and then
[51 - 54] you're going to need two sized bowls one
[54 - 58] larger than the other and so two bowls
[58 - 63] scissors stapler really just stapler and
[63 - 68] some tape okay so let's get started so
[68 - 70] first you start off by forming the Hat
[70 - 72] so you need a mold and that's what the
[72 - 74] bowls are going to do I'm going to put
[74 - 76] the bowl underneath the smaller bowl
[76 - 80] goes underneath the paper okay right in
[80 - 82] the center and then Julian can you help
[82 - 86] switch down the paper a little bit okay
[86 - 89] there you go so then you're going to
[89 - 93] place the larger bowl on top
[97 - 97] put your hand up go ahead and push down
[97 - 103] the bolt and that's the uniform that the
[103 - 106] top with the Hat and you kind of just
[106 - 107] spread off the paper
[107 - 110] give me a lot of folding and cutting
[110 - 115] involved with this and stately okay this
[115 - 118] is just getting the shape of the Hat
[118 - 120] once that's down secure then you can
[120 - 127] lift it up there's the top of the half a
[134 - 134] little Bowl still there okay let's put
[134 - 136] it back we don't want to lose our shape
[136 - 138] here so the next thing I'm going to do
[138 - 140] is to secure the shape we're going to
[140 - 142] use some masking tape okay
[142 - 144] so Jillian why don't you hold down this
[144 - 150] paper you hold the top and we're going
[150 - 153] to start just circling around the Hat
[153 - 160] with the tape kind of press it down as
[160 - 168] you go
[173 - 173] good job Jill and then we're gonna have
[173 - 181] to measure it to see if it fits
[185 - 185] okay it's a little bit big so you can
[185 - 190] take it in by folding it a little bit so
[190 - 191] if it's a little big you can just kind
[191 - 196] of fold it over a little bit what we're
[196 - 200] going to do the rim in a second okay and
[200 - 203] then just use some more tape I like to
[203 - 206] put a second row tape on just to make it
[206 - 215] really secure since the paper is very
[215 - 219] large I'm going to trim the edges so we
[219 - 222] have less paper to work with I'm just
[222 - 224] going to go around and trim it kind of
[224 - 230] in a circle okay so now this is the fun
[230 - 233] part with the kids you'll get to make
[233 - 236] the brim of the Hat just like this so it
[236 - 238] has a little brim all around the sides
[238 - 241] make it finished and look nice so what
[241 - 242] they're going to do is just fold around
[242 - 246] and go all the way around okay go ahead
[246 - 246] Jo
[246 - 254] keep folding it up go and turning it and
[254 - 257] kind of go along after them and press it
[257 - 265] down press it down right there you go
[269 - 269] and then I'm going to go around behind
[269 - 272] her and staple it to secure it and it
[272 - 283] doesn't have to be even lots of muscles
[283 - 287] then there's your undecorated hat ready
[287 - 296] to go let's see okay so we're done with
[296 - 299] the hats the only thing left to do is to
[299 - 301] paint them and make them colorful so
[301 - 302] tomorrow we're going to paint them with
[302 - 305] their preschool class and it should be a
[305 - 308] lot of fun right okay so see you
[308 - 344] tomorrow    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[7 - 7] Winston you want to show everyone how to
[7 - 11] make a nurse hat no you want to play
[11 - 14] with the container camera okay so today
[14 - 15] I'm going to show you how to make a
[15 - 17] really cute little nurse hat I made
[17 - 19] these for my friend's bachelorette party
[19 - 22] and it was super fun and super easy so
[22 - 24] you start off with for you
[24 - 30] square square my square is I don't know
[30 - 33] I just kind of estimated 21 and a half
[33 - 38] centimeters or eight inches or something
[38 - 39] like that
[39 - 41] eight and a half inches it's a square so
[41 - 44] both sides are the same length okay then
[44 - 47] the top of my square I cut two slits
[47 - 50] again I just kind of estimating it's not
[50 - 53] being a very good in the crafter so it's
[53 - 58] like three inches about or seven
[58 - 61] centimeters obviously it's not super
[61 - 62] duper important how big it is because I
[62 - 64] just asked me to indicate myself anyways
[64 - 66] okay so you have your three slits cut
[66 - 69] with scissors you're going to take these
[69 - 72] two you're going to fold them so that
[72 - 79] they match see the edges match nicely
[79 - 85] and I just use tape this is I just made
[85 - 87] it not too hard because I had to make
[87 - 91] like 15 of them or something so that was
[91 - 96] that once it steeps kind of flaxen edge
[96 - 98] hold the edges now I have a shape like
[98 - 102] this lovely pink then you take the top
[102 - 106] part and fold it over the other two
[106 - 110] parts Erin you take your tape and you do
[110 - 114] the same thing tape fix hold on your
[114 - 118] tape a bit now you have a sheet like
[118 - 122] this
[125 - 125] very good I stuff a little flat cross on
[125 - 128] the top then you're going to look at it
[128 - 131] and you have this big thing so I pulled
[131 - 137] it and folded it again so now I know
[137 - 139] exactly how my nurse hat is going to
[139 - 142] look fake it so just so it has those
[142 - 145] things there then I just kind of need
[145 - 150] little folds on the sides of it when you
[150 - 154] put it on your head it's going to sit
[154 - 156] like a little cap so just trying to bend
[156 - 158] the edges a little bit so see how it
[158 - 161] makes kind of a little pact once you
[161 - 163] have your little edges in then you can
[163 - 170] go ahead and fold your thing back up a
[170 - 176] little bit nurse hat so cute these fit
[177 - 178] on our heads really really well and all
[178 - 180] we did was just stick some bobby pins in
[180 - 181] the back
[181 - 183] JooJoo and they stayed in our head
[183 - 185] really really well if you want to go a
[185 - 187] little bit further you can take some of
[187 - 190] this stuff hmm I chose black before a
[190 - 196] bride we had white and I'm super lazy
[196 - 198] and don't have a lot of crafting
[198 - 203] materials I just used regular tape put
[203 - 207] it on my sail material and dock it in
[207 - 211] the back so it would come out of the
[211 - 213] back of our thing and I put a few layers
[213 - 216] that are always anyway so that's how we
[216 - 217] run around the what the bride had a
[217 - 220] black hat and had a white veil and it
[220 - 222] was super funny and cute and easy and
[222 - 224] everyone loves them
[224 - 227] isn't that right Winston everyone loved
[227 - 235] them even rinsed
[239 - 239] there you go do you like that book no
[239 - 246] Zack Winston yeah didn't you    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[23 - 25] wake up use your newspaper for now i
[25 - 28] would first thing you need to do is to
[28 - 33] make sure that it's amble flat on the
[33 - 37] edges especially even and definitely on
[37 - 39] this side you don't it all like bumpy
[39 - 44] and you do the heart so that's how flat
[44 - 46] it should be and then you want to fold
[46 - 49] it in half again so we fold it like this
[49 - 52] you need to fold it so it's perfectly
[52 - 56] not off the edge so I need to do it like
[56 - 59] that now we have to make sure it's
[59 - 64] flutters down like that playgirl press
[64 - 67] and all the rest out and that's the
[67 - 69] second part and now we need to fold it
[69 - 73] back out to get that was just to give us
[73 - 75] 10 tonight page so now we need to fold
[75 - 78] this part of the paper we just go like
[78 - 80] this we need to make sure it's right on
[80 - 83] the middle right on target that make
[83 - 87] sure top right just like that I mean
[87 - 91] lots of the flowers much as we can there
[91 - 94] we go so you have to do it to the crease
[94 - 96] in the middle that's what the creased is
[96 - 98] fought and now we have to do it to this
[98 - 101] side now straight to the middle make
[101 - 104] sure it's connected to my name is it

[115 - 121] you just phone it to where that is there
[121 - 125] then you have to flatten it down make
[125 - 127] sure the triangles stay down so now we
[127 - 131] have to fold this part or so you get the
[131 - 133] side of the half to make sure perfectly
[133 - 138] flat now we do the opposite side exactly
[138 - 142] the same that's why we have the need the
[142 - 146] this side so we go to the other side and

[3 - 3] today we're going to make hats oh did
[3 - 5] you see I took off my hat
[5 - 6] that's right take off your hat it'll
[6 - 8] take my dog we're gonna make hats out of
[8 - 12] newspaper and for this all you need is
[12 - 14] newspaper so I'll take one of these one
[14 - 16] sheet while you're there so what do we
[16 - 19] read in today no no no we're just not
[19 - 21] reading we're making hats we're making
[21 - 24] hat so all right so normally a newspaper
[24 - 26] is already folded so we can already
[26 - 27] leave that folded right there
[27 - 29] great just like this and we're going to
[29 - 31] take that and we're going to you know
[31 - 33] they say what did they say when when
[33 - 35] you're folding it there's hot dog and
[35 - 37] hamburger is that right so that's ham
[37 - 40] hamburger is a cross you know so you
[40 - 42] have a wider one and then hotdog would
[42 - 44] be the thinner one right yep
[44 - 46] so what we want to do is we want to give
[46 - 49] one fold in half hamburger style number
[49 - 52] seven all right so then we're making a
[52 - 55] crease right down the middle of it it
[55 - 56] doesn't even it doesn't have to be
[56 - 58] perfect that pair of nothing has to be
[58 - 61] right so now we have a nice crease right
[61 - 63] there right in the middle and now we're
[63 - 66] going to make we're going to fold the
[66 - 68] corners the top two corners where the
[68 - 71] fold is you see that there's already
[71 - 72] pulled down we're going to fold those
[72 - 75] corners in at the half
[75 - 78] like right along that crease so there's
[78 - 81] one side you see and then here's the
[81 - 83] other side and we'll both do them on the
[83 - 89] same same side here so now what you have
[89 - 93] should look like this that's what you
[93 - 95] should be seeing and this should be kind
[95 - 97] of open on the bottom right did you have
[97 - 99] a couple scoops oh how you doing there
[99 - 101] Brian I think I'm doing pretty well
[101 - 105] all right good so now the next step is
[105 - 107] that we're going to see yeah the bottom
[107 - 109] edge around here right here and you see
[109 - 111] how you have two sheets it looks like
[111 - 113] you have two sheets of paper there
[113 - 115] together for we're going to fold the
[115 - 118] first sheet of paper up so just one yeah
[118 - 120] and it's kind of like I guess hot dog
[120 - 123] style you're gonna pull it right all the
[123 - 125] way up make it so it looks like this
[125 - 128] right yeah that's right it's a nice
[128 - 130] thick creaser so then so this is what
[130 - 132] that side should look like is that you
[132 - 134] folded right along this
[134 - 138] were those two triangles where those two
[138 - 140] corners came in and you fold it right up
[140 - 143] along here okay so now you're gonna flip
[143 - 147] it over so you see just the back back
[147 - 150] and now this is where we're gonna size
[150 - 152] it now I have a really big head so I'm
[152 - 155] only gonna do small yeah so I'm gonna
[155 - 158] make I'll make a smaller hat for the
[158 - 159] people on the internet because they
[159 - 160] probably don't have as big a head as I
[160 - 162] do and then you're trying to make a big
[162 - 164] hat so they could fit around your food
[164 - 166] around my head so what what we do here
[166 - 170] is we take these sides the whole side
[170 - 172] right here and we fold it in so here's
[172 - 174] one side we're gonna fold this in you
[174 - 177] know we're Emison as much as our much so
[177 - 180] if you have like a smaller head you can
[180 - 183] fold it in like you know a couple three
[183 - 186] inches right there but if you have a
[186 - 188] bigger head like me you can fold it in
[188 - 191] fold it in just a little bit like that
[191 - 193] now do the same on the other side fold
[193 - 198] it up and in like that make a nice
[198 - 200] little crease so now if you're holding
[200 - 202] them because they're gonna try to flap
[202 - 203] out they look like this so this is what
[203 - 207] your back should look like and then just
[207 - 209] like on the front side you're going to
[209 - 212] fold this right up fold this bottom edge
[212 - 215] right up so now it's all and not on the
[215 - 217] same size but on the opposite so on the
[217 - 219] opposite side so now you'll still have
[219 - 221] that little space right in the middle
[221 - 224] and that's a base that your head goes no
[224 - 228] if you start popping it out a little bit
[228 - 230] you're the Apple about it it fits my
[230 - 232] head does it fit your head I got it
[232 - 236] perfect size the one size fits all it's
[236 - 238] supposed to go to the front leg well you
[238 - 239] can do that whichever way you want it to
[239 - 243] be turned that looks really good musics
[243 - 246] great awesome well that's how we make a
[246 - 247] paper right now there are other things
[247 - 250] we can do with this what can we do we
[250 - 252] can put little things in this little in
[252 - 253] the little room in your little brim you
[253 - 255] can have things hanging out and you will
[255 - 260] decorate your hats in fact I'm going to
[260 - 263] add something you have okay I'm gonna
[263 - 266] make it funnier funny hats no no you're
[266 - 271] yo little a nice little I my third
[271 - 273] googly eye there and their way here I
[273 - 275] have another one okay we need to get as
[275 - 277] many eyes as we can right and then
[277 - 280] another googly eye there right now your
[280 - 291] hat has eyes awesome
[302 - 302] alright by the way that is our crafty
[302 - 310] mid cross craft craft    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 7] hi my name is Laura I'm an artist and
[7 - 8] I'm going to show you how to make a
[8 - 11] three sided paper hat what you're going
[11 - 14] to need is a sheet of paper I have an
[14 - 16] eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper
[16 - 19] it's going to make a small hat so if you
[19 - 21] want to make a larger hat use a larger
[21 - 22] sheet of paper
[22 - 25] so first the first step is you're gonna
[25 - 29] fold the paper in half lengthwise like
[29 - 33] this after you fold it use your
[33 - 38] fingernail to to make that fold sharper
[38 - 42] and then what you're going to do is make
[42 - 44] sure that the folded side is away from
[44 - 49] you the open edges toward you fold the
[49 - 52] upper right and left hand corners in
[52 - 53] toward each other so that they meet in
[53 - 56] the middle and then do a sort of
[56 - 60] temporary temporary fold and then again
[60 - 62] sharpen that with your fingernail on
[62 - 68] both sides and you'll have flaps left
[68 - 70] facing towards you what you're going to
[70 - 76] do is fold one side up on one side
[76 - 79] fingernail it down and then flip it over
[79 - 83] and take that other flap up on the other
[83 - 90] side and then you have one two three
[90 - 95] corners on your hat and you can put it
[95 - 99] on your head like that I am Laura thank
[99 - 101] you for watching how to make a three
[101 - 105] sided paper hat

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hey everybody this is gonna be a
[2 - 5] tutorial on how to make a paper hat so
[5 - 7] the first step is you want to draw three
[7 - 10] shapes that look like this now the first
[10 - 13] shape you draw is gonna have a curve
[13 - 16] right there and then the second one is
[16 - 19] gonna be a little bit less curved but a
[19 - 21] slant going up there but a small slit
[21 - 23] and then the third is going to be the
[23 - 25] smallest piece and the less curved on
[25 - 27] the edge once you have this drawing out
[27 - 28] what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut
[28 - 31] each one out after you cut them out
[31 - 32] you're gonna have three of these and
[32 - 35] you're gonna take one of them put them
[35 - 37] on a white piece of paper and trace
[37 - 39] around because what you're doing is
[39 - 41] you're you're making two of each shape
[41 - 43] and so you're making sure that each one
[43 - 45] is the same size as the one before
[45 - 47] because if it's not the hats not gonna
[47 - 54] fit together correctly and once you have
[54 - 56] all those traced what you're gonna do is
[56 - 58] take some scissors and you're gonna cut
[58 - 63] each one out this is the time to color
[63 - 66] them and if you want to once you have
[66 - 67] them all cut out what you're gonna do is
[67 - 69] you're gonna take one of them and you're
[69 - 71] gonna draw lines like this around the
[71 - 73] edge these represent the seams of the
[73 - 76] Hat and if you want to you can also do a
[76 - 79] dotted line for these instead but you
[79 - 82] can do it however you want and you're
[82 - 88] gonna do that for every single one
[90 - 90] make sure that for these pieces the two
[90 - 92] largest ones the slant is going down on
[92 - 94] that side and going up on that one it's
[94 - 98] almost like a mirror image once you have
[98 - 100] them all drawn on what you're gonna do
[100 - 103] is you're gonna take these to make sure
[103 - 105] it's those two take a piece of tape tape
[105 - 107] on the back and then you're gonna put
[107 - 109] together you are now starting to put the
[109 - 115] Hat together take another piece of tape
[115 - 117] and put it on the back and put them
[117 - 119] together you're gonna be doing this for
[119 - 122] each one just make sure that you don't
[122 - 124] tape too close to the top because when
[124 - 126] you're done sometimes it doesn't fit
[126 - 129] together quite right so you want to make
[129 - 130] sure you have enough room if you need to
[130 - 133] adjust now the next two pieces is you
[133 - 136] want to put ones of the smallest ones on
[136 - 138] one side and the other smallest piece on
[138 - 141] the other side each side has to be
[141 - 142] symmetrical because if you don't put
[142 - 144] them in to get together in the right
[144 - 145] order the hats not going to come out
[145 - 147] right so you have to make sure you're
[147 - 151] doing it in this order and then take
[151 - 154] that other small piece and attach it to
[154 - 173] the other side like that
[175 - 175] now for the two largest pieces which are
[175 - 176] the two lost you have to be careful
[176 - 179] about this make sure that the slants on
[179 - 181] this are going kind of in the mirror
[181 - 184] image again going opposite but then
[184 - 185] after that you just do what you've been
[185 - 187] doing the whole time taping on the back
[187 - 191] and then putting together like this just
[191 - 193] like that just make sure that the slants
[193 - 201] are going the opposite direction
[204 - 204] these two last pieces are usually the
[204 - 206] most difficult to put together because
[206 - 207] everything is a little bit crowded
[207 - 210] because it's making the circular shape
[210 - 214] so it may be a little bit difficult in
[214 - 216] the video you can tell that I'm gonna
[216 - 219] have a little bit of trouble with it but
[219 - 221] it seemed pretty easy to work around but
[221 - 225] just keep taping to the back and then
[225 - 231] putting it together like that and if you
[231 - 233] have a gap at the top that's completely
[233 - 235] fine or if you have a little bit of tape
[235 - 241] left over there don't worry about it and
[241 - 243] if you do have any extra tape up there
[243 - 245] what you can do is just take some
[245 - 247] scissors and cut off the extra tape and
[247 - 248] don't worry about that gap at the top
[248 - 252] because that's gonna be covered up later
[252 - 254] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[254 - 256] take some cardboard make sure it's thin
[256 - 257] cardboard you can use anything you want
[257 - 259] as you can see here I use some Ritz
[259 - 262] cardboard so you can do anything you
[262 - 269] really want make about six tabs like
[269 - 272] that you you actually really only need
[272 - 277] four but um I'm just doing that in case
[277 - 279] I mess out so then take some tape you
[279 - 281] can bend it too it might make it easier
[281 - 283] and then put it in like that and just
[283 - 287] keep taping around the entire hat this
[287 - 288] is to make the Hat more sturdy and it
[288 - 292] also gives the Hat the round shape so
[292 - 294] that if you wear it it won't crumble or
[294 - 297] anything when you put it on and so just
[297 - 299] keep taping around the top and bottom
[299 - 300] make sure they're on there correctly
[300 - 303] make sure they won't fall off and you
[303 - 305] may notice you can see through the white
[305 - 307] hat to the cardboard but that's fine if
[307 - 309] you have your head actually colored in
[309 - 311] right now you um you probably can't even
[311 - 315] see it so it's fine now what you're
[315 - 317] gonna do is you're gonna make the brim
[317 - 319] for that so put the Hat down like that
[319 - 322] and you're gonna make kind of a half
[322 - 328] circle like this yeah and kind of draw
[328 - 331] it in lightly in case you mess up so you
[331 - 333] can erase it and there won't be any left
[333 - 334] over
[334 - 338] marks and once you have it right or how
[338 - 341] you like it just go around and darken it
[341 - 345] back in like that and then put the hat
[346 - 348] back on and you're just gonna make a
[348 - 351] half circle around the edges like this
[351 - 357] and by now which it look like a half
[357 - 361] moon and then just darken it in and then
[361 - 364] once you have it all darken in you're
[364 - 367] gonna cut it out with some scissors and
[367 - 370] this is when you can color the Birman if
[370 - 373] you want to now what we're gonna do is
[373 - 376] you're gonna take some pencil and you're
[376 - 378] gonna draw some lines like this these
[378 - 383] represent the seams of the brim so just
[383 - 389] draw it around like that you can also do
[389 - 392] these dotted lines here instead if you
[392 - 395] want but you can do it any way and just
[395 - 398] keep doing that but before you get to
[398 - 401] the very end about this point stop and
[401 - 406] just leave that area blank in there now
[406 - 407] you're gonna take some cardboard and
[407 - 412] you're gonna trace around the paper it's
[412 - 414] okay if the cardboard is a little bit
[414 - 417] too small as you can see here I have him
[417 - 418] used a little bit too small a piece but
[418 - 420] it's fine just make sure it's not too
[420 - 422] small and then you're gonna cut it out
[422 - 425] because this is gonna make the brim more
[425 - 428] stiff
[430 - 430] and then you're gonna take some glue
[430 - 433] glue the cardboard and then you're just
[433 - 437] gonna put the brim the paper broom onto
[437 - 443] the cardboard
[446 - 446] once you're done with that you can flip
[446 - 449] it over and if you have any writing like
[449 - 453] here and writing like that what you do
[453 - 457] is you trace around and then you cut
[457 - 459] that out and then you're just gonna put
[459 - 460] it over the words or whatever there is
[460 - 462] there so you don't see it and then put
[462 - 464] it down like that and if you can still
[464 - 466] see through you just do it again
[466 - 469] and then you won't be able to see it now
[469 - 470] what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[470 - 473] make sure that shape is the same shape
[473 - 475] you see on the Hat it has to be that
[475 - 478] shape because that's the front tape the
[478 - 487] brim put a few pieces on and tape it to
[487 - 490] the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on
[490 - 499] straight
[502 - 502] now you're gonna fill that gap in so
[502 - 505] take some paper cut out a square
[505 - 511] rectangular shape and you're gonna glue
[511 - 520] the inside of the Hat like this
[523 - 523] and then Pat that down inside and then
[523 - 533] you can't see through anymore like that
[536 - 536] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[536 - 538] make the airholes for that so take some
[538 - 541] paper and draw six circles and put dark
[541 - 545] dots in the middle of each one and then
[545 - 552] cut them out
[554 - 554] once you have them all cut out take some
[554 - 557] glue glue the bottom of them and paste
[557 - 574] them on in these areas on the Hat
[577 - 577] now we're gonna make the very top of the
[577 - 581] Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a
[581 - 584] strip about this big I actually think I
[584 - 587] made it a little bit too long take some
[587 - 590] glue glue the end and make a circle
[590 - 593] shape about this size and glue both ends
[593 - 600] together once you have that done take a
[600 - 602] piece of paper cut out a circle about
[602 - 609] this big take the other piece glue the
[609 - 614] bottom put that on top and then once you
[614 - 619] get that on glue the other side you
[619 - 620] might want to use a little bit more glue
[620 - 622] than I did here and then put that on the
[622 - 627] top right there now this is the point
[627 - 630] when you can put logos on here here here
[630 - 633] I used EC and a bunch of them but you
[633 - 635] can do anything you want and also you
[635 - 637] can go online print this sticker off
[637 - 641] glue the back and put it on the brim to
[641 - 644] give it a more realistic look and there
[644 - 647] you go there's your hat if you have any
[647 - 649] questions you can message me and I'll
[649 - 652] answer anything if you want you can also
[652 - 654] put your video of your hat as a video
[654 - 657] response to this I'd love to see it good
[657 - 659] luck    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 10] your Christmas cracker for this you're
[10 - 13] going to use some tissue paper a ruler a
[13 - 17] pencil some glue and some scissors I'm
[17 - 20] using a twenty by thirty inch piece of
[20 - 23] paper and I'm going to fold it into four
[23 - 26] making four hats let's speed this up a

[38 - 41] to measure 24 inches along the paper and
[41 - 45] then cut just over that so now we're
[45 - 47] going to fold it into three and then
[47 - 49] we're going to cut off the top and the
[49 - 52] bottom so that there we have four
[52 - 58] separate hats
[61 - 61] now we're going to cut a triangle in the
[61 - 74] top followed by half a triangle

[2 - 2] hey you volunteered solo shot and today
[2 - 2] I'm going to show you guys how to make
[2 - 8] paper hats
[11 - 11] this is a very simple tutorial but I
[11 - 13] promise it will be very useful because
[13 - 15] it saved me from boredom multiple times
[15 - 17] and you will thank you for it later
[17 - 19] alright so the only material that you
[19 - 21] can need for this tutorial is one piece
[21 - 25] of paper and so first you're going to
[25 - 28] place your paper down with a landscape
[28 - 30] orientation and then you're going to
[30 - 36] fold it in half vertically then you're
[36 - 38] going to take the top corners and fold
[38 - 41] them into the senton and make sure that
[41 - 47] they are touching
[49 - 49] and after that you're going to fold up
[49 - 51] the little bottom part that it holds
[51 - 54] over top of the corners that you just
[54 - 55] fold it in and you're going to do that
[55 - 62] on both sides
[64 - 64] then all you have to do is just open it
[64 - 66] up from the bottom and bam there you
[66 - 71] have it making paper hats are great way
[71 - 72] to pass the time when you're bored and
[72 - 76] they also make very stylish head hope
[76 - 78] you enjoyed the tutorial and thanks for
[78 - 81] watching

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[53 - 57] taped it all up you can look at it and
[57 - 61] see if it's in as close as you want and
[61 - 65] has that bowler hat look to it once you
[65 - 68] have done that you're going to want to
[68 - 71] take tempera paint or any other paint I
[71 - 73] took this tempered paint put it in a big
[73 - 76] paper plate and use the large brush to
[76 - 79] paint the whole hat newspaper is very
[79 - 81] thin paper and it takes a long time to
[81 - 83] dry so you want to make sure your hat is
[83 - 85] completely dry before you start
[85 - 87] decorating it but in the meantime you
[87 - 89] can cut out what you're going to use to
[89 - 94] make your decorations I use simply three
[94 - 96] hearts that I cut out of construction
[96 - 101] paper and I made them the same size so I
[101 - 105] use the first one as a template cut the
[105 - 116] second one and cut the third one
[122 - 122] and for these I covered them with
[122 - 126] Elmer's glue and then I sprinkled green
[126 - 131] glitter on them and let it dry and once
[131 - 135] that was done I put them together three
[135 - 137] hearts with a little dab of glue I'll
[137 - 138] put a little piece of tape that'll give
[138 - 143] you the idea and my shamrock was ready
[143 - 146] to go from my bowlers hat then once my
[146 - 149] hat was dry I started making that other
[149 - 152] decorations for it no there's your
[152 - 154] shamrock to go in the middle of your hat
[154 - 159] I used shamrock confetti and I used
[159 - 163] glitter glue and I just made some
[163 - 165] decorations around the brim of the Hat
[165 - 169] took my Elmer's glue and put on the
[169 - 171] confetti and glued the shamrock to the
[171 - 173] middle with a little piece of confetti
[173 - 175] now you can of course make a bowlers hat
[175 - 178] any color for any occasion but this is
[178 - 183] how I made a st. Patrick's Day bowler
[183 - 187] hat out of newspaper    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats this very
[8 - 10] fun party hat is made out of only three
[10 - 13] pieces of construction paper this is the
[13 - 15] smaller paper the first thing you want
[15 - 21] to do is take the smaller paper and just
[21 - 26] wrap it around your head until it fits
[26 - 32] and tape or staple it nothing to it
[32 - 37] really once you have your hat secured
[37 - 39] might want to take a special pair of
[39 - 42] scissors but the fancy edges and cut
[42 - 44] around the edge so that you have an edge
[44 - 47] that looks like this and you know if you
[47 - 49] don't have the fancy scissors to do this
[49 - 51] kind of an edge you can always just tear
[51 - 54] the paper and that too will give you a
[54 - 57] fancy edge now one thing that you can do
[57 - 60] too before you even cut out your hat
[60 - 63] before you staple it is to leave it open
[63 - 66] and decorate it you might want to write
[66 - 70] happy birthday and crayon or use markers
[70 - 73] or even use glitter and glue once you've
[73 - 75] done that you put your hat together and
[75 - 78] then you want to make this this is the
[78 - 82] fun stuff and it's so easy to make cut
[82 - 84] out a variety of sizes and colors of
[84 - 87] circles and then just start cutting out
[87 - 89] your circle you want to stay fairly
[89 - 92] close to the edge but it does not have
[92 - 95] to be even that's the beauty of it and
[95 - 97] you just keep cutting until you keep
[97 - 101] Spile spiraling around and you have it
[101 - 103] looking like this and then you take the
[103 - 109] center and stretch it as you can see I
[109 - 111] used several pieces of yellow and
[111 - 114] several pieces of purple I started out
[114 - 116] with a large circle with the purple and
[116 - 119] this was a small circle with the yellow
[119 - 122] put them all together staple them at the
[122 - 128] top shook them out and here we go a
[128 - 131] really fun crazy
[131 - 134] happy birthday hat it would work for new
[134 - 136] to

[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats are Dan
[8 - 11] welcome to Pirates Cove mateys we're
[11 - 13] going to make a very simple pirate hat
[13 - 17] out of a newspaper you know went three
[17 - 19] sheets of newspaper you can use two but
[19 - 22] three sheets gives you a more sturdy hat
[22 - 25] that are two-sided all the way no half
[25 - 27] sheets lay it out in front of you
[27 - 31] sideways with your fold at the front and
[31 - 34] you're going to find the middle and then
[34 - 39] fold it down to the middle not quite
[39 - 43] centered up and down again leaving a
[43 - 45] little bit of space at the top so that
[45 - 48] it's even and then you're simply going
[48 - 52] to take the first three sheets one two
[52 - 64] three and fold them up and crease it
[66 - 66] [Applause]
[66 - 70] turn it over fold up the next three
[70 - 75] sheets and then fasten it I put mine on
[75 - 79] my head and then stapled it right at the
[79 - 81] sides of my head so that it would stay
[81 - 85] on my head and fit you can do that with
[85 - 90] your hat too now you have your base for
[90 - 95] your pirate hat and what I did with mine
[95 - 100] was to use black construction paper to
[100 - 102] cover the front of it but you could also
[102 - 104] use black tempera paint and I stuck it
[104 - 107] down in the Hat band and then I made a
[107 - 110] skull and crossbones and glued it on
[110 - 112] you're going to make a skull and
[112 - 115] crossbones basically you want to make
[115 - 124] kind of a light bulb shape and put the
[124 - 127] two circles for the eyes you're going to
[127 - 130] have your teeth come down again kind of
[130 - 135] to a point and have teeth and your nose
[135 - 145] make them black make your bones
[154 - 154] cut them out glue them on and voila you
[154 - 159] have a pirate's hat pretty simple huh

```
- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[21 - 21] decorate your mash a pirate ship using
[21 - 23] acrylic paint you can have lots of fun
[23 - 25] coming up with a really piratey color
[25 - 32] scheme
[36 - 36] the next step is to fold your card in
[36 - 39] half this is going to create the larger
[39 - 42] waves to go around the outside of your
[42 - 45] hat fold it in half and then we're going
[45 - 60] to draw the wave shape along the paper
[63 - 63] this time to make the smaller waves fold
[63 - 66] your paper in half along the long side
[66 - 78] of the paper and then fold it again
[81 - 81] so you'll find this is slightly more
[81 - 83] difficult to cut through because there's
[83 - 87] four layers of card to cut through so
[87 - 88] you may have to be a bit tougher with
[88 - 92] your scissors but it's well worth it
[92 - 94] because the effect is fantastic at the
[94 - 97] end cut the leaves down the center along
[97 - 106] the fold
[108 - 108] if you have a little extra on the bottom
[108 - 110] you could always just sand that off
[110 - 113] using your glue gun run a line of glue
[113 - 119] along the bottom of your boat and then
[119 - 124] securely attaches to the Hat you'll need
[124 - 125] to hold this in place for a few minutes
[125 - 129] just so it sticks securely so it doesn't
[129 - 130] matter if it's completely straight
[130 - 132] because waves are choppy so it just adds
[132 - 135] to the sea effect next we're going to
[135 - 137] attach the waves to the Hat I'm going to
[137 - 139] use a glue gun but you could use a
[139 - 143] stapler Sini's stick lots of glue onto
[143 - 148] your waves and mold it to the shape of
[148 - 153] the Hat holding it firmly you might need
[153 - 156] to cut your waves to size so it fits
[156 - 163] around the Hat it doesn't matter if it
[163 - 165] overlaps a little bit because the other
[165 - 166] waves are going to go around the edge
[166 - 169] next we're going to attach our smaller
[169 - 174] waves around the edge of the Hat we're
[174 - 175] going to use exactly the same processes
[175 - 180] the larger waves gluing just over the
[180 - 185] top to give this layered effect you will
[185 - 187] need an adult's help with the glue gun
[187 - 189] because it does get very hot I'm going
[189 - 195] to add some treasure to my bonnet you
[195 - 196] can put it wherever you fancy so it
[196 - 199] could be around the boat or it could be
[199 - 200] at the bottom of the ocean it's
[200 - 204] completely up to you and firmly place
[204 - 208] the coins onto the Hat
[208 - 210] if you have any overlapping sections in
[210 - 212] your waves you could always put one of
[212 - 217] the coins over the top so when you stuck
[217 - 218] on your coins
[218 - 221] it obviously adds some sparkle to your
[221 - 228] hat we're going to add the bunting so
[228 - 230] you can attach this however you like you
[230 - 231] could use as little or as much as you
[231 - 233] like so I'm going to attach it the top
[233 - 238] just with a little blob of glue and you
[238 - 241] can cut off any excess just adds the
[241 - 260] finishing touches to your pirate ship    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[65 - 67] add some sellotape so that it doesn't
[67 - 71] move then take a mixture of 3/4 part of
[71 - 73] glue and 1/4 part of water and apply a
[73 - 75] layer of newspaper on half of the

[113 - 116] to dry as well
[120 - 120] and when the second layer of newspaper
[120 - 123] dries pop the balloon so that you get
[123 - 127] this dome-like shape now take a chart
[127 - 129] paper and place the dome on it in the
[129 - 133] center and Mark points then take a plate
[133 - 135] and draw a circle connecting these
[135 - 139] points then draw a smaller circle inside
[139 - 142] the circle and then a bigger on the
[142 - 146] outside
[149 - 149] so now we have one small one medium and
[149 - 151] one big circle out of which the medium
[151 - 154] one is exactly the size of the dome now
[154 - 162] cut out the circle
[173 - 173] [Music]
[173 - 177] then from the inside circle cut slits to
[177 - 180] the middle circle
[188 - 188] now fold the paper like so

[198 - 204] as well and fold them outwards
[222 - 222] the apply glue on these little portions
[222 - 225] and then place the chart paper on it and
[225 - 232] stick it well
[234 - 234] [Music]
[234 - 237] then apply glue on these little portions
[237 - 239] of the chart paper and stick it on the
[239 - 243] dome
[250 - 250] [Music]
[250 - 253] once that is done leave it to dry
[253 - 258] overnight so that the dome hardens then
[258 - 260] paint it with your favourite colour I

[262 - 265] make sure to paint the side as well as
[265 - 268] even this will be showing then apply

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] in this clip I'm going to show you how
[2 - 5] to make a paper top hat you're gonna
[5 - 8] take a piece of paper a paper plate here
[8 - 10] you can take your scissors and you're
[10 - 12] going to cut out the middle by carefully
[12 - 15] poking the scissors through the top and
[15 - 19] cutting leaving a little bit of the
[19 - 23] paper plate on the top and notice that I
[23 - 26] turned the paper plate over or upside
[26 - 31] down I quickly cut that out all the way
[31 - 34] around and then I'm going to take just a
[34 - 37] regular piece of construction paper and
[37 - 39] I'm going to fold down the top just a
[39 - 42] little bit to give it some sturdy nuts
[42 - 46] because I want it to really hold
[46 - 48] together well I'm gonna put a glue stick
[48 - 53] on here pull that down and then I'm
[53 - 56] going to also fold up the bottom about a
[56 - 58] half of an inch and this is going to
[58 - 65] allow the paper top-hat to fit inside of
[65 - 66] the paper plate and I'm going to cut
[66 - 69] little slits around here which will help
[69 - 75] mold it into a circle okay the last
[75 - 76] thing I want to do is I want to overlap
[76 - 78] these so I'm going to put a little bit
[78 - 80] of glue here and I'm going to go ahead
[80 - 87] and put these two together like that and
[87 - 91] there take a piece of tape and put this
[91 - 93] right in the middle where I'm
[93 - 96] overlapping it just to support it a
[96 - 98] little bit now I'm going to put this
[98 - 102] right inside of my paper plate and I'm
[102 - 104] going to turn it upside down and I'm
[104 - 108] going to start gluing these tabs onto
[108 - 112] the paper plate just like you see here
[112 - 115] and I'm going to go ahead and show you
[115 - 118] that this last one and I want to support
[118 - 122] it again with a piece of tape and the
[122 - 125] very last thing I'm going to do is I'm
[125 - 128] going to take my magic marker and I'm
[128 - 130] going to go ahead and make that brim
[130 - 135] black and you have a great top hat

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] hi in this video I'm going to show you
[3 - 6] how you can create an imaginative Easter
[6 - 8] bonnet with your child using simple
[8 - 12] paper mache techniques first of all you
[12 - 15] need a balloon if you're making
[15 - 17] something like this out of an egg shape
[17 - 20] or if you want to make an animal or a
[20 - 23] bird you'll need a small balloon for the
[23 - 26] head and a larger balloon for the body
[26 - 33] so first of all you need to inflate the
[33 - 36] large balloon sit it in a saucepan or
[36 - 40] bowl so it sits securely while you're
[40 - 44] applying the strips of newspaper I've
[44 - 48] cut mine into 1 by 5 inch strips but you
[48 - 50] don't have to be approximate that's only
[50 - 52] approximate you don't have to do it
[52 - 55] exactly the other thing you'll need is a
[55 - 58] pot of PVA glue which has some water in
[58 - 60] so it's running and you'll need a
[60 - 63] paintbrush and your meal apron that will
[63 - 65] cover your child because it can get
[65 - 69] messy so what I recommend is that you
[69 - 71] get your child to cover an area of the
[71 - 75] balloon with glue and I'll show you that
[75 - 79] it should just run on the balloon quite
[79 - 82] easily and then when you've covered an
[82 - 86] area the balloon in PVA close then apply
[86 - 89] strips running in the same direction all
[89 - 95] around the balloon then apply another
[95 - 98] another layer of glue put on the strip's
[98 - 101] going in the opposite direction
[101 - 103] overlapping slightly so there are no
[103 - 107] gaps and then your third layer will go
[108 - 110] back to the original direction and then
[110 - 112] I recommend that for the final layer you
[112 - 116] apply some kitchen towel strips or some
[116 - 118] paper to have strips and because this
[119 - 122] provides a really good base for
[122 - 126] painting it helps it make sure that the
[126 - 128] print doesn't show through or it
[128 - 130] provides a good base if you're wanting
[130 - 135] to put squares of tissue paper onto the
[135 - 139] balloon so after about 24 hours in a
[139 - 142] really warm place your balloon will
[142 - 146] hopefully dry so that it's it's it's
[146 - 154] very solid pop the balloon and cut up a
[154 - 157] circular hole in the bottom large enough
[157 - 161] for the top of the Hat it should should
[161 - 164] fit securely on and then if you're
[164 - 166] wanting to make an Easter basket like
[166 - 169] this all you have to do is is cut a
[169 - 173] section out of each side leaving a
[173 - 175] handle shape down the middle and then
[175 - 177] your child could fill it with things
[177 - 180] that they've made here I've got homemade
[180 - 184] daffodils and decoupage eggs and some
[184 - 187] tissue paper shred or if you're
[187 - 191] interested in making one of the animals
[191 - 197] then your your need and some tissue
[197 - 200] paper shred for their for their fur or
[200 - 204] for their coat now to help you to sit
[204 - 206] the head on top of the body what I
[206 - 209] recommend is that you have used some
[209 - 211] duct tape to make some crisscross shapes
[211 - 214] at the bottom of the head and stick that
[214 - 216] on top of the body so that it's secure
[216 - 218] because what you don't want is for the
[218 - 221] kids to fall off during the Easter
[221 - 228] bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you
[228 - 230] there were three kits available there's
[230 - 233] a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and
[233 - 235] there's a lamb kit and
[236 - 238] come with all materials that you'll need
[238 - 241] to make an Easter bonnet as well as the
[241 - 244] bonnet and a list of instructions to
[244 - 246] help you go through it step by step but
[246 - 248] if you have any questions or any ideas
[248 - 250] that you want to discuss please get in
[250 - 254] touch thank you for watching    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[26 - 29] today is my birthday November 30th
[29 - 32] that is the day I was brought forth into
[32 - 34] this world which is also why I'm all
[34 - 37] dolled up I'm even wearing a party dress
[37 - 39] party dress and I put something in my
[39 - 42] hair it's a hairband and I have makeup
[42 - 43] on which actually feels really
[43 - 44] uncomfortable because I don't really
[44 - 46] wear makeup now because I dismembered
[46 - 48] Thanos all about fun and festivities and
[48 - 50] cake and presents well actually I had no
[50 - 53] fun or festivities plan but I think
[53 - 54] there will be cake and hopefully a
[54 - 57] present or two I have decided to make a
[57 - 59] party hat that's right we are going to
[59 - 61] make a party hat it's arts and crafts
[61 - 63] I'm here at that Colonel Tyson I know
[63 - 66] you all are so excited so without
[66 - 68] further ado let's make a party hat to
[68 - 69] make this project you're gonna need a
[69 - 70] piece of paper
[70 - 72] I chose bread so much is my Percy pretty
[72 - 77] dress and scissors tape glue and
[77 - 79] something to decorate your party hat
[79 - 81] with first you're gonna need to make a
[81 - 84] complete square out of your construction
[84 - 87] paper then you're gonna make your hat
[87 - 89] all you have to do is roll your piece of
[89 - 91] paper into a cone now to do that you
[91 - 96] just roll your paper you're going to
[96 - 101] tape it ever notice how that first piece
[101 - 105] of tape just never feels right now
[105 - 109] you're gonna cut it this paper off I'm
[109 - 111] not the best hat maker and I'm just
[111 - 114] winging it cuz once you have your cowan
[114 - 123] you decorate it
[125 - 125] now I suggest using stickers as well
[125 - 127] especially letter stickers and if you
[127 - 130] were having a birthday party and there
[130 - 131] were a bunch of different kids you could
[131 - 133] put their names on them which is kind of
[133 - 136] cool and certain stickers will add your
[136 - 139] own unique flair to your hat I think
[139 - 140] this is great for birthday parties and
[140 - 142] if I ever have kids it's totally
[142 - 144] something I would do it has some of
[144 - 147] these steampunk ears that I'm going to
[147 - 150] put on my hat okay cool
[150 - 157] Naomi I'm all about being cool
[159 - 159] and now I'm going to put my name on it
[159 - 160] you know so what the other partygoers
[161 - 163] know who I am awesome
[163 - 165] now you just let you have dry for a few
[165 - 170] minutes and of course you have to ensure
[170 - 172] that it was going to stay on your head
[172 - 174] so the best way to do that is to get
[174 - 180] some string or some elastic and thread
[180 - 182] the elastic through for some strange
[182 - 184] reason I cannot find my string and so
[184 - 188] I'm going to use party ribbon and voila
[188 - 191] you have a super awesome personalized
[191 - 195] party hat let me just add my party hat
[195 - 201] onto my head alright here I am what do
[201 - 204] you think I bet you know you will never
[204 - 207] ever buy another party hat because it's
[207 - 210] so simple to make and they look amazing
[210 - 212] talent arts and crafts time is over
[212 - 214] I'm gonna go ahead and say goodbye I
[214 - 215] hope you all have a fabulous day and
[215 - 217] I'll see you all again here next week
[217 - 228] for another edition of back melted and
[228 - 231] then of course you just clean up by
[231 - 234] shoving it all in your desk like this
[234 - 238] and closing it    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[8 - 8] hello and welcome back to the insane
[8 - 10] knitters the YouTube video channel this
[10 - 14] is going to be a demonstration of a flat
[14 - 16] hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a
[16 - 19] lot of hats are knit in the round on a
[19 - 21] cable needle and they they're you know
[21 - 23] you just knit them in a circle and then
[23 - 25] you decrease to the top and you finish
[25 - 27] it that way a flat hat is knit on
[27 - 30] straight needles like this with just a
[30 - 33] large piece of fabric and a lot of
[33 - 35] people make hats this way it does
[35 - 37] involve some seaming and I'll show you
[37 - 41] that but what I'm using here is really
[41 - 43] big needles and really thick yarn this
[43 - 47] is called encore mega and on a size 15
[47 - 48] needle it gives you two stitches per
[48 - 51] inch and that's just something I'm using
[51 - 54] right now and I'll tell you why it makes
[54 - 56] a quick it's a very quick knit just
[56 - 59] quick quick turn it up and it it's very
[59 - 61] thick and you only generally need one
[61 - 64] skein to do this you can use two it
[64 - 67] tells you on the label
[67 - 70] how many yards it is and it's this is
[71 - 73] sixty four yards on and I'm using a
[73 - 76] smaller needle than it calls for so I'm
[76 - 77] getting a little more yardage out of
[77 - 80] this to knit with but that's neither
[80 - 81] here nor there you can use any yarn you
[81 - 83] want for this I'm just using the thick
[83 - 85] yarn and the big needles too to show you
[85 - 88] because it's easier um when you want to
[88 - 90] make a flat hat uh
[90 - 93] like I said you is a thick skein of yarn
[93 - 95] to give me about two stitches per inch
[95 - 98] because it's it's a quick knit and I
[98 - 101] find it easier but you can do this with
[101 - 102] baby yarn you can do this with any yarn
[102 - 105] you want as long as you measure properly
[105 - 107] and that is really the thing you want to
[107 - 110] cast on enough stitches on your needles
[110 - 115] to make the length as high as you want
[115 - 118] the hat to be so if you need the Hat to
[118 - 121] be 10 inches high you know so you've got
[121 - 123] good six inches of coverage on your hat
[123 - 126] then you want to cast on enough stitches
[126 - 131] because this is going to be however
[131 - 134] however why it is is going to be how it
[134 - 138] sits on your head so and then you want
[138 - 141] to knit - however you however long you
[141 - 143] want it to be around generally the most
[143 - 146] average hat is the average person's head
[146 - 149] is about 20 to 22 inches you know the
[149 - 151] kids are obviously smaller than that and
[151 - 153] people come in different sizes so you
[153 - 157] just want to knit as long as you want
[157 - 159] your hat to be around and I'll show you
[159 - 163] why what I have done here is I've knit
[163 - 165] to the point to where I want to bind off
[165 - 168] okay I think this is about 12 inches so
[168 - 170] it's going to make a small hat and now
[170 - 172] I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go
[172 - 173] ahead and do that and I'll come back in
[173 - 175] a minute when I'm bound off and I'll
[175 - 177] show you what and we're back
[177 - 179] okay I have bound off this piece of
[179 - 182] fabric to the last stitch and I'll show
[182 - 185] you what to do now
[185 - 188] we've got our last stitch here and you
[188 - 192] want to finish that up no but you want
[193 - 194] it the thing is is we're going to seam
[194 - 196] this now so you want to instead of just
[196 - 198] cutting this off really close and
[198 - 200] binding it off that way you want to
[200 - 205] leave a long piece long piece of tail
[205 - 206] yarn here because we're going to use
[206 - 210] this piece to sew up the Hat so you want
[210 - 213] to leave really long tail to sew with so
[213 - 217] okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much
[217 - 224] okay and then we're gonna cut this
[226 - 226] and then we're gonna pull it through
[226 - 229] okay so there we go that's our last
[229 - 231] stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn
[231 - 234] through and we're gonna there we go now
[234 - 236] we're bound off completely here okay
[236 - 239] there we go now this is the piece of
[239 - 243] fabric that I knitted and what we're
[243 - 246] going to do is we're going to take a
[246 - 250] yarn needle if you don't have a yarn
[250 - 253] needle they come in various kinds this
[253 - 255] is a large one so because I'm using
[255 - 262] really big yarn here this is the piece I
[262 - 265] knitted okay here's the the cast on edge
[265 - 267] this is where I started knitting and
[268 - 270] then I knit it however long I want my
[270 - 273] hat to be generally this one's about 12
[273 - 278] inches and but you know like I said
[278 - 282] normally you'd knit however long two to
[282 - 284] make it or whoever you're knitting it
[284 - 287] for measuring heads is kind of weird but
[287 - 291] you can do it just you know or you can
[291 - 292] take your best guess like I said the
[292 - 295] average hat the average size is about 20
[295 - 299] to 22 inches depending on on the person
[299 - 303] you're knitting for so here's our our
[303 - 305] cast on edge this is where we started
[305 - 307] Inc this is our cast off edge where we
[307 - 309] stop knitting and this is what we're
[309 - 313] going to do we're going to sew the cast
[313 - 314] on edge
[314 - 317] to the cast-off edge the bind off and
[317 - 320] the bind on we're going to sew those
[320 - 321] together and you're going to end up with
[321 - 324] this two looking thing okay like that so
[324 - 327] you want to take your really long tail
[327 - 330] that you left you also can use another
[330 - 334] piece of yarn to do this you know just
[334 - 336] if you want you can use a different size
[336 - 339] of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I
[339 - 341] used to sew the Hat so that way it
[341 - 347] doesn't show if it gets pulled apart
[347 - 348] okay so here we are we have our yarn
[348 - 353] needle and our yarn and we're going to
[353 - 357] sew these edges together now you can see
[357 - 359] here where your yarn where you bound off
[359 - 361] right there and then you can see the
[361 - 364] edge over here so I generally oh and
[364 - 365] then that's another thing to see this
[365 - 366] pattern I just this is garter stitch
[366 - 368] it's just all knit stitches it's nice
[368 - 370] for hats it's thick it's comfortable but
[370 - 372] you can use any pattern you want you
[372 - 374] don't have to be you don't have to use
[374 - 375] garter stitch I know someone who does
[376 - 377] these in ribbing you can do it every
[377 - 381] pattern you want just remember that one
[381 - 383] side will be inside on the person's head
[383 - 385] and the other side will be on the
[385 - 387] outside so just keep that in mind with
[387 - 389] your pattern but this is just simple
[389 - 390] garter stitch it's all it's knit every
[390 - 392] row just because it works for
[392 - 395] demonstration purposes and also it helps
[395 - 399] me line up what I'm doing here so see
[399 - 400] there's I'm lining up the little rows
[400 - 404] there and now you just take your yarn
[404 - 411] needle and you pick up in between the
[411 - 413] bind off stitches there's these little
[413 - 417] ladders see those right in between each
[417 - 420] of these stitches you can go in and pick
[420 - 423] up that little that little ladder inside
[423 - 426] in it and that really helps you a lot
[426 - 428] when you're sewing and so what we're
[428 - 431] going to do is just seam all the way
[431 - 433] across or I'll show you a couple
[433 - 435] stitches how I do it there's lots of
[435 - 438] ways to do this but this is how I do it
[438 - 441] and so I just come over and I pick up
[441 - 446] the corner first just to secure that
[446 - 452] just to secure them together okay so now
[452 - 454] they're there they're secured they're
[454 - 457] sewn together and then I come in and I
[457 - 463] pick up both sides sorry I bump the
[463 - 465] camera pick up both sides of this stitch
[465 - 470] and both sides of this one and pull that
[470 - 474] through there we go that's sewn together
[474 - 476] this making a flat hat does make a big
[476 - 479] seam down the side and that can be
[479 - 480] uncomfortable for some people when they
[480 - 485] wear stuff but it's just a side effect
[485 - 487] of what this pattern you know of making
[487 - 490] a flat hat so and then that's it I just
[490 - 493] go back and forth I cut this is called
[493 - 495] kind of a whip stitch you just go back
[495 - 500] and forth and sew it up all the way up
[500 - 502] up the sides and you want to make sure
[502 - 506] that you get just about every stitch so
[506 - 510] that way you don't have big holes when
[510 - 514] you when the person puts this hat on so
[514 - 517] see I'm picking up both legs of this
[517 - 520] stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm
[520 - 526] just coming through just like this okay
[526 - 528] and you see how that's being seamed
[528 - 531] together there it's making this little
[531 - 535] making this little line down there down
[535 - 537] the Knitting I'll show you what to do
[537 - 546] with that in a minute so there we go
[548 - 548] see that's another reason I like to use
[548 - 551] the same color of yarn because this way
[551 - 557] it doesn't show very very much
[559 - 559] see when you can tell there's a scene
[559 - 561] there but you can't really see where the
[561 - 564] yarn is because I use the same yarn now
[564 - 565] if I used a different color you could
[565 - 569] really see so pick up both legs of that
[569 - 573] stitch and both legs of the next one and
[573 - 576] come come through
[576 - 579] and I will see you in a minute when I
[579 - 581] get this seemed up in Italy
[581 - 583] okay I'm back I've got this all seem
[583 - 586] down the side now okay
[586 - 587] so now I have this tube see this tube
[587 - 590] thing it's a it's like a it's a tube
[590 - 594] okay and it's not a hat yet but it will
[594 - 596] be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last
[596 - 600] stitch here just like that this is a
[600 - 602] little tail where we started to knit
[602 - 605] remember now this is the part where you
[605 - 607] make your hat okay you're going to
[607 - 611] basically stitch up one of the one of
[611 - 615] the sides here and that's going to close
[615 - 618] one end of the tube and kind of make a
[618 - 621] little hat shape like this okay like
[621 - 623] that so it doesn't look like a hat now
[623 - 625] but when I get this all sewn and I pull
[625 - 628] it really tight it'll make a little hat
[628 - 630] like that and you said you know it's not
[630 - 632] the prettiest thing in the world but it
[632 - 634] does work very well and then you can
[634 - 638] fold this up and and you have a hat for
[638 - 642] whomever you're making it for this is
[642 - 646] the part where their head goes in there
[646 - 649] you go you can fold that up and there's
[649 - 651] the top of the hat so that's how you
[651 - 653] make a flat hat so let's go I'll come
[653 - 655] back just a minute when I get this top
[655 - 658] zone and it's over the top you're going
[658 - 660] to instead of going back and forth like
[660 - 663] we did with this loose with the whip
[663 - 665] stitching you're kind of going to do the
[665 - 667] same thing only you do it on both sides
[668 - 670] so there's where I came out so I'm going
[670 - 673] to go in here like that
[673 - 675] pick up that because this is a different
[675 - 677] edge so it's going to look a little a
[677 - 680] little different because this is a side
[680 - 682] now instead of the bind off edge so
[682 - 684] you're going to go so you came out here
[684 - 686] and then you're going to go back on this
[686 - 689] side and over here like that you make in
[689 - 692] kind of a criss cross one two three four
[692 - 693] instead of going back and forth like
[693 - 698] that so you just go just like this and
[698 - 700] I'll see you in just a second when I get
[700 - 701] this done
[701 - 703] okay I've reached the last stitch now
[703 - 705] and these these are all stitched and I
[705 - 706] went back and forth back and forth and
[706 - 708] now I'm at the last stitch I'm going to
[708 - 711] pull it through and you didn't you don't
[711 - 712] want to seen this too tightly because
[712 - 714] this is what you're going to do now now
[714 - 717] you're gonna pull see you pull that
[717 - 719] really tight like that and see how it
[719 - 722] squishes like that okay you pull it
[722 - 723] really tight and then what I do is I
[723 - 727] take my needle and I just kind of wedge
[727 - 731] it through again just just because guess
[731 - 734] that little gives it a little extra
[734 - 738] tightening okay just like that and you
[738 - 740] can do it again if you want just to use
[740 - 743] up some of the slack on your on your
[743 - 745] needle there or some of the extra yarn
[745 - 748] okay there you go and you know one more
[748 - 752] time why not we're here so there you go
[752 - 755] you pull it tight now you weave in your
[755 - 760] ends
[762 - 762] there's an end and then you pull it
[762 - 765] inside out and there you go you have a
[765 - 770] hat here just a flat hat
[775 - 775] tada you made a hat yay Congrats
[775 - 778] here's your flat head with your ins bulb
[778 - 781] in and there's the broom you can roll it
[781 - 782] up or they can just wear it straight
[782 - 785] they want but there it is
[785 - 789] and that's what the top looks like
[790 - 790] like I said it's not the prettiest thing
[790 - 792] in the world but it's good it's
[792 - 793] functional and you can use whatever
[793 - 798] pattern you want and in it however you
[798 - 798] like
[798 - 802] there you go but    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Preparation when the speaker talks about gathering materials, sizing, planning, scheduling, or giving high-level orientation before hands-on steps.
- Label as Construction when the dominant content is concrete building actions (folding, cutting, measuring, punching, assembling) and step-by-step instructions.
- Label as Finishing when the content covers decorating, drying, trimming, presentation, or wrap-up/closing comments.
- Assign a boundary at the moment the transcript shifts from describing what will be done (Preparation) into concrete manipulation steps (Construction), and again when it shifts from core construction to decoration/closure (Finishing).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[4 - 4] all right okay a nother paper hell - now
[4 - 7] we're going to be making a paper hat and
[7 - 11] do so you will first need to fold the
[11 - 19] paper in half doesn't have to be too
[19 - 25] accurate fold it in half now this bit
[25 - 29] you have to fold over the top half okay
[29 - 34] so that's the middle of the paper you
[34 - 37] can fold it in half gainer sheep just to
[37 - 41] make 9 down the middle that you can see
[41 - 42] okay
[42 - 48] so fold over these top these top pieces
[48 - 56] okay it like you would a paper airplane
[56 - 71] I guess to make this paper hat and it's
[72 - 76] quite a simple thing paper they go what
[76 - 81] more do you need to do opens up how I
[81 - 85] fill it with chips or whatever if you
[85 - 89] want make it look a little neater you
[89 - 101] can fold in these corner pieces and do
[101 - 111] the same on the other side and then
[111 - 116] triangle isn't your style you can then
[116 - 119] fold it down
[119 - 124] and push it in to the little flap there
[124 - 128] and then you have more of a boat shape
[128 - 131] and if you want to make a paper boat
[131 - 134] make a paper boat call it paper boat say
[134 - 136] that's paper foam instead of paper paper
[136 - 142] boat paper paper boat and it also
[142 - 144] doubles up a third thing you put out
[144 - 149] just fold in one of the corners
[149 - 161] I guess corner pieces you fill it with
[161 - 165] water and they have a nice cup which
[165 - 169] will be good for three maybe four uses
[169 - 172] or you can just dry out on a writer if
[173 - 174] you that sort of money and you need
[174 - 178] paper cups all right well that's a nice
[178 - 185] free in one how to paper session there

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[11 - 11] you can use the technique I'm going to
[11 - 15] show you to make a top hat of any size I
[15 - 19] used a cardboard tube but you can use
[19 - 23] construction paper our poster board are
[23 - 26] any material that is stiff enough now I
[26 - 31] started by drawing around the cardboard
[31 - 38] tube at the bottom then I added some
[38 - 44] tabs so that I can glue it onto the two
[44 - 53] after I cut it out it looks like this i
[66 - 66] i glue them on first so later I can
[66 - 71] cover up the tabs takes a few minutes
[71 - 81] sometimes for the glue to dry
[84 - 84] and while we're waiting for that I drew
[84 - 87] around the bottom the same way i placed
[87 - 93] the tube and it's drew a circle around
[93 - 98] it then for the brim I drew a bigger
[98 - 108] circle around that
[111 - 111] and I cut the circle out and in the
[111 - 116] middle I just made a big X I'll show you
[116 - 121] I made a big X like this and I cut on
[121 - 126] those lines so that it looks like that
[126 - 132] did I bending up and the glue goes on
[132 - 140] the inside of these little triangles so
[140 - 143] that you can I mean I'm sorry little bit
[143 - 147] outside because they're going to be
[147 - 153] placed on the inside of the tube put
[153 - 158] those in take your finger and press them
[158 - 164] so that they blew on then the next thing
[164 - 169] idea that I measured this the tube and I
[169 - 172] r is a paper around it to cover it up
[172 - 176] next I cut the little band and it's just
[176 - 178] a little rectangle and you can make it
[178 - 180] as wide or as narrow as you want and
[180 - 184] then I cut strips to make the stripes
[184 - 187] and I put those on before I glued the
[187 - 190] bad don't and i added stars and glitter
[190 - 193] you may not want to but it's up to you
[193 - 195] it sure as you can make it any way you
[195 - 198] want now thanks for watching remember

[44 - 52] like so this is really hard at one hand
[52 - 55] like so then you unfold it again so you
[55 - 57] have a nice line in the middle you fold
[57 - 61] in the corners to that middle line like
[61 - 67] that and like that so it should come
[67 - 71] down like so step 4 should be left at
[71 - 73] these two little flaps at the bottom you

[114 - 116] go to buy a hash don't bother I make
[116 - 121] your own ladies    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hi guys welcome back to origami twist my
[2 - 6] name is Jenna and today's video is one
[6 - 10] that is meant for all of those people
[10 - 13] who have been dealing with snow days and
[13 - 16] born children as a result of the snow
[16 - 19] days now as you probably know I live in
[19 - 21] Australia but I am from the northeastern
[21 - 24] part of the United States and boy oh boy
[24 - 26] have you guys had some weather recently
[26 - 30] whoa Facebook was literally blowing up
[30 - 32] with oh no not another snow day we're
[32 - 34] gonna be going to school in July at this
[34 - 37] rate right oh it's horrible but if
[37 - 40] you've got young children and they're
[40 - 42] stuck inside all day hopefully you got
[42 - 45] up to play in the snow but this
[45 - 47] particular project is great for
[47 - 51] imagination and playing dress-up and
[51 - 53] coming up with stories and ideas and
[53 - 56] basically kicking the kids out of
[56 - 58] boredom and you don't have to be in a
[58 - 62] snow snowy area of the world in order to
[62 - 65] do it it is the classic newspaper paper
[66 - 69] hat so yes you probably already have all
[69 - 70] the materials necessary to make this
[70 - 74] project and say all you need again one
[74 - 77] sheet of newspaper and let's get started
[77 - 82] so I have a what appears to be like a
[82 - 86] half size newspaper and if you've got
[86 - 87] one of those big ones just fold it in
[87 - 88] half and then fold it in half again
[88 - 91] until you have this rectangle about this
[91 - 94] size then the rest of it is really
[94 - 96] really easy you're just gonna fold one
[96 - 100] corner in to make a right triangle there
[101 - 104] you go and you're folding at the middle
[104 - 106] and then you're going to fold the other
[106 - 109] corner in to make another right triangle
[109 - 113] again folding down in the middle so
[113 - 114] you'll have a long skinny strip down
[114 - 118] here and two triangles up top you're
[118 - 120] going to fold this flap up it onto
[120 - 121] itself
[121 - 124] okay let's see how I folded it up onto
[124 - 126] itself to meet the bottom of those
[126 - 130] triangles and then you just fold it up
[130 - 134] again okay now you're going to turn it
[134 - 136] around and do the same thing you're
[136 - 139] gonna fold that bottom flap up so that
[139 - 142] it meets roughly at this point at the
[142 - 145] bottom of the triangle and you should be
[145 - 148] able to tell where that bottom is just
[148 - 150] by looking at the other side so just
[150 - 152] guess it's very rough it doesn't have to
[152 - 154] be perfect and then you're gonna fold
[154 - 158] that rectangle up again so that it
[158 - 161] matches the other side now all that you
[161 - 165] need to do at this stage is open it up
[165 - 169] and as you can see it creates what
[169 - 171] appears to be like a captain's hat
[171 - 173] now I'm sorry I haven't been looking at
[173 - 174] you this whole time I'm trying to see
[174 - 176] myself in the screen I'm not used to
[176 - 177] doing tutorials this way so thank you
[177 - 180] for bearing with me and without further
[180 - 186] ado that's it okay
[186 - 188] now I've got another couple of videos
[188 - 191] that work great with this it's called
[191 - 194] the captain's shirt story it uses this
[194 - 196] as a base and then it turns into a
[196 - 198] really neat interesting story so if
[198 - 200] you're interested in going a bit further
[200 - 202] with this fold let me know in the
[202 - 204] comments below and I'll make videos for
[204 - 208] that so in the comments below yes please
[208 - 211] on the captain's shirt story or whatever
[211 - 213] you know you'd like to put down there
[213 - 215] and thank you so much for watching
[215 - 218] please subscribe if you enjoy paper
[218 - 221] crafting and that sort of thing and I
[221 - 234] hope you guys have a fabulous day bye    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] crafts are a wonderful source of
[2 - 4] entertainment for many people which is
[4 - 8] why making paper hats is very important
[8 - 11] to know first follow you need our
[11 - 16] supplies a piece of paper and a
[16 - 21] measuring device step number one you
[21 - 28] must fold the sheet of paper and half
[31 - 31] and measure it to make sure that's it in
[31 - 36] half yeah about right
[38 - 38] step to hold the people's piece of paper
[38 - 46] so that unfolded side is up step 3 both
[46 - 49] this side up like so but you don't want
[49 - 51] to fold it up all the way because you
[51 - 52] want to have some here some of this
[52 - 54] stuff up you want to have like left over
[54 - 60] here yeah then do the same for the other
[60 - 67] side
[76 - 76] step 4 fold well you have these two left
[76 - 80] flaps here fold one of them down out
[80 - 82] like this please like like this like
[82 - 85] that the priests it all the way across
[85 - 86] and make sure you go all the way across
[86 - 88] from increasing otherwise it's not all
[88 - 93] the way across step 6 just save me the
[93 - 101] other side fold it in crease it up oh no
[101 - 105] no it just a little bit off okay measure
[105 - 107] it to make sure that it's about right
[107 - 110] okay it's right anyhow but looks like

[115 - 118] do this that way it's like see no 3d now
[118 - 121] I have I can be a paper hat a persist
[121 - 124] all speed paper boat another option what
[124 - 126] you can do is fold the sides that like
[126 - 128] oh so that way it's like it doesn't go
[128 - 129] in darkness
[129 - 131] then you have lips like this a finished
[131 - 134] paper hat and the last step is wearing
[134 - 136] it

[7 - 7] hi I'm Jenny Jones and I'm an arts and
[7 - 9] crafts expert I'm here today to show you
[9 - 13] how to make a paper hats
[16 - 16] you can use any paper to make your paper
[16 - 18] hat but I would recommend that you use a
[18 - 21] nice big piece of newspaper or a3 paper
[21 - 24] if you want your hat to fit your head
[24 - 26] you're going to need one full sheet of
[26 - 29] newspaper what you need to do to start
[29 - 31] with is take the top of the paper and
[31 - 35] fold it down make a crease and then I
[35 - 37] want you to take your ruler and you need
[37 - 45] to measure half way draw a line
[47 - 47] place your ruler and your pencil to the
[47 - 50] side and then you're going to take the
[50 - 52] top left-hand corner of the newspaper
[52 - 57] and fold it down to that middle center
[57 - 60] line and make a crease now do the same
[60 - 64] for the other side to the middle and
[64 - 69] make a crease okay and then I want you
[69 - 74] to take the top piece of paper and fold
[74 - 83] it up again make a crease across and you
[83 - 89] need to turn the newspaper over now
[89 - 91] depending how much you fold these size
[91 - 93] bits in or determine whether it'll fit
[93 - 96] your head or not so if it's for myself I
[96 - 102] would fold it in about this much and do
[102 - 107] the same for the other side and then
[107 - 109] lastly you need to fold the other side
[109 - 118] of the paper up to match make a crease
[124 - 124] and there you have it you'll paper hat
[124 - 127] this hat would be absolutely perfect for
[127 - 132] a pirate party or even a sailor party
[137 - 137] and that's how to make a paper hat
[137 - 139] you    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[18 - 18] okay hi guys today we're going to make a
[18 - 22] Mother's Day hat for you and it's for
[22 - 24] Mother's Day coming up on Sunday we're
[24 - 26] gonna have a little Mother's Day Tea
[26 - 28] Party for Jillian's preschool tomorrow
[28 - 31] so we're doing this in preparation for
[31 - 34] that for all the moms in her preschool
[34 - 37] see so it looks really cute on this is
[37 - 40] the finished product and all the moms
[40 - 42] I'm happy to wear it tomorrow so here we
[42 - 44] go so the things that you're going to
[44 - 48] need is one large piece of butcher paper
[48 - 51] or newsprint will work too and then
[51 - 54] you're going to need two sized bowls one
[54 - 58] larger than the other and so two bowls
[58 - 63] scissors stapler really just stapler and
[63 - 68] some tape okay so let's get started so
[68 - 70] first you start off by forming the Hat
[70 - 72] so you need a mold and that's what the
[72 - 74] bowls are going to do I'm going to put
[74 - 76] the bowl underneath the smaller bowl
[76 - 80] goes underneath the paper okay right in
[80 - 82] the center and then Julian can you help
[82 - 86] switch down the paper a little bit okay
[86 - 89] there you go so then you're going to
[89 - 93] place the larger bowl on top
[97 - 97] put your hand up go ahead and push down
[97 - 103] the bolt and that's the uniform that the
[103 - 106] top with the Hat and you kind of just
[106 - 107] spread off the paper
[107 - 110] give me a lot of folding and cutting
[110 - 115] involved with this and stately okay this
[115 - 118] is just getting the shape of the Hat
[118 - 120] once that's down secure then you can
[120 - 127] lift it up there's the top of the half a
[134 - 134] little Bowl still there okay let's put
[134 - 136] it back we don't want to lose our shape
[136 - 138] here so the next thing I'm going to do
[138 - 140] is to secure the shape we're going to
[140 - 142] use some masking tape okay
[142 - 144] so Jillian why don't you hold down this
[144 - 150] paper you hold the top and we're going
[150 - 153] to start just circling around the Hat
[153 - 160] with the tape kind of press it down as
[160 - 168] you go
[173 - 173] good job Jill and then we're gonna have
[173 - 181] to measure it to see if it fits
[185 - 185] okay it's a little bit big so you can
[185 - 190] take it in by folding it a little bit so
[190 - 191] if it's a little big you can just kind
[191 - 196] of fold it over a little bit what we're
[196 - 200] going to do the rim in a second okay and
[200 - 203] then just use some more tape I like to
[203 - 206] put a second row tape on just to make it
[206 - 215] really secure since the paper is very
[215 - 219] large I'm going to trim the edges so we
[219 - 222] have less paper to work with I'm just
[222 - 224] going to go around and trim it kind of
[224 - 230] in a circle okay so now this is the fun
[230 - 233] part with the kids you'll get to make
[233 - 236] the brim of the Hat just like this so it
[236 - 238] has a little brim all around the sides
[238 - 241] make it finished and look nice so what
[241 - 242] they're going to do is just fold around
[242 - 246] and go all the way around okay go ahead
[246 - 246] Jo
[246 - 254] keep folding it up go and turning it and
[254 - 257] kind of go along after them and press it
[257 - 265] down press it down right there you go
[269 - 269] and then I'm going to go around behind
[269 - 272] her and staple it to secure it and it
[272 - 283] doesn't have to be even lots of muscles
[283 - 287] then there's your undecorated hat ready
[287 - 296] to go let's see okay so we're done with
[296 - 299] the hats the only thing left to do is to
[299 - 301] paint them and make them colorful so
[301 - 302] tomorrow we're going to paint them with

[305 - 308] lot of fun right okay so see you
[308 - 344] tomorrow

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 7] Winston you want to show everyone how to
[7 - 11] make a nurse hat no you want to play
[11 - 14] with the container camera okay so today
[14 - 15] I'm going to show you how to make a
[15 - 17] really cute little nurse hat I made
[17 - 19] these for my friend's bachelorette party
[19 - 22] and it was super fun and super easy so
[22 - 24] you start off with for you
[24 - 30] square square my square is I don't know
[30 - 33] I just kind of estimated 21 and a half
[33 - 38] centimeters or eight inches or something
[38 - 39] like that
[39 - 41] eight and a half inches it's a square so
[41 - 44] both sides are the same length okay then
[44 - 47] the top of my square I cut two slits
[47 - 50] again I just kind of estimating it's not
[50 - 53] being a very good in the crafter so it's
[53 - 58] like three inches about or seven
[58 - 61] centimeters obviously it's not super
[61 - 62] duper important how big it is because I
[62 - 64] just asked me to indicate myself anyways
[64 - 66] okay so you have your three slits cut
[66 - 69] with scissors you're going to take these
[69 - 72] two you're going to fold them so that
[72 - 79] they match see the edges match nicely
[79 - 85] and I just use tape this is I just made
[85 - 87] it not too hard because I had to make
[87 - 91] like 15 of them or something so that was
[91 - 96] that once it steeps kind of flaxen edge
[96 - 98] hold the edges now I have a shape like
[98 - 102] this lovely pink then you take the top
[102 - 106] part and fold it over the other two
[106 - 110] parts Erin you take your tape and you do
[110 - 114] the same thing tape fix hold on your
[114 - 118] tape a bit now you have a sheet like
[118 - 122] this
[125 - 125] very good I stuff a little flat cross on
[125 - 128] the top then you're going to look at it
[128 - 131] and you have this big thing so I pulled
[131 - 137] it and folded it again so now I know
[137 - 139] exactly how my nurse hat is going to
[139 - 142] look fake it so just so it has those
[142 - 145] things there then I just kind of need
[145 - 150] little folds on the sides of it when you
[150 - 154] put it on your head it's going to sit
[154 - 156] like a little cap so just trying to bend
[156 - 158] the edges a little bit so see how it
[158 - 161] makes kind of a little pact once you
[161 - 163] have your little edges in then you can
[163 - 170] go ahead and fold your thing back up a
[170 - 176] little bit nurse hat so cute these fit
[177 - 178] on our heads really really well and all
[178 - 180] we did was just stick some bobby pins in
[180 - 181] the back
[181 - 183] JooJoo and they stayed in our head
[183 - 185] really really well if you want to go a
[185 - 187] little bit further you can take some of
[187 - 190] this stuff hmm I chose black before a
[190 - 196] bride we had white and I'm super lazy
[196 - 198] and don't have a lot of crafting
[198 - 203] materials I just used regular tape put
[203 - 207] it on my sail material and dock it in
[207 - 211] the back so it would come out of the
[211 - 213] back of our thing and I put a few layers
[213 - 216] that are always anyway so that's how we
[216 - 217] run around the what the bride had a
[217 - 220] black hat and had a white veil and it
[220 - 222] was super funny and cute and easy and
[222 - 224] everyone loves them
[224 - 227] isn't that right Winston everyone loved
[227 - 235] them even rinsed
[239 - 239] there you go do you like that book no
[239 - 246] Zack Winston yeah didn't you

- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[8 - 9] hey guys bill here and today we're going
[9 - 11] to be making paper hats and I've already
[11 - 14] made one if you want to take a look this
[14 - 16] is what it should and look like a themed
[16 - 20] so I'm going to do it step by step so
[20 - 23] you can use any type of paper you want
[23 - 25] wake up use your newspaper for now i
[25 - 28] would first thing you need to do is to
[28 - 33] make sure that it's amble flat on the
[33 - 37] edges especially even and definitely on
[37 - 39] this side you don't it all like bumpy
[39 - 44] and you do the heart so that's how flat
[44 - 46] it should be and then you want to fold
[46 - 49] it in half again so we fold it like this
[49 - 52] you need to fold it so it's perfectly
[52 - 56] not off the edge so I need to do it like
[56 - 59] that now we have to make sure it's
[59 - 64] flutters down like that playgirl press
[64 - 67] and all the rest out and that's the
[67 - 69] second part and now we need to fold it
[69 - 73] back out to get that was just to give us
[73 - 75] 10 tonight page so now we need to fold
[75 - 78] this part of the paper we just go like
[78 - 80] this we need to make sure it's right on
[80 - 83] the middle right on target that make
[83 - 87] sure top right just like that I mean
[87 - 91] lots of the flowers much as we can there
[91 - 94] we go so you have to do it to the crease
[94 - 96] in the middle that's what the creased is
[96 - 98] fought and now we have to do it to this
[98 - 101] side now straight to the middle make
[101 - 104] sure it's connected to my name is it
[104 - 108] flatten it right now now you have to
[108 - 112] fold this part and just the one part so
[112 - 115] you need that bottom part there and then
[115 - 121] you just phone it to where that is there
[121 - 125] then you have to flatten it down make
[125 - 127] sure the triangles stay down so now we
[127 - 131] have to fold this part or so you get the
[131 - 133] side of the half to make sure perfectly
[133 - 138] flat now we do the opposite side exactly
[138 - 142] the same that's why we have the need the
[142 - 146] this side so we go to the other side and
[146 - 151] fold it half here just make sure
[151 - 155] straight there and then fall it again
[155 - 158] and make sure it's in line with the
[158 - 164] other one with that and then you could
[164 - 170] bleep open it up like that and then we

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] today we're going to make hats oh did
[3 - 5] you see I took off my hat
[5 - 6] that's right take off your hat it'll
[6 - 8] take my dog we're gonna make hats out of
[8 - 12] newspaper and for this all you need is
[12 - 14] newspaper so I'll take one of these one
[14 - 16] sheet while you're there so what do we
[16 - 19] read in today no no no we're just not
[19 - 21] reading we're making hats we're making
[21 - 24] hat so all right so normally a newspaper
[24 - 26] is already folded so we can already
[26 - 27] leave that folded right there
[27 - 29] great just like this and we're going to
[29 - 31] take that and we're going to you know
[31 - 33] they say what did they say when when
[33 - 35] you're folding it there's hot dog and
[35 - 37] hamburger is that right so that's ham
[37 - 40] hamburger is a cross you know so you
[40 - 42] have a wider one and then hotdog would
[42 - 44] be the thinner one right yep
[44 - 46] so what we want to do is we want to give
[46 - 49] one fold in half hamburger style number
[49 - 52] seven all right so then we're making a
[52 - 55] crease right down the middle of it it
[55 - 56] doesn't even it doesn't have to be
[56 - 58] perfect that pair of nothing has to be
[58 - 61] right so now we have a nice crease right
[61 - 63] there right in the middle and now we're
[63 - 66] going to make we're going to fold the
[66 - 68] corners the top two corners where the
[68 - 71] fold is you see that there's already
[71 - 72] pulled down we're going to fold those
[72 - 75] corners in at the half
[75 - 78] like right along that crease so there's
[78 - 81] one side you see and then here's the
[81 - 83] other side and we'll both do them on the
[83 - 89] same same side here so now what you have
[89 - 93] should look like this that's what you
[93 - 95] should be seeing and this should be kind
[95 - 97] of open on the bottom right did you have
[97 - 99] a couple scoops oh how you doing there
[99 - 101] Brian I think I'm doing pretty well
[101 - 105] all right good so now the next step is
[105 - 107] that we're going to see yeah the bottom
[107 - 109] edge around here right here and you see
[109 - 111] how you have two sheets it looks like
[111 - 113] you have two sheets of paper there
[113 - 115] together for we're going to fold the
[115 - 118] first sheet of paper up so just one yeah
[118 - 120] and it's kind of like I guess hot dog
[120 - 123] style you're gonna pull it right all the
[123 - 125] way up make it so it looks like this
[125 - 128] right yeah that's right it's a nice
[128 - 130] thick creaser so then so this is what
[130 - 132] that side should look like is that you
[132 - 134] folded right along this
[134 - 138] were those two triangles where those two
[138 - 140] corners came in and you fold it right up
[140 - 143] along here okay so now you're gonna flip
[143 - 147] it over so you see just the back back
[147 - 150] and now this is where we're gonna size
[150 - 152] it now I have a really big head so I'm
[152 - 155] only gonna do small yeah so I'm gonna
[155 - 158] make I'll make a smaller hat for the
[158 - 159] people on the internet because they
[159 - 160] probably don't have as big a head as I
[160 - 162] do and then you're trying to make a big
[162 - 164] hat so they could fit around your food
[164 - 166] around my head so what what we do here
[166 - 170] is we take these sides the whole side
[170 - 172] right here and we fold it in so here's
[172 - 174] one side we're gonna fold this in you
[174 - 177] know we're Emison as much as our much so
[177 - 180] if you have like a smaller head you can
[180 - 183] fold it in like you know a couple three
[183 - 186] inches right there but if you have a
[186 - 188] bigger head like me you can fold it in
[188 - 191] fold it in just a little bit like that
[191 - 193] now do the same on the other side fold
[193 - 198] it up and in like that make a nice
[198 - 200] little crease so now if you're holding
[200 - 202] them because they're gonna try to flap
[202 - 203] out they look like this so this is what
[203 - 207] your back should look like and then just
[207 - 209] like on the front side you're going to
[209 - 212] fold this right up fold this bottom edge
[212 - 215] right up so now it's all and not on the
[215 - 217] same size but on the opposite so on the
[217 - 219] opposite side so now you'll still have
[219 - 221] that little space right in the middle
[221 - 224] and that's a base that your head goes no
[224 - 228] if you start popping it out a little bit
[228 - 230] you're the Apple about it it fits my
[230 - 232] head does it fit your head I got it
[232 - 236] perfect size the one size fits all it's
[236 - 238] supposed to go to the front leg well you
[238 - 239] can do that whichever way you want it to
[239 - 243] be turned that looks really good musics
[243 - 246] great awesome well that's how we make a
[246 - 247] paper right now there are other things
[247 - 250] we can do with this what can we do we
[250 - 252] can put little things in this little in
[252 - 253] the little room in your little brim you
[253 - 255] can have things hanging out and you will
[255 - 260] decorate your hats in fact I'm going to
[260 - 263] add something you have okay I'm gonna
[263 - 266] make it funnier funny hats no no you're
[266 - 271] yo little a nice little I my third
[271 - 273] googly eye there and their way here I
[273 - 275] have another one okay we need to get as
[275 - 277] many eyes as we can right and then
[277 - 280] another googly eye there right now your
[280 - 291] hat has eyes awesome
[302 - 302] alright by the way that is our crafty
[302 - 310] mid cross craft craft

- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[7 - 7] hi my name is Laura I'm an artist and
[7 - 8] I'm going to show you how to make a
[8 - 11] three sided paper hat what you're going
[11 - 14] to need is a sheet of paper I have an
[14 - 16] eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper
[16 - 19] it's going to make a small hat so if you
[19 - 21] want to make a larger hat use a larger
[21 - 22] sheet of paper
[22 - 25] so first the first step is you're gonna
[25 - 29] fold the paper in half lengthwise like
[29 - 33] this after you fold it use your
[33 - 38] fingernail to to make that fold sharper
[38 - 42] and then what you're going to do is make
[42 - 44] sure that the folded side is away from
[44 - 49] you the open edges toward you fold the
[49 - 52] upper right and left hand corners in
[52 - 53] toward each other so that they meet in
[53 - 56] the middle and then do a sort of
[56 - 60] temporary temporary fold and then again
[60 - 62] sharpen that with your fingernail on
[62 - 68] both sides and you'll have flaps left
[68 - 70] facing towards you what you're going to
[70 - 76] do is fold one side up on one side
[76 - 79] fingernail it down and then flip it over
[79 - 83] and take that other flap up on the other
[83 - 90] side and then you have one two three
[90 - 95] corners on your hat and you can put it
[95 - 99] on your head like that I am Laura thank
[99 - 101] you for watching how to make a three
[101 - 105] sided paper hat

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hey everybody this is gonna be a
[2 - 5] tutorial on how to make a paper hat so
[5 - 7] the first step is you want to draw three
[7 - 10] shapes that look like this now the first
[10 - 13] shape you draw is gonna have a curve
[13 - 16] right there and then the second one is
[16 - 19] gonna be a little bit less curved but a
[19 - 21] slant going up there but a small slit
[21 - 23] and then the third is going to be the
[23 - 25] smallest piece and the less curved on
[25 - 27] the edge once you have this drawing out
[27 - 28] what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut
[28 - 31] each one out after you cut them out
[31 - 32] you're gonna have three of these and
[32 - 35] you're gonna take one of them put them
[35 - 37] on a white piece of paper and trace
[37 - 39] around because what you're doing is
[39 - 41] you're you're making two of each shape
[41 - 43] and so you're making sure that each one
[43 - 45] is the same size as the one before
[45 - 47] because if it's not the hats not gonna
[47 - 54] fit together correctly and once you have
[54 - 56] all those traced what you're gonna do is
[56 - 58] take some scissors and you're gonna cut
[58 - 63] each one out this is the time to color
[63 - 66] them and if you want to once you have
[66 - 67] them all cut out what you're gonna do is
[67 - 69] you're gonna take one of them and you're
[69 - 71] gonna draw lines like this around the
[71 - 73] edge these represent the seams of the
[73 - 76] Hat and if you want to you can also do a
[76 - 79] dotted line for these instead but you
[79 - 82] can do it however you want and you're
[82 - 88] gonna do that for every single one
[90 - 90] make sure that for these pieces the two
[90 - 92] largest ones the slant is going down on
[92 - 94] that side and going up on that one it's
[94 - 98] almost like a mirror image once you have
[98 - 100] them all drawn on what you're gonna do
[100 - 103] is you're gonna take these to make sure
[103 - 105] it's those two take a piece of tape tape
[105 - 107] on the back and then you're gonna put
[107 - 109] together you are now starting to put the
[109 - 115] Hat together take another piece of tape
[115 - 117] and put it on the back and put them
[117 - 119] together you're gonna be doing this for
[119 - 122] each one just make sure that you don't
[122 - 124] tape too close to the top because when
[124 - 126] you're done sometimes it doesn't fit
[126 - 129] together quite right so you want to make
[129 - 130] sure you have enough room if you need to
[130 - 133] adjust now the next two pieces is you
[133 - 136] want to put ones of the smallest ones on
[136 - 138] one side and the other smallest piece on
[138 - 141] the other side each side has to be
[141 - 142] symmetrical because if you don't put
[142 - 144] them in to get together in the right
[144 - 145] order the hats not going to come out
[145 - 147] right so you have to make sure you're
[147 - 151] doing it in this order and then take
[151 - 154] that other small piece and attach it to
[154 - 173] the other side like that
[175 - 175] now for the two largest pieces which are
[175 - 176] the two lost you have to be careful
[176 - 179] about this make sure that the slants on
[179 - 181] this are going kind of in the mirror
[181 - 184] image again going opposite but then
[184 - 185] after that you just do what you've been
[185 - 187] doing the whole time taping on the back
[187 - 191] and then putting together like this just
[191 - 193] like that just make sure that the slants
[193 - 201] are going the opposite direction
[204 - 204] these two last pieces are usually the
[204 - 206] most difficult to put together because
[206 - 207] everything is a little bit crowded
[207 - 210] because it's making the circular shape
[210 - 214] so it may be a little bit difficult in
[214 - 216] the video you can tell that I'm gonna
[216 - 219] have a little bit of trouble with it but
[219 - 221] it seemed pretty easy to work around but
[221 - 225] just keep taping to the back and then
[225 - 231] putting it together like that and if you
[231 - 233] have a gap at the top that's completely
[233 - 235] fine or if you have a little bit of tape
[235 - 241] left over there don't worry about it and
[241 - 243] if you do have any extra tape up there
[243 - 245] what you can do is just take some
[245 - 247] scissors and cut off the extra tape and
[247 - 248] don't worry about that gap at the top
[248 - 252] because that's gonna be covered up later
[252 - 254] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[254 - 256] take some cardboard make sure it's thin
[256 - 257] cardboard you can use anything you want
[257 - 259] as you can see here I use some Ritz
[259 - 262] cardboard so you can do anything you
[262 - 269] really want make about six tabs like
[269 - 272] that you you actually really only need
[272 - 277] four but um I'm just doing that in case
[277 - 279] I mess out so then take some tape you
[279 - 281] can bend it too it might make it easier
[281 - 283] and then put it in like that and just
[283 - 287] keep taping around the entire hat this
[287 - 288] is to make the Hat more sturdy and it
[288 - 292] also gives the Hat the round shape so
[292 - 294] that if you wear it it won't crumble or
[294 - 297] anything when you put it on and so just
[297 - 299] keep taping around the top and bottom
[299 - 300] make sure they're on there correctly
[300 - 303] make sure they won't fall off and you
[303 - 305] may notice you can see through the white
[305 - 307] hat to the cardboard but that's fine if
[307 - 309] you have your head actually colored in
[309 - 311] right now you um you probably can't even
[311 - 315] see it so it's fine now what you're
[315 - 317] gonna do is you're gonna make the brim
[317 - 319] for that so put the Hat down like that
[319 - 322] and you're gonna make kind of a half
[322 - 328] circle like this yeah and kind of draw
[328 - 331] it in lightly in case you mess up so you
[331 - 333] can erase it and there won't be any left
[333 - 334] over
[334 - 338] marks and once you have it right or how
[338 - 341] you like it just go around and darken it
[341 - 345] back in like that and then put the hat
[346 - 348] back on and you're just gonna make a
[348 - 351] half circle around the edges like this
[351 - 357] and by now which it look like a half
[357 - 361] moon and then just darken it in and then
[361 - 364] once you have it all darken in you're
[364 - 367] gonna cut it out with some scissors and
[367 - 370] this is when you can color the Birman if
[370 - 373] you want to now what we're gonna do is
[373 - 376] you're gonna take some pencil and you're
[376 - 378] gonna draw some lines like this these
[378 - 383] represent the seams of the brim so just
[383 - 389] draw it around like that you can also do
[389 - 392] these dotted lines here instead if you
[392 - 395] want but you can do it any way and just
[395 - 398] keep doing that but before you get to
[398 - 401] the very end about this point stop and
[401 - 406] just leave that area blank in there now
[406 - 407] you're gonna take some cardboard and
[407 - 412] you're gonna trace around the paper it's
[412 - 414] okay if the cardboard is a little bit
[414 - 417] too small as you can see here I have him
[417 - 418] used a little bit too small a piece but
[418 - 420] it's fine just make sure it's not too
[420 - 422] small and then you're gonna cut it out
[422 - 425] because this is gonna make the brim more
[425 - 428] stiff
[430 - 430] and then you're gonna take some glue
[430 - 433] glue the cardboard and then you're just
[433 - 437] gonna put the brim the paper broom onto
[437 - 443] the cardboard
[446 - 446] once you're done with that you can flip
[446 - 449] it over and if you have any writing like
[449 - 453] here and writing like that what you do
[453 - 457] is you trace around and then you cut
[457 - 459] that out and then you're just gonna put
[459 - 460] it over the words or whatever there is
[460 - 462] there so you don't see it and then put
[462 - 464] it down like that and if you can still
[464 - 466] see through you just do it again
[466 - 469] and then you won't be able to see it now
[469 - 470] what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[470 - 473] make sure that shape is the same shape
[473 - 475] you see on the Hat it has to be that
[475 - 478] shape because that's the front tape the
[478 - 487] brim put a few pieces on and tape it to
[487 - 490] the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on
[490 - 499] straight
[502 - 502] now you're gonna fill that gap in so
[502 - 505] take some paper cut out a square
[505 - 511] rectangular shape and you're gonna glue
[511 - 520] the inside of the Hat like this
[523 - 523] and then Pat that down inside and then
[523 - 533] you can't see through anymore like that
[536 - 536] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[536 - 538] make the airholes for that so take some
[538 - 541] paper and draw six circles and put dark
[541 - 545] dots in the middle of each one and then
[545 - 552] cut them out
[554 - 554] once you have them all cut out take some
[554 - 557] glue glue the bottom of them and paste
[557 - 574] them on in these areas on the Hat
[577 - 577] now we're gonna make the very top of the
[577 - 581] Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a
[581 - 584] strip about this big I actually think I
[584 - 587] made it a little bit too long take some
[587 - 590] glue glue the end and make a circle
[590 - 593] shape about this size and glue both ends
[593 - 600] together once you have that done take a
[600 - 602] piece of paper cut out a circle about
[602 - 609] this big take the other piece glue the
[609 - 614] bottom put that on top and then once you
[614 - 619] get that on glue the other side you
[619 - 620] might want to use a little bit more glue
[620 - 622] than I did here and then put that on the
[622 - 627] top right there now this is the point
[627 - 630] when you can put logos on here here here
[630 - 633] I used EC and a bunch of them but you
[633 - 635] can do anything you want and also you
[635 - 637] can go online print this sticker off
[637 - 641] glue the back and put it on the brim to
[641 - 644] give it a more realistic look and there
[644 - 647] you go there's your hat if you have any
[647 - 649] questions you can message me and I'll
[649 - 652] answer anything if you want you can also
[652 - 654] put your video of your hat as a video
[654 - 657] response to this I'd love to see it good
[657 - 659] luck    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hey you volunteered solo shot and today
[2 - 2] I'm going to show you guys how to make
[2 - 8] paper hats
[11 - 11] this is a very simple tutorial but I
[11 - 13] promise it will be very useful because
[13 - 15] it saved me from boredom multiple times
[15 - 17] and you will thank you for it later
[17 - 19] alright so the only material that you
[19 - 21] can need for this tutorial is one piece
[21 - 25] of paper and so first you're going to
[25 - 28] place your paper down with a landscape
[28 - 30] orientation and then you're going to
[30 - 36] fold it in half vertically then you're
[36 - 38] going to take the top corners and fold
[38 - 41] them into the senton and make sure that
[41 - 47] they are touching
[49 - 49] and after that you're going to fold up
[49 - 51] the little bottom part that it holds
[51 - 54] over top of the corners that you just
[54 - 55] fold it in and you're going to do that
[55 - 62] on both sides
[64 - 64] then all you have to do is just open it
[64 - 66] up from the bottom and bam there you
[66 - 71] have it making paper hats are great way
[71 - 72] to pass the time when you're bored and
[72 - 76] they also make very stylish head hope
[76 - 78] you enjoyed the tutorial and thanks for
[78 - 81] watching

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] all right so today I gotta make it this
[2 - 7] mini seven head and is very simple so
[7 - 10] we're gonna get any size of paper that
[10 - 11] you'd like it to
[11 - 15] I'm a rectangular and I decided to use
[15 - 19] this palm-sized getting a hand sized up
[19 - 22] paper so now the first thing you do is
[22 - 27] fold it into half like this increase it
[27 - 32] well next you're gonna fold into half
[32 - 38] again now you're gonna make it into four
[38 - 40] segments so you're gonna fight it but
[40 - 43] not a half and the other side waiting
[43 - 49] like this
[51 - 51] you sure you've got four segments now
[51 - 53] and what you're gonna do
[53 - 57] is that you're going to UM open it up
[57 - 67] and flip into half monkey this
[70 - 70] Kalish you've got eight segments now so
[70 - 73] you're gonna foot down
[73 - 77] one two three down and then you're gonna
[77 - 87] fold it up the half like this

[271 - 273] for watching goodbye    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] I'm going to show you how to make this
[3 - 6] fun bowlers hat for Saint Patrick's Day
[6 - 8] or any other occasion for which you
[8 - 10] would need a bowlers hat the first thing
[10 - 11] you're going to need is your newspaper
[11 - 14] base that's done with one that has a
[14 - 17] deep Bowl for the Hat put it out on the
[18 - 20] table you get it as flat as you can
[20 - 23] around the edges and once you have that
[23 - 25] done you're simply going to start
[25 - 29] rolling the edges up and just gonna roll
[29 - 33] all the way around because you're kind
[33 - 36] of preparing this newspaper to be your
[36 - 39] bowlers hat once you've gone around the
[39 - 44] first time go ahead and start taping it
[44 - 47] all the way around you might have to
[47 - 49] take fairly often but you might not it
[49 - 52] depends on your newspaper once you've
[52 - 53] gotten your hat to the point where you
[53 - 57] taped it all up you can look at it and
[57 - 61] see if it's in as close as you want and
[61 - 65] has that bowler hat look to it once you
[65 - 68] have done that you're going to want to
[68 - 71] take tempera paint or any other paint I
[71 - 73] took this tempered paint put it in a big
[73 - 76] paper plate and use the large brush to
[76 - 79] paint the whole hat newspaper is very
[79 - 81] thin paper and it takes a long time to
[81 - 83] dry so you want to make sure your hat is
[83 - 85] completely dry before you start
[85 - 87] decorating it but in the meantime you
[87 - 89] can cut out what you're going to use to
[89 - 94] make your decorations I use simply three
[94 - 96] hearts that I cut out of construction
[96 - 101] paper and I made them the same size so I
[101 - 105] use the first one as a template cut the
[105 - 116] second one and cut the third one
[122 - 122] and for these I covered them with
[122 - 126] Elmer's glue and then I sprinkled green
[126 - 131] glitter on them and let it dry and once
[131 - 135] that was done I put them together three
[135 - 137] hearts with a little dab of glue I'll
[137 - 138] put a little piece of tape that'll give
[138 - 143] you the idea and my shamrock was ready
[143 - 146] to go from my bowlers hat then once my
[146 - 149] hat was dry I started making that other
[149 - 152] decorations for it no there's your
[152 - 154] shamrock to go in the middle of your hat
[154 - 159] I used shamrock confetti and I used
[159 - 163] glitter glue and I just made some
[163 - 165] decorations around the brim of the Hat
[165 - 169] took my Elmer's glue and put on the
[169 - 171] confetti and glued the shamrock to the
[171 - 173] middle with a little piece of confetti
[173 - 175] now you can of course make a bowlers hat
[175 - 178] any color for any occasion but this is
[178 - 183] how I made a st. Patrick's Day bowler
[183 - 187] hat out of newspaper    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats this very
[8 - 10] fun party hat is made out of only three
[10 - 13] pieces of construction paper this is the
[13 - 15] smaller paper the first thing you want
[15 - 21] to do is take the smaller paper and just
[21 - 26] wrap it around your head until it fits
[26 - 32] and tape or staple it nothing to it
[32 - 37] really once you have your hat secured
[37 - 39] might want to take a special pair of
[39 - 42] scissors but the fancy edges and cut
[42 - 44] around the edge so that you have an edge
[44 - 47] that looks like this and you know if you
[47 - 49] don't have the fancy scissors to do this
[49 - 51] kind of an edge you can always just tear
[51 - 54] the paper and that too will give you a
[54 - 57] fancy edge now one thing that you can do
[57 - 60] too before you even cut out your hat
[60 - 63] before you staple it is to leave it open
[63 - 66] and decorate it you might want to write
[66 - 70] happy birthday and crayon or use markers
[70 - 73] or even use glitter and glue once you've
[73 - 75] done that you put your hat together and
[75 - 78] then you want to make this this is the
[78 - 82] fun stuff and it's so easy to make cut
[82 - 84] out a variety of sizes and colors of
[84 - 87] circles and then just start cutting out
[87 - 89] your circle you want to stay fairly
[89 - 92] close to the edge but it does not have
[92 - 95] to be even that's the beauty of it and
[95 - 97] you just keep cutting until you keep
[97 - 101] Spile spiraling around and you have it
[101 - 103] looking like this and then you take the
[103 - 109] center and stretch it as you can see I
[109 - 111] used several pieces of yellow and
[111 - 114] several pieces of purple I started out
[114 - 116] with a large circle with the purple and
[116 - 119] this was a small circle with the yellow
[119 - 122] put them all together staple them at the
[122 - 128] top shook them out and here we go a
[128 - 131] really fun crazy
[131 - 134] happy birthday hat it would work for new
[134 - 136] to

[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats are Dan
[8 - 11] welcome to Pirates Cove mateys we're
[11 - 13] going to make a very simple pirate hat
[13 - 17] out of a newspaper you know went three
[17 - 19] sheets of newspaper you can use two but
[19 - 22] three sheets gives you a more sturdy hat
[22 - 25] that are two-sided all the way no half
[25 - 27] sheets lay it out in front of you
[27 - 31] sideways with your fold at the front and
[31 - 34] you're going to find the middle and then
[34 - 39] fold it down to the middle not quite
[39 - 43] centered up and down again leaving a
[43 - 45] little bit of space at the top so that
[45 - 48] it's even and then you're simply going
[48 - 52] to take the first three sheets one two
[52 - 64] three and fold them up and crease it
[66 - 66] [Applause]
[66 - 70] turn it over fold up the next three
[70 - 75] sheets and then fasten it I put mine on
[75 - 79] my head and then stapled it right at the
[79 - 81] sides of my head so that it would stay
[81 - 85] on my head and fit you can do that with
[85 - 90] your hat too now you have your base for
[90 - 95] your pirate hat and what I did with mine
[95 - 100] was to use black construction paper to
[100 - 102] cover the front of it but you could also
[102 - 104] use black tempera paint and I stuck it
[104 - 107] down in the Hat band and then I made a
[107 - 110] skull and crossbones and glued it on
[110 - 112] you're going to make a skull and
[112 - 115] crossbones basically you want to make
[115 - 124] kind of a light bulb shape and put the
[124 - 127] two circles for the eyes you're going to
[127 - 130] have your teeth come down again kind of
[130 - 135] to a point and have teeth and your nose
[135 - 145] make them black make your bones
[154 - 154] cut them out glue them on and voila you
[154 - 159] have a pirate's hat pretty simple huh

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[21 - 21] decorate your mash a pirate ship using
[21 - 23] acrylic paint you can have lots of fun
[23 - 25] coming up with a really piratey color
[25 - 32] scheme
[36 - 36] the next step is to fold your card in
[36 - 39] half this is going to create the larger
[39 - 42] waves to go around the outside of your
[42 - 45] hat fold it in half and then we're going
[45 - 60] to draw the wave shape along the paper
[63 - 63] this time to make the smaller waves fold
[63 - 66] your paper in half along the long side
[66 - 78] of the paper and then fold it again
[81 - 81] so you'll find this is slightly more
[81 - 83] difficult to cut through because there's
[83 - 87] four layers of card to cut through so
[87 - 88] you may have to be a bit tougher with
[88 - 92] your scissors but it's well worth it
[92 - 94] because the effect is fantastic at the
[94 - 97] end cut the leaves down the center along
[97 - 106] the fold
[108 - 108] if you have a little extra on the bottom
[108 - 110] you could always just sand that off
[110 - 113] using your glue gun run a line of glue
[113 - 119] along the bottom of your boat and then
[119 - 124] securely attaches to the Hat you'll need
[124 - 125] to hold this in place for a few minutes
[125 - 129] just so it sticks securely so it doesn't
[129 - 130] matter if it's completely straight
[130 - 132] because waves are choppy so it just adds
[132 - 135] to the sea effect next we're going to
[135 - 137] attach the waves to the Hat I'm going to
[137 - 139] use a glue gun but you could use a
[139 - 143] stapler Sini's stick lots of glue onto
[143 - 148] your waves and mold it to the shape of
[148 - 153] the Hat holding it firmly you might need
[153 - 156] to cut your waves to size so it fits
[156 - 163] around the Hat it doesn't matter if it
[163 - 165] overlaps a little bit because the other
[165 - 166] waves are going to go around the edge
[166 - 169] next we're going to attach our smaller
[169 - 174] waves around the edge of the Hat we're
[174 - 175] going to use exactly the same processes
[175 - 180] the larger waves gluing just over the
[180 - 185] top to give this layered effect you will
[185 - 187] need an adult's help with the glue gun
[187 - 189] because it does get very hot I'm going
[189 - 195] to add some treasure to my bonnet you
[195 - 196] can put it wherever you fancy so it
[196 - 199] could be around the boat or it could be
[199 - 200] at the bottom of the ocean it's
[200 - 204] completely up to you and firmly place
[204 - 208] the coins onto the Hat
[208 - 210] if you have any overlapping sections in
[210 - 212] your waves you could always put one of
[212 - 217] the coins over the top so when you stuck
[217 - 218] on your coins
[218 - 221] it obviously adds some sparkle to your
[221 - 228] hat we're going to add the bunting so
[228 - 230] you can attach this however you like you
[230 - 231] could use as little or as much as you
[231 - 233] like so I'm going to attach it the top
[233 - 238] just with a little blob of glue and you
[238 - 241] can cut off any excess just adds the
[241 - 260] finishing touches to your pirate ship    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[65 - 67] add some sellotape so that it doesn't
[67 - 71] move then take a mixture of 3/4 part of
[71 - 73] glue and 1/4 part of water and apply a
[73 - 75] layer of newspaper on half of the
[75 - 80] balloon
[103 - 103] [Music]
[103 - 107] when you're done keep this to dry let it
[107 - 111] dry completely once try apply a second
[111 - 113] layer of newspaper and then leave that
[113 - 116] to dry as well
[120 - 120] and when the second layer of newspaper
[120 - 123] dries pop the balloon so that you get
[123 - 127] this dome-like shape now take a chart
[127 - 129] paper and place the dome on it in the
[129 - 133] center and Mark points then take a plate
[133 - 135] and draw a circle connecting these
[135 - 139] points then draw a smaller circle inside
[139 - 142] the circle and then a bigger on the
[142 - 146] outside
[149 - 149] so now we have one small one medium and
[149 - 151] one big circle out of which the medium
[151 - 154] one is exactly the size of the dome now
[154 - 162] cut out the circle
[173 - 173] [Music]
[173 - 177] then from the inside circle cut slits to
[177 - 180] the middle circle
[188 - 188] now fold the paper like so
[188 - 195] [Music]
[198 - 198] so take the gnome and cut slits on that
[198 - 204] as well and fold them outwards
[222 - 222] the apply glue on these little portions
[222 - 225] and then place the chart paper on it and
[225 - 232] stick it well
[234 - 234] [Music]
[234 - 237] then apply glue on these little portions
[237 - 239] of the chart paper and stick it on the
[239 - 243] dome
[250 - 250] [Music]
[250 - 253] once that is done leave it to dry
[253 - 258] overnight so that the dome hardens then
[258 - 260] paint it with your favourite colour I

[262 - 265] make sure to paint the side as well as
[265 - 268] even this will be showing then apply

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] in this clip I'm going to show you how
[2 - 5] to make a paper top hat you're gonna
[5 - 8] take a piece of paper a paper plate here
[8 - 10] you can take your scissors and you're
[10 - 12] going to cut out the middle by carefully
[12 - 15] poking the scissors through the top and
[15 - 19] cutting leaving a little bit of the
[19 - 23] paper plate on the top and notice that I
[23 - 26] turned the paper plate over or upside
[26 - 31] down I quickly cut that out all the way
[31 - 34] around and then I'm going to take just a
[34 - 37] regular piece of construction paper and
[37 - 39] I'm going to fold down the top just a
[39 - 42] little bit to give it some sturdy nuts
[42 - 46] because I want it to really hold
[46 - 48] together well I'm gonna put a glue stick
[48 - 53] on here pull that down and then I'm
[53 - 56] going to also fold up the bottom about a
[56 - 58] half of an inch and this is going to
[58 - 65] allow the paper top-hat to fit inside of
[65 - 66] the paper plate and I'm going to cut
[66 - 69] little slits around here which will help
[69 - 75] mold it into a circle okay the last
[75 - 76] thing I want to do is I want to overlap
[76 - 78] these so I'm going to put a little bit
[78 - 80] of glue here and I'm going to go ahead
[80 - 87] and put these two together like that and
[87 - 91] there take a piece of tape and put this
[91 - 93] right in the middle where I'm
[93 - 96] overlapping it just to support it a
[96 - 98] little bit now I'm going to put this
[98 - 102] right inside of my paper plate and I'm
[102 - 104] going to turn it upside down and I'm
[104 - 108] going to start gluing these tabs onto
[108 - 112] the paper plate just like you see here
[112 - 115] and I'm going to go ahead and show you
[115 - 118] that this last one and I want to support
[118 - 122] it again with a piece of tape and the
[122 - 125] very last thing I'm going to do is I'm
[125 - 128] going to take my magic marker and I'm
[128 - 130] going to go ahead and make that brim
[130 - 135] black and you have a great top hat    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] hi in this video I'm going to show you
[3 - 6] how you can create an imaginative Easter
[6 - 8] bonnet with your child using simple
[8 - 12] paper mache techniques first of all you
[12 - 15] need a balloon if you're making
[15 - 17] something like this out of an egg shape
[17 - 20] or if you want to make an animal or a
[20 - 23] bird you'll need a small balloon for the
[23 - 26] head and a larger balloon for the body
[26 - 33] so first of all you need to inflate the
[33 - 36] large balloon sit it in a saucepan or
[36 - 40] bowl so it sits securely while you're
[40 - 44] applying the strips of newspaper I've
[44 - 48] cut mine into 1 by 5 inch strips but you
[48 - 50] don't have to be approximate that's only
[50 - 52] approximate you don't have to do it
[52 - 55] exactly the other thing you'll need is a
[55 - 58] pot of PVA glue which has some water in
[58 - 60] so it's running and you'll need a
[60 - 63] paintbrush and your meal apron that will
[63 - 65] cover your child because it can get
[65 - 69] messy so what I recommend is that you
[69 - 71] get your child to cover an area of the
[71 - 75] balloon with glue and I'll show you that
[75 - 79] it should just run on the balloon quite
[79 - 82] easily and then when you've covered an
[82 - 86] area the balloon in PVA close then apply
[86 - 89] strips running in the same direction all
[89 - 95] around the balloon then apply another
[95 - 98] another layer of glue put on the strip's
[98 - 101] going in the opposite direction
[101 - 103] overlapping slightly so there are no
[103 - 107] gaps and then your third layer will go
[108 - 110] back to the original direction and then
[110 - 112] I recommend that for the final layer you
[112 - 116] apply some kitchen towel strips or some
[116 - 118] paper to have strips and because this
[119 - 122] provides a really good base for
[122 - 126] painting it helps it make sure that the
[126 - 128] print doesn't show through or it
[128 - 130] provides a good base if you're wanting
[130 - 135] to put squares of tissue paper onto the
[135 - 139] balloon so after about 24 hours in a
[139 - 142] really warm place your balloon will
[142 - 146] hopefully dry so that it's it's it's
[146 - 154] very solid pop the balloon and cut up a
[154 - 157] circular hole in the bottom large enough
[157 - 161] for the top of the Hat it should should
[161 - 164] fit securely on and then if you're
[164 - 166] wanting to make an Easter basket like
[166 - 169] this all you have to do is is cut a
[169 - 173] section out of each side leaving a
[173 - 175] handle shape down the middle and then
[175 - 177] your child could fill it with things
[177 - 180] that they've made here I've got homemade
[180 - 184] daffodils and decoupage eggs and some
[184 - 187] tissue paper shred or if you're
[187 - 191] interested in making one of the animals
[191 - 197] then your your need and some tissue
[197 - 200] paper shred for their for their fur or
[200 - 204] for their coat now to help you to sit
[204 - 206] the head on top of the body what I
[206 - 209] recommend is that you have used some
[209 - 211] duct tape to make some crisscross shapes
[211 - 214] at the bottom of the head and stick that
[214 - 216] on top of the body so that it's secure
[216 - 218] because what you don't want is for the
[218 - 221] kids to fall off during the Easter
[221 - 228] bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you
[228 - 230] there were three kits available there's
[230 - 233] a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and
[233 - 235] there's a lamb kit and
[236 - 238] come with all materials that you'll need
[238 - 241] to make an Easter bonnet as well as the
[241 - 244] bonnet and a list of instructions to
[244 - 246] help you go through it step by step but
[246 - 248] if you have any questions or any ideas
[248 - 250] that you want to discuss please get in
[250 - 254] touch thank you for watching

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[6 - 6] some of you might be wondering why I'm
[6 - 9] dressed up well it's my birthday happy
[9 - 15] birthday to me happy birthday to me
[15 - 22] happy birthday to that girl Tyson happy
[22 - 26] birthday to me that's right
[26 - 29] today is my birthday November 30th
[29 - 32] that is the day I was brought forth into
[32 - 34] this world which is also why I'm all
[34 - 37] dolled up I'm even wearing a party dress
[37 - 39] party dress and I put something in my
[39 - 42] hair it's a hairband and I have makeup
[42 - 43] on which actually feels really
[43 - 44] uncomfortable because I don't really
[44 - 46] wear makeup now because I dismembered
[46 - 48] Thanos all about fun and festivities and
[48 - 50] cake and presents well actually I had no
[50 - 53] fun or festivities plan but I think
[53 - 54] there will be cake and hopefully a
[54 - 57] present or two I have decided to make a
[57 - 59] party hat that's right we are going to
[59 - 61] make a party hat it's arts and crafts
[61 - 63] I'm here at that Colonel Tyson I know
[63 - 66] you all are so excited so without
[66 - 68] further ado let's make a party hat to
[68 - 69] make this project you're gonna need a
[69 - 70] piece of paper
[70 - 72] I chose bread so much is my Percy pretty
[72 - 77] dress and scissors tape glue and
[77 - 79] something to decorate your party hat
[79 - 81] with first you're gonna need to make a
[81 - 84] complete square out of your construction
[84 - 87] paper then you're gonna make your hat
[87 - 89] all you have to do is roll your piece of
[89 - 91] paper into a cone now to do that you
[91 - 96] just roll your paper you're going to
[96 - 101] tape it ever notice how that first piece
[101 - 105] of tape just never feels right now
[105 - 109] you're gonna cut it this paper off I'm
[109 - 111] not the best hat maker and I'm just
[111 - 114] winging it cuz once you have your cowan
[114 - 123] you decorate it
[125 - 125] now I suggest using stickers as well
[125 - 127] especially letter stickers and if you
[127 - 130] were having a birthday party and there
[130 - 131] were a bunch of different kids you could
[131 - 133] put their names on them which is kind of
[133 - 136] cool and certain stickers will add your
[136 - 139] own unique flair to your hat I think
[139 - 140] this is great for birthday parties and
[140 - 142] if I ever have kids it's totally
[142 - 144] something I would do it has some of
[144 - 147] these steampunk ears that I'm going to
[147 - 150] put on my hat okay cool
[150 - 157] Naomi I'm all about being cool
[159 - 159] and now I'm going to put my name on it
[159 - 160] you know so what the other partygoers
[161 - 163] know who I am awesome
[163 - 165] now you just let you have dry for a few
[165 - 170] minutes and of course you have to ensure
[170 - 172] that it was going to stay on your head
[172 - 174] so the best way to do that is to get
[174 - 180] some string or some elastic and thread
[180 - 182] the elastic through for some strange
[182 - 184] reason I cannot find my string and so
[184 - 188] I'm going to use party ribbon and voila
[188 - 191] you have a super awesome personalized
[191 - 195] party hat let me just add my party hat
[195 - 201] onto my head alright here I am what do
[201 - 204] you think I bet you know you will never
[204 - 207] ever buy another party hat because it's
[207 - 210] so simple to make and they look amazing
[210 - 212] talent arts and crafts time is over
[212 - 214] I'm gonna go ahead and say goodbye I
[214 - 215] hope you all have a fabulous day and
[215 - 217] I'll see you all again here next week
[217 - 228] for another edition of back melted and
[228 - 231] then of course you just clean up by
[231 - 234] shoving it all in your desk like this
[234 - 238] and closing it

[8 - 8] hello and welcome back to the insane
[8 - 10] knitters the YouTube video channel this
[10 - 14] is going to be a demonstration of a flat
[14 - 16] hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a
[16 - 19] lot of hats are knit in the round on a
[19 - 21] cable needle and they they're you know
[21 - 23] you just knit them in a circle and then
[23 - 25] you decrease to the top and you finish
[25 - 27] it that way a flat hat is knit on
[27 - 30] straight needles like this with just a
[30 - 33] large piece of fabric and a lot of
[33 - 35] people make hats this way it does
[35 - 37] involve some seaming and I'll show you
[37 - 41] that but what I'm using here is really
[41 - 43] big needles and really thick yarn this
[43 - 47] is called encore mega and on a size 15
[47 - 48] needle it gives you two stitches per
[48 - 51] inch and that's just something I'm using
[51 - 54] right now and I'll tell you why it makes
[54 - 56] a quick it's a very quick knit just
[56 - 59] quick quick turn it up and it it's very
[59 - 61] thick and you only generally need one
[61 - 64] skein to do this you can use two it
[64 - 67] tells you on the label
[67 - 70] how many yards it is and it's this is
[71 - 73] sixty four yards on and I'm using a
[73 - 76] smaller needle than it calls for so I'm
[76 - 77] getting a little more yardage out of
[77 - 80] this to knit with but that's neither
[80 - 81] here nor there you can use any yarn you
[81 - 83] want for this I'm just using the thick
[83 - 85] yarn and the big needles too to show you
[85 - 88] because it's easier um when you want to
[88 - 90] make a flat hat uh
[90 - 93] like I said you is a thick skein of yarn
[93 - 95] to give me about two stitches per inch
[95 - 98] because it's it's a quick knit and I
[98 - 101] find it easier but you can do this with
[101 - 102] baby yarn you can do this with any yarn
[102 - 105] you want as long as you measure properly
[105 - 107] and that is really the thing you want to
[107 - 110] cast on enough stitches on your needles
[110 - 115] to make the length as high as you want
[115 - 118] the hat to be so if you need the Hat to
[118 - 121] be 10 inches high you know so you've got
[121 - 123] good six inches of coverage on your hat
[123 - 126] then you want to cast on enough stitches
[126 - 131] because this is going to be however
[131 - 134] however why it is is going to be how it
[134 - 138] sits on your head so and then you want
[138 - 141] to knit - however you however long you
[141 - 143] want it to be around generally the most
[143 - 146] average hat is the average person's head
[146 - 149] is about 20 to 22 inches you know the
[149 - 151] kids are obviously smaller than that and
[151 - 153] people come in different sizes so you
[153 - 157] just want to knit as long as you want
[157 - 159] your hat to be around and I'll show you
[159 - 163] why what I have done here is I've knit
[163 - 165] to the point to where I want to bind off
[165 - 168] okay I think this is about 12 inches so
[168 - 170] it's going to make a small hat and now
[170 - 172] I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go
[172 - 173] ahead and do that and I'll come back in
[173 - 175] a minute when I'm bound off and I'll
[175 - 177] show you what and we're back
[177 - 179] okay I have bound off this piece of
[179 - 182] fabric to the last stitch and I'll show
[182 - 185] you what to do now
[185 - 188] we've got our last stitch here and you
[188 - 192] want to finish that up no but you want
[193 - 194] it the thing is is we're going to seam
[194 - 196] this now so you want to instead of just
[196 - 198] cutting this off really close and
[198 - 200] binding it off that way you want to
[200 - 205] leave a long piece long piece of tail
[205 - 206] yarn here because we're going to use
[206 - 210] this piece to sew up the Hat so you want
[210 - 213] to leave really long tail to sew with so
[213 - 217] okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much
[217 - 224] okay and then we're gonna cut this
[226 - 226] and then we're gonna pull it through
[226 - 229] okay so there we go that's our last
[229 - 231] stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn
[231 - 234] through and we're gonna there we go now
[234 - 236] we're bound off completely here okay
[236 - 239] there we go now this is the piece of
[239 - 243] fabric that I knitted and what we're
[243 - 246] going to do is we're going to take a
[246 - 250] yarn needle if you don't have a yarn
[250 - 253] needle they come in various kinds this
[253 - 255] is a large one so because I'm using
[255 - 262] really big yarn here this is the piece I
[262 - 265] knitted okay here's the the cast on edge
[265 - 267] this is where I started knitting and
[268 - 270] then I knit it however long I want my
[270 - 273] hat to be generally this one's about 12
[273 - 278] inches and but you know like I said
[278 - 282] normally you'd knit however long two to
[282 - 284] make it or whoever you're knitting it
[284 - 287] for measuring heads is kind of weird but
[287 - 291] you can do it just you know or you can
[291 - 292] take your best guess like I said the
[292 - 295] average hat the average size is about 20
[295 - 299] to 22 inches depending on on the person
[299 - 303] you're knitting for so here's our our
[303 - 305] cast on edge this is where we started
[305 - 307] Inc this is our cast off edge where we
[307 - 309] stop knitting and this is what we're
[309 - 313] going to do we're going to sew the cast
[313 - 314] on edge
[314 - 317] to the cast-off edge the bind off and
[317 - 320] the bind on we're going to sew those
[320 - 321] together and you're going to end up with
[321 - 324] this two looking thing okay like that so
[324 - 327] you want to take your really long tail
[327 - 330] that you left you also can use another
[330 - 334] piece of yarn to do this you know just
[334 - 336] if you want you can use a different size
[336 - 339] of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I
[339 - 341] used to sew the Hat so that way it
[341 - 347] doesn't show if it gets pulled apart
[347 - 348] okay so here we are we have our yarn
[348 - 353] needle and our yarn and we're going to
[353 - 357] sew these edges together now you can see
[357 - 359] here where your yarn where you bound off
[359 - 361] right there and then you can see the
[361 - 364] edge over here so I generally oh and
[364 - 365] then that's another thing to see this
[365 - 366] pattern I just this is garter stitch
[366 - 368] it's just all knit stitches it's nice
[368 - 370] for hats it's thick it's comfortable but
[370 - 372] you can use any pattern you want you
[372 - 374] don't have to be you don't have to use
[374 - 375] garter stitch I know someone who does
[376 - 377] these in ribbing you can do it every
[377 - 381] pattern you want just remember that one
[381 - 383] side will be inside on the person's head
[383 - 385] and the other side will be on the
[385 - 387] outside so just keep that in mind with
[387 - 389] your pattern but this is just simple
[389 - 390] garter stitch it's all it's knit every
[390 - 392] row just because it works for
[392 - 395] demonstration purposes and also it helps
[395 - 399] me line up what I'm doing here so see
[399 - 400] there's I'm lining up the little rows
[400 - 404] there and now you just take your yarn
[404 - 411] needle and you pick up in between the
[411 - 413] bind off stitches there's these little
[413 - 417] ladders see those right in between each
[417 - 420] of these stitches you can go in and pick
[420 - 423] up that little that little ladder inside
[423 - 426] in it and that really helps you a lot
[426 - 428] when you're sewing and so what we're
[428 - 431] going to do is just seam all the way
[431 - 433] across or I'll show you a couple
[433 - 435] stitches how I do it there's lots of
[435 - 438] ways to do this but this is how I do it
[438 - 441] and so I just come over and I pick up
[441 - 446] the corner first just to secure that
[446 - 452] just to secure them together okay so now
[452 - 454] they're there they're secured they're
[454 - 457] sewn together and then I come in and I
[457 - 463] pick up both sides sorry I bump the
[463 - 465] camera pick up both sides of this stitch
[465 - 470] and both sides of this one and pull that
[470 - 474] through there we go that's sewn together
[474 - 476] this making a flat hat does make a big
[476 - 479] seam down the side and that can be
[479 - 480] uncomfortable for some people when they
[480 - 485] wear stuff but it's just a side effect
[485 - 487] of what this pattern you know of making
[487 - 490] a flat hat so and then that's it I just
[490 - 493] go back and forth I cut this is called
[493 - 495] kind of a whip stitch you just go back
[495 - 500] and forth and sew it up all the way up
[500 - 502] up the sides and you want to make sure
[502 - 506] that you get just about every stitch so
[506 - 510] that way you don't have big holes when
[510 - 514] you when the person puts this hat on so
[514 - 517] see I'm picking up both legs of this
[517 - 520] stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm
[520 - 526] just coming through just like this okay
[526 - 528] and you see how that's being seamed
[528 - 531] together there it's making this little
[531 - 535] making this little line down there down
[535 - 537] the Knitting I'll show you what to do
[537 - 546] with that in a minute so there we go
[548 - 548] see that's another reason I like to use
[548 - 551] the same color of yarn because this way
[551 - 557] it doesn't show very very much
[559 - 559] see when you can tell there's a scene
[559 - 561] there but you can't really see where the
[561 - 564] yarn is because I use the same yarn now
[564 - 565] if I used a different color you could
[565 - 569] really see so pick up both legs of that
[569 - 573] stitch and both legs of the next one and
[573 - 576] come come through
[576 - 579] and I will see you in a minute when I
[579 - 581] get this seemed up in Italy
[581 - 583] okay I'm back I've got this all seem
[583 - 586] down the side now okay
[586 - 587] so now I have this tube see this tube
[587 - 590] thing it's a it's like a it's a tube
[590 - 594] okay and it's not a hat yet but it will
[594 - 596] be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last
[596 - 600] stitch here just like that this is a
[600 - 602] little tail where we started to knit
[602 - 605] remember now this is the part where you
[605 - 607] make your hat okay you're going to
[607 - 611] basically stitch up one of the one of
[611 - 615] the sides here and that's going to close
[615 - 618] one end of the tube and kind of make a
[618 - 621] little hat shape like this okay like
[621 - 623] that so it doesn't look like a hat now
[623 - 625] but when I get this all sewn and I pull
[625 - 628] it really tight it'll make a little hat
[628 - 630] like that and you said you know it's not
[630 - 632] the prettiest thing in the world but it
[632 - 634] does work very well and then you can
[634 - 638] fold this up and and you have a hat for
[638 - 642] whomever you're making it for this is
[642 - 646] the part where their head goes in there
[646 - 649] you go you can fold that up and there's
[649 - 651] the top of the hat so that's how you
[651 - 653] make a flat hat so let's go I'll come
[653 - 655] back just a minute when I get this top
[655 - 658] zone and it's over the top you're going
[658 - 660] to instead of going back and forth like
[660 - 663] we did with this loose with the whip
[663 - 665] stitching you're kind of going to do the
[665 - 667] same thing only you do it on both sides
[668 - 670] so there's where I came out so I'm going
[670 - 673] to go in here like that
[673 - 675] pick up that because this is a different
[675 - 677] edge so it's going to look a little a
[677 - 680] little different because this is a side
[680 - 682] now instead of the bind off edge so
[682 - 684] you're going to go so you came out here
[684 - 686] and then you're going to go back on this
[686 - 689] side and over here like that you make in
[689 - 692] kind of a criss cross one two three four
[692 - 693] instead of going back and forth like
[693 - 698] that so you just go just like this and
[698 - 700] I'll see you in just a second when I get
[700 - 701] this done
[701 - 703] okay I've reached the last stitch now
[703 - 705] and these these are all stitched and I
[705 - 706] went back and forth back and forth and
[706 - 708] now I'm at the last stitch I'm going to
[708 - 711] pull it through and you didn't you don't
[711 - 712] want to seen this too tightly because
[712 - 714] this is what you're going to do now now
[714 - 717] you're gonna pull see you pull that
[717 - 719] really tight like that and see how it
[719 - 722] squishes like that okay you pull it
[722 - 723] really tight and then what I do is I
[723 - 727] take my needle and I just kind of wedge
[727 - 731] it through again just just because guess
[731 - 734] that little gives it a little extra
[734 - 738] tightening okay just like that and you
[738 - 740] can do it again if you want just to use
[740 - 743] up some of the slack on your on your
[743 - 745] needle there or some of the extra yarn
[745 - 748] okay there you go and you know one more
[748 - 752] time why not we're here so there you go
[752 - 755] you pull it tight now you weave in your
[755 - 760] ends
[762 - 762] there's an end and then you pull it
[762 - 765] inside out and there you go you have a
[765 - 770] hat here just a flat hat
[775 - 775] tada you made a hat yay Congrats
[775 - 778] here's your flat head with your ins bulb
[778 - 781] in and there's the broom you can roll it
[781 - 782] up or they can just wear it straight
[782 - 785] they want but there it is
[785 - 789] and that's what the top looks like
[790 - 790] like I said it's not the prettiest thing
[790 - 792] in the world but it's good it's
[792 - 793] functional and you can use whatever
[793 - 798] pattern you want and in it however you
[798 - 798] like
[798 - 802] there you go but    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Components (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the line talks about the finished product, decoration of the whole hat, or showing/presenting the hat, label as Hat.
- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[4 - 4] all right okay a nother paper hell - now
[4 - 7] we're going to be making a paper hat and
[7 - 11] do so you will first need to fold the
[11 - 19] paper in half doesn't have to be too
[19 - 25] accurate fold it in half now this bit
[25 - 29] you have to fold over the top half okay
[29 - 34] so that's the middle of the paper you
[34 - 37] can fold it in half gainer sheep just to
[37 - 41] make 9 down the middle that you can see
[41 - 42] okay
[42 - 48] so fold over these top these top pieces
[48 - 56] okay it like you would a paper airplane
[56 - 71] I guess to make this paper hat and it's
[72 - 76] quite a simple thing paper they go what
[76 - 81] more do you need to do opens up how I
[81 - 85] fill it with chips or whatever if you
[85 - 89] want make it look a little neater you
[89 - 101] can fold in these corner pieces and do
[101 - 111] the same on the other side and then
[111 - 116] triangle isn't your style you can then
[116 - 119] fold it down
[119 - 124] and push it in to the little flap there
[124 - 128] and then you have more of a boat shape
[128 - 131] and if you want to make a paper boat
[131 - 134] make a paper boat call it paper boat say
[134 - 136] that's paper foam instead of paper paper
[136 - 142] boat paper paper boat and it also
[142 - 144] doubles up a third thing you put out
[144 - 149] just fold in one of the corners
[149 - 161] I guess corner pieces you fill it with
[161 - 165] water and they have a nice cup which
[165 - 169] will be good for three maybe four uses
[169 - 172] or you can just dry out on a writer if
[173 - 174] you that sort of money and you need
[174 - 178] paper cups all right well that's a nice
[178 - 185] free in one how to paper session there
[185 - 187] you go thank you very much for watching
[187 - 191] please subscribe or leave a like if you
[191 - 194] want okay thank you very much

- If the line describes folding sheets, turning over flaps, or arranging layers, label as Fold/Flap.
- If the line gives measurements or instructions about making cuts, slits, trimming edges, or multi-layer cutting, label as Slit/Cut.
- If the line concerns surface treatments, base layers, towels, tape, cardboard or paint-preparation, label as Surface/Layer.
- When multiple objects are mentioned, choose the one that is the primary object of the instruction or explanation.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[11 - 11] you can use the technique I'm going to
[11 - 15] show you to make a top hat of any size I
[15 - 19] used a cardboard tube but you can use
[19 - 23] construction paper our poster board are
[23 - 26] any material that is stiff enough now I
[26 - 31] started by drawing around the cardboard
[31 - 38] tube at the bottom then I added some
[38 - 44] tabs so that I can glue it onto the two
[44 - 53] after I cut it out it looks like this i
[66 - 66] i glue them on first so later I can
[66 - 71] cover up the tabs takes a few minutes
[71 - 81] sometimes for the glue to dry
[84 - 84] and while we're waiting for that I drew
[84 - 87] around the bottom the same way i placed
[87 - 93] the tube and it's drew a circle around
[93 - 98] it then for the brim I drew a bigger
[98 - 108] circle around that
[111 - 111] and I cut the circle out and in the
[111 - 116] middle I just made a big X I'll show you
[116 - 121] I made a big X like this and I cut on
[121 - 126] those lines so that it looks like that
[126 - 132] did I bending up and the glue goes on
[132 - 140] the inside of these little triangles so
[140 - 143] that you can I mean I'm sorry little bit
[143 - 147] outside because they're going to be
[147 - 153] placed on the inside of the tube put
[153 - 158] those in take your finger and press them
[158 - 164] so that they blew on then the next thing
[164 - 169] idea that I measured this the tube and I
[169 - 172] r is a paper around it to cover it up
[172 - 176] next I cut the little band and it's just
[176 - 178] a little rectangle and you can make it
[178 - 180] as wide or as narrow as you want and
[180 - 184] then I cut strips to make the stripes
[184 - 187] and I put those on before I glued the
[187 - 190] bad don't and i added stars and glitter
[190 - 193] you may not want to but it's up to you
[193 - 195] it sure as you can make it any way you
[195 - 198] want now thanks for watching remember

[21 - 24] step one you get your shiny newspaper as
[24 - 29] so my newspaper is conex East garland
[29 - 32] news how interesting you get a newspaper
[32 - 36] and you fold in her which is pretty easy
[36 - 38] because newspapers for like that enemies
[38 - 41] then the next step is folding the piece
[41 - 44] of paper in half again so it turns out
[44 - 52] like so this is really hard at one hand
[52 - 55] like so then you unfold it again so you
[55 - 57] have a nice line in the middle you fold
[57 - 61] in the corners to that middle line like
[61 - 67] that and like that so it should come
[67 - 71] down like so step 4 should be left at
[71 - 73] these two little flaps at the bottom you
[73 - 76] fold the flaps up over the two triangles
[76 - 84] like that down the other side
[90 - 90] and there you have your paper hat so now
[90 - 92] i'm going to get my sister change to
[92 - 94] mark the hat for you and now this piece
[94 - 98] of crud turns into a divine hash for all
[98 - 103] parties give us a spin on his vine to
[103 - 105] vine and now probably small headed
[105 - 107] people we have the manager version of
[107 - 111] the paper hat give us a spin or which is

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Actions (i.e., Assign each transcript piece to the primary action being described: Plan (scheduling or assigning), Measure (numeric sizes, estimates), Manipulate (folding, turning, punching, threading), or Treat (surface treatment like painting, drying) or Attach (gluing, stapling, sewing, taping).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Plan
Definition: Scheduling, assigning, or describing future intent rather than concrete operations (statements about steps, counts, or what will be done).

[2 - 2] guys today I'm going to be showing you
[2 - 5] how to make a paper hat well I wouldn't
[5 - 9] before watch this video I would say if
[9 - 11] you're going to do this as I as I go
[11 - 13] along you might want to take a bigger
[13 - 17] piece of paper on other than this
[17 - 19] because then I was a little bigger mahat
[19 - 21] if you use this piece of paper it's
[21 - 23] going to make a little kind of thing
[23 - 27] maybe a small hats off and it can get on
[27 - 31] my head my offense man but so let's get
[31 - 39] started so we'll then dude vs. hold the

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hi guys welcome back to origami twist my
[2 - 6] name is Jenna and today's video is one
[6 - 10] that is meant for all of those people
[10 - 13] who have been dealing with snow days and
[13 - 16] born children as a result of the snow
[16 - 19] days now as you probably know I live in
[19 - 21] Australia but I am from the northeastern
[21 - 24] part of the United States and boy oh boy
[24 - 26] have you guys had some weather recently
[26 - 30] whoa Facebook was literally blowing up
[30 - 32] with oh no not another snow day we're
[32 - 34] gonna be going to school in July at this
[34 - 37] rate right oh it's horrible but if
[37 - 40] you've got young children and they're
[40 - 42] stuck inside all day hopefully you got
[42 - 45] up to play in the snow but this
[45 - 47] particular project is great for
[47 - 51] imagination and playing dress-up and
[51 - 53] coming up with stories and ideas and
[53 - 56] basically kicking the kids out of
[56 - 58] boredom and you don't have to be in a
[58 - 62] snow snowy area of the world in order to
[62 - 65] do it it is the classic newspaper paper
[66 - 69] hat so yes you probably already have all
[69 - 70] the materials necessary to make this
[70 - 74] project and say all you need again one
[74 - 77] sheet of newspaper and let's get started
[77 - 82] so I have a what appears to be like a
[82 - 86] half size newspaper and if you've got
[86 - 87] one of those big ones just fold it in
[87 - 88] half and then fold it in half again
[88 - 91] until you have this rectangle about this
[91 - 94] size then the rest of it is really
[94 - 96] really easy you're just gonna fold one
[96 - 100] corner in to make a right triangle there
[101 - 104] you go and you're folding at the middle
[104 - 106] and then you're going to fold the other
[106 - 109] corner in to make another right triangle
[109 - 113] again folding down in the middle so
[113 - 114] you'll have a long skinny strip down
[114 - 118] here and two triangles up top you're
[118 - 120] going to fold this flap up it onto
[120 - 121] itself
[121 - 124] okay let's see how I folded it up onto
[124 - 126] itself to meet the bottom of those
[126 - 130] triangles and then you just fold it up
[130 - 134] again okay now you're going to turn it
[134 - 136] around and do the same thing you're
[136 - 139] gonna fold that bottom flap up so that
[139 - 142] it meets roughly at this point at the
[142 - 145] bottom of the triangle and you should be
[145 - 148] able to tell where that bottom is just
[148 - 150] by looking at the other side so just
[150 - 152] guess it's very rough it doesn't have to
[152 - 154] be perfect and then you're gonna fold
[154 - 158] that rectangle up again so that it
[158 - 161] matches the other side now all that you
[161 - 165] need to do at this stage is open it up
[165 - 169] and as you can see it creates what
[169 - 171] appears to be like a captain's hat
[171 - 173] now I'm sorry I haven't been looking at
[173 - 174] you this whole time I'm trying to see
[174 - 176] myself in the screen I'm not used to
[176 - 177] doing tutorials this way so thank you
[177 - 180] for bearing with me and without further
[180 - 186] ado that's it okay
[186 - 188] now I've got another couple of videos
[188 - 191] that work great with this it's called
[191 - 194] the captain's shirt story it uses this
[194 - 196] as a base and then it turns into a
[196 - 198] really neat interesting story so if
[198 - 200] you're interested in going a bit further
[200 - 202] with this fold let me know in the
[202 - 204] comments below and I'll make videos for
[204 - 208] that so in the comments below yes please
[208 - 211] on the captain's shirt story or whatever
[211 - 213] you know you'd like to put down there
[213 - 215] and thank you so much for watching
[215 - 218] please subscribe if you enjoy paper
[218 - 221] crafting and that sort of thing and I
[221 - 234] hope you guys have a fabulous day bye

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Actions (i.e., Assign each transcript piece to the primary action being described: Plan (scheduling or assigning), Measure (numeric sizes, estimates), Manipulate (folding, turning, punching, threading), or Treat (surface treatment like painting, drying) or Attach (gluing, stapling, sewing, taping).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Plan
Definition: Scheduling, assigning, or describing future intent rather than concrete operations (statements about steps, counts, or what will be done).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: let's get started
	- Context 1: say all you need again one sheet of newspaper and let's get started
	- Content 2: let me know
	- Context 2: if you're interested in going a bit further with this fold let me know in the comments below
```
[S2] Manipulate
Definition: Hands-on physical transformations: folding, cutting, punching, tucking, unfolding, or otherwise physically changing the paper.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fold one corner in to make a right triangle
	- Context 1: then the rest of it is really really easy you're just gonna fold one corner in to make a right triangle
	- Content 2: fold this flap up
	- Context 2: you're going to fold this flap up it onto itself okay let's see how I folded it up onto itself
```
[S3] Measure
Definition: Providing measurements, sizes, counts, or explicit approximations (numeric sizes, relative sizing, or instructions to find the right size).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: about this size
	- Context 1: fold it in half and then fold it in half again until you have this rectangle about this size
	- Content 2: half size newspaper
	- Context 2: so I have a what appears to be like a half size newspaper and if you've got one of those big ones
```
[S4] Attach
Definition: Joining or fastening actions: punching holes, threading cords, tying, stapling, gluing, sewing, or otherwise fastening pieces together.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: use staples
	- Context 1: like like this so it's you put use staples 40-plus people decide to not
```

[2 - 2] hi my name is Leanne I'm the creator
[2 - 4] keeping my toddler entertain which aims
[4 - 6] to provide daily inspiration for keeping
[6 - 7] your toddler entertained using
[7 - 10] inexpensive materials and recycled
[10 - 12] objects from around your home today i
[12 - 13] kept my daughter entertained with a
[13 - 16] piece of newspaper and a toilet roll so
[16 - 20] today we're going to make a paper hat so
[20 - 21] first what we do we need a piece of
[21 - 24] paper you want the open ends towards you
[24 - 28] fold it in half and we're going to do
[28 - 32] some triangle folds sit up quite to the
[33 - 37] center and try and keep it nice and even
[41 - 41] on both sides and then what we're going
[41 - 44] to do with this bottom flap fold it up
[44 - 54] halfway let me going to fold it up again
[60 - 60] make sure it's all muscle then we're
[60 - 62] going to turn it over and repeat the
[62 - 71] process on the other side and there you
[71 - 75] have it a pirate    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] crafts are a wonderful source of
[2 - 4] entertainment for many people which is
[4 - 8] why making paper hats is very important
[8 - 11] to know first follow you need our
[11 - 16] supplies a piece of paper and a
[16 - 21] measuring device step number one you
[21 - 28] must fold the sheet of paper and half
[31 - 31] and measure it to make sure that's it in
[31 - 36] half yeah about right
[38 - 38] step to hold the people's piece of paper
[38 - 46] so that unfolded side is up step 3 both
[46 - 49] this side up like so but you don't want
[49 - 51] to fold it up all the way because you
[51 - 52] want to have some here some of this
[52 - 54] stuff up you want to have like left over
[54 - 60] here yeah then do the same for the other
[60 - 67] side
[76 - 76] step 4 fold well you have these two left
[76 - 80] flaps here fold one of them down out
[80 - 82] like this please like like this like
[82 - 85] that the priests it all the way across
[85 - 86] and make sure you go all the way across
[86 - 88] from increasing otherwise it's not all
[88 - 93] the way across step 6 just save me the
[93 - 101] other side fold it in crease it up oh no
[101 - 105] no it just a little bit off okay measure
[105 - 107] it to make sure that it's about right
[107 - 110] okay it's right anyhow but looks like

[115 - 118] do this that way it's like see no 3d now
[118 - 121] I have I can be a paper hat a persist
[121 - 124] all speed paper boat another option what
[124 - 126] you can do is fold the sides that like
[126 - 128] oh so that way it's like it doesn't go
[128 - 129] in darkness
[129 - 131] then you have lips like this a finished
[131 - 134] paper hat and the last step is wearing
[134 - 136] it

[7 - 7] hi I'm Jenny Jones and I'm an arts and
[7 - 9] crafts expert I'm here today to show you
[9 - 13] how to make a paper hats
[16 - 16] you can use any paper to make your paper
[16 - 18] hat but I would recommend that you use a
[18 - 21] nice big piece of newspaper or a3 paper
[21 - 24] if you want your hat to fit your head
[24 - 26] you're going to need one full sheet of
[26 - 29] newspaper what you need to do to start
[29 - 31] with is take the top of the paper and
[31 - 35] fold it down make a crease and then I
[35 - 37] want you to take your ruler and you need
[37 - 45] to measure half way draw a line
[47 - 47] place your ruler and your pencil to the
[47 - 50] side and then you're going to take the
[50 - 52] top left-hand corner of the newspaper
[52 - 57] and fold it down to that middle center
[57 - 60] line and make a crease now do the same
[60 - 64] for the other side to the middle and
[64 - 69] make a crease okay and then I want you
[69 - 74] to take the top piece of paper and fold
[74 - 83] it up again make a crease across and you
[83 - 89] need to turn the newspaper over now
[89 - 91] depending how much you fold these size
[91 - 93] bits in or determine whether it'll fit
[93 - 96] your head or not so if it's for myself I
[96 - 102] would fold it in about this much and do
[102 - 107] the same for the other side and then
[107 - 109] lastly you need to fold the other side
[109 - 118] of the paper up to match make a crease
[124 - 124] and there you have it you'll paper hat
[124 - 127] this hat would be absolutely perfect for
[127 - 132] a pirate party or even a sailor party
[137 - 137] and that's how to make a paper hat
[137 - 139] you

[18 - 18] okay hi guys today we're going to make a
[18 - 22] Mother's Day hat for you and it's for
[22 - 24] Mother's Day coming up on Sunday we're
[24 - 26] gonna have a little Mother's Day Tea
[26 - 28] Party for Jillian's preschool tomorrow
[28 - 31] so we're doing this in preparation for
[31 - 34] that for all the moms in her preschool
[34 - 37] see so it looks really cute on this is
[37 - 40] the finished product and all the moms
[40 - 42] I'm happy to wear it tomorrow so here we
[42 - 44] go so the things that you're going to
[44 - 48] need is one large piece of butcher paper
[48 - 51] or newsprint will work too and then
[51 - 54] you're going to need two sized bowls one
[54 - 58] larger than the other and so two bowls
[58 - 63] scissors stapler really just stapler and
[63 - 68] some tape okay so let's get started so
[68 - 70] first you start off by forming the Hat
[70 - 72] so you need a mold and that's what the
[72 - 74] bowls are going to do I'm going to put
[74 - 76] the bowl underneath the smaller bowl
[76 - 80] goes underneath the paper okay right in
[80 - 82] the center and then Julian can you help
[82 - 86] switch down the paper a little bit okay
[86 - 89] there you go so then you're going to
[89 - 93] place the larger bowl on top
[97 - 97] put your hand up go ahead and push down
[97 - 103] the bolt and that's the uniform that the
[103 - 106] top with the Hat and you kind of just
[106 - 107] spread off the paper
[107 - 110] give me a lot of folding and cutting
[110 - 115] involved with this and stately okay this
[115 - 118] is just getting the shape of the Hat
[118 - 120] once that's down secure then you can
[120 - 127] lift it up there's the top of the half a
[134 - 134] little Bowl still there okay let's put
[134 - 136] it back we don't want to lose our shape
[136 - 138] here so the next thing I'm going to do
[138 - 140] is to secure the shape we're going to
[140 - 142] use some masking tape okay
[142 - 144] so Jillian why don't you hold down this
[144 - 150] paper you hold the top and we're going
[150 - 153] to start just circling around the Hat
[153 - 160] with the tape kind of press it down as
[160 - 168] you go
[173 - 173] good job Jill and then we're gonna have
[173 - 181] to measure it to see if it fits
[185 - 185] okay it's a little bit big so you can
[185 - 190] take it in by folding it a little bit so
[190 - 191] if it's a little big you can just kind
[191 - 196] of fold it over a little bit what we're
[196 - 200] going to do the rim in a second okay and
[200 - 203] then just use some more tape I like to
[203 - 206] put a second row tape on just to make it
[206 - 215] really secure since the paper is very
[215 - 219] large I'm going to trim the edges so we
[219 - 222] have less paper to work with I'm just
[222 - 224] going to go around and trim it kind of
[224 - 230] in a circle okay so now this is the fun
[230 - 233] part with the kids you'll get to make
[233 - 236] the brim of the Hat just like this so it
[236 - 238] has a little brim all around the sides
[238 - 241] make it finished and look nice so what
[241 - 242] they're going to do is just fold around
[242 - 246] and go all the way around okay go ahead
[246 - 246] Jo
[246 - 254] keep folding it up go and turning it and
[254 - 257] kind of go along after them and press it
[257 - 265] down press it down right there you go
[269 - 269] and then I'm going to go around behind
[269 - 272] her and staple it to secure it and it
[272 - 283] doesn't have to be even lots of muscles
[283 - 287] then there's your undecorated hat ready
[287 - 296] to go let's see okay so we're done with
[296 - 299] the hats the only thing left to do is to
[299 - 301] paint them and make them colorful so
[301 - 302] tomorrow we're going to paint them with
[302 - 305] their preschool class and it should be a
[305 - 308] lot of fun right okay so see you
[308 - 344] tomorrow    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Actions (i.e., Assign each transcript piece to the primary action being described: Plan (scheduling or assigning), Measure (numeric sizes, estimates), Manipulate (folding, turning, punching, threading), or Treat (surface treatment like painting, drying) or Attach (gluing, stapling, sewing, taping).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Plan
Definition: Scheduling, assigning, or stating future intent rather than performing a concrete physical operation.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: today I'm going to show you
	- Context 1: 4 - 9: today I'm going to show you how to make a Indian hat out of construction paper
	- Content 2: first i'm going to
	- Context 2: 6 - 11: with just a few steps first i'm going to show you what materials you need you
```
[S2] Manipulate
Definition: Hands-on physical transformations of the paper: folding, cutting, tucking, unfolding, or otherwise physically changing the paper.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: cut the construction paper
	- Context 1: 22 - 27: clue to get started the first step is to cut the construction paper now you have
	- Content 2: cut into strips
	- Context 2: 33 - 39: you need to see how how much you're going to need so you can just cut into strips this small strips
```
[S3] Measure
Definition: Providing measurements, sizes, counts, or explicit approximations (numeric sizes, relative sizing, or instructions to check fit/size).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: figure out how big your head is
	- Context 1: 27 - 33: now you have to make sure and figure out how big your head is so you need to see how
	- Content 2: we're going to need two of those
	- Context 2: 49 - 65: so because my head is a bit larger than this we're going to need two of those strips so there you are
```
[S4] Attach
Definition: Joining or fastening actions: punching holes, threading, tying, stapling, gluing, or taping pieces together to secure them.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: you're going to staple it
	- Context 1: 68 - 78: the next step to put them two going together you must have your stapler so you're going to staple it on one side
	- Content 2: glue it to be back
	- Context 2: 130 - 142: to take your glue and you're going to glue it to be back and you can add how many friends
```
[S5] Treat
Definition: Surface treatment actions such as painting, decorating, or drying—applying finishes or color to the finished piece.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: paint and your paintbrushes
	- Context 1: 14 - 22: feathers to need your paint and your paintbrushes a stapler scissors and some clue to get started
	- Content 2: green squiggly line
	- Context 2: 100 - 123: I'm just going to do a green squiggly line

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hello and welcome to do the hunting but
[2 - 4] today's video I'll be showing you how to
[4 - 6] make a paper hat
[6 - 10] so these one piece of baseball paper we
[10 - 14] fold it down like so
[17 - 17] like this well then you get the two
[17 - 23] corners I bring them in like this
[23 - 27] because she bit under and then you
[27 - 34] breathe once right up so they debrie the
[34 - 42] other side then put it to the bottom
[42 - 46] then you have a little hat if you like
[46 - 47] paid sit
[47 - 50] stick the cords together so it's not
[50 - 52] like sharp but then you could put it off
[52 - 53] too so you can make this for like a
[53 - 54] kid's party
[54 - 57] so in fact watching please like share
[57 - 59] subscribe    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 7] Winston you want to show everyone how to
[7 - 11] make a nurse hat no you want to play
[11 - 14] with the container camera okay so today
[14 - 15] I'm going to show you how to make a
[15 - 17] really cute little nurse hat I made
[17 - 19] these for my friend's bachelorette party
[19 - 22] and it was super fun and super easy so
[22 - 24] you start off with for you
[24 - 30] square square my square is I don't know
[30 - 33] I just kind of estimated 21 and a half
[33 - 38] centimeters or eight inches or something
[38 - 39] like that
[39 - 41] eight and a half inches it's a square so
[41 - 44] both sides are the same length okay then
[44 - 47] the top of my square I cut two slits
[47 - 50] again I just kind of estimating it's not
[50 - 53] being a very good in the crafter so it's
[53 - 58] like three inches about or seven
[58 - 61] centimeters obviously it's not super
[61 - 62] duper important how big it is because I
[62 - 64] just asked me to indicate myself anyways
[64 - 66] okay so you have your three slits cut
[66 - 69] with scissors you're going to take these
[69 - 72] two you're going to fold them so that
[72 - 79] they match see the edges match nicely
[79 - 85] and I just use tape this is I just made
[85 - 87] it not too hard because I had to make
[87 - 91] like 15 of them or something so that was
[91 - 96] that once it steeps kind of flaxen edge
[96 - 98] hold the edges now I have a shape like
[98 - 102] this lovely pink then you take the top
[102 - 106] part and fold it over the other two
[106 - 110] parts Erin you take your tape and you do
[110 - 114] the same thing tape fix hold on your
[114 - 118] tape a bit now you have a sheet like
[118 - 122] this
[125 - 125] very good I stuff a little flat cross on
[125 - 128] the top then you're going to look at it
[128 - 131] and you have this big thing so I pulled
[131 - 137] it and folded it again so now I know
[137 - 139] exactly how my nurse hat is going to
[139 - 142] look fake it so just so it has those
[142 - 145] things there then I just kind of need
[145 - 150] little folds on the sides of it when you
[150 - 154] put it on your head it's going to sit
[154 - 156] like a little cap so just trying to bend
[156 - 158] the edges a little bit so see how it
[158 - 161] makes kind of a little pact once you
[161 - 163] have your little edges in then you can
[163 - 170] go ahead and fold your thing back up a
[170 - 176] little bit nurse hat so cute these fit
[177 - 178] on our heads really really well and all
[178 - 180] we did was just stick some bobby pins in
[180 - 181] the back
[181 - 183] JooJoo and they stayed in our head
[183 - 185] really really well if you want to go a
[185 - 187] little bit further you can take some of
[187 - 190] this stuff hmm I chose black before a
[190 - 196] bride we had white and I'm super lazy
[196 - 198] and don't have a lot of crafting
[198 - 203] materials I just used regular tape put
[203 - 207] it on my sail material and dock it in
[207 - 211] the back so it would come out of the
[211 - 213] back of our thing and I put a few layers
[213 - 216] that are always anyway so that's how we
[216 - 217] run around the what the bride had a
[217 - 220] black hat and had a white veil and it
[220 - 222] was super funny and cute and easy and
[222 - 224] everyone loves them

[8 - 9] hey guys bill here and today we're going
[9 - 11] to be making paper hats and I've already
[11 - 14] made one if you want to take a look this
[14 - 16] is what it should and look like a themed
[16 - 20] so I'm going to do it step by step so
[20 - 23] you can use any type of paper you want
[23 - 25] wake up use your newspaper for now i
[25 - 28] would first thing you need to do is to
[28 - 33] make sure that it's amble flat on the
[33 - 37] edges especially even and definitely on
[37 - 39] this side you don't it all like bumpy
[39 - 44] and you do the heart so that's how flat
[44 - 46] it should be and then you want to fold
[46 - 49] it in half again so we fold it like this
[49 - 52] you need to fold it so it's perfectly
[52 - 56] not off the edge so I need to do it like
[56 - 59] that now we have to make sure it's
[59 - 64] flutters down like that playgirl press
[64 - 67] and all the rest out and that's the
[67 - 69] second part and now we need to fold it
[69 - 73] back out to get that was just to give us
[73 - 75] 10 tonight page so now we need to fold
[75 - 78] this part of the paper we just go like
[78 - 80] this we need to make sure it's right on
[80 - 83] the middle right on target that make
[83 - 87] sure top right just like that I mean
[87 - 91] lots of the flowers much as we can there
[91 - 94] we go so you have to do it to the crease
[94 - 96] in the middle that's what the creased is
[96 - 98] fought and now we have to do it to this
[98 - 101] side now straight to the middle make
[101 - 104] sure it's connected to my name is it
[104 - 108] flatten it right now now you have to
[108 - 112] fold this part and just the one part so
[112 - 115] you need that bottom part there and then
[115 - 121] you just phone it to where that is there
[121 - 125] then you have to flatten it down make
[125 - 127] sure the triangles stay down so now we
[127 - 131] have to fold this part or so you get the
[131 - 133] side of the half to make sure perfectly
[133 - 138] flat now we do the opposite side exactly
[138 - 142] the same that's why we have the need the
[142 - 146] this side so we go to the other side and
[146 - 151] fold it half here just make sure
[151 - 155] straight there and then fall it again
[155 - 158] and make sure it's in line with the
[158 - 164] other one with that and then you could
[164 - 170] bleep open it up like that and then we
[170 - 175] should have ok perhaps so also if you
[175 - 177] wanted to you could like Curro it in and
[177 - 180] do like like just a quick really so you
[180 - 182] could turn into a pirate hat if you
[182 - 185] wanted to I box score points like that
[185 - 188] so you can stick anything Kahn it really
[188 - 191] committee your own so guys if you
[191 - 193] enjoyed this video and you want any more
[193 - 196] videos like this please we were like I'm
[196 - 199] subscribe and I'll see you next video
[199 - 203] right place    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] today we're going to make hats oh did
[3 - 5] you see I took off my hat
[5 - 6] that's right take off your hat it'll
[6 - 8] take my dog we're gonna make hats out of
[8 - 12] newspaper and for this all you need is
[12 - 14] newspaper so I'll take one of these one
[14 - 16] sheet while you're there so what do we
[16 - 19] read in today no no no we're just not
[19 - 21] reading we're making hats we're making
[21 - 24] hat so all right so normally a newspaper
[24 - 26] is already folded so we can already
[26 - 27] leave that folded right there
[27 - 29] great just like this and we're going to
[29 - 31] take that and we're going to you know
[31 - 33] they say what did they say when when
[33 - 35] you're folding it there's hot dog and
[35 - 37] hamburger is that right so that's ham
[37 - 40] hamburger is a cross you know so you
[40 - 42] have a wider one and then hotdog would
[42 - 44] be the thinner one right yep
[44 - 46] so what we want to do is we want to give
[46 - 49] one fold in half hamburger style number
[49 - 52] seven all right so then we're making a
[52 - 55] crease right down the middle of it it
[55 - 56] doesn't even it doesn't have to be
[56 - 58] perfect that pair of nothing has to be
[58 - 61] right so now we have a nice crease right
[61 - 63] there right in the middle and now we're
[63 - 66] going to make we're going to fold the
[66 - 68] corners the top two corners where the
[68 - 71] fold is you see that there's already
[71 - 72] pulled down we're going to fold those
[72 - 75] corners in at the half
[75 - 78] like right along that crease so there's
[78 - 81] one side you see and then here's the
[81 - 83] other side and we'll both do them on the
[83 - 89] same same side here so now what you have
[89 - 93] should look like this that's what you
[93 - 95] should be seeing and this should be kind
[95 - 97] of open on the bottom right did you have
[97 - 99] a couple scoops oh how you doing there
[99 - 101] Brian I think I'm doing pretty well
[101 - 105] all right good so now the next step is
[105 - 107] that we're going to see yeah the bottom
[107 - 109] edge around here right here and you see
[109 - 111] how you have two sheets it looks like
[111 - 113] you have two sheets of paper there
[113 - 115] together for we're going to fold the
[115 - 118] first sheet of paper up so just one yeah
[118 - 120] and it's kind of like I guess hot dog
[120 - 123] style you're gonna pull it right all the
[123 - 125] way up make it so it looks like this
[125 - 128] right yeah that's right it's a nice
[128 - 130] thick creaser so then so this is what
[130 - 132] that side should look like is that you
[132 - 134] folded right along this
[134 - 138] were those two triangles where those two
[138 - 140] corners came in and you fold it right up
[140 - 143] along here okay so now you're gonna flip
[143 - 147] it over so you see just the back back
[147 - 150] and now this is where we're gonna size
[150 - 152] it now I have a really big head so I'm
[152 - 155] only gonna do small yeah so I'm gonna
[155 - 158] make I'll make a smaller hat for the
[158 - 159] people on the internet because they
[159 - 160] probably don't have as big a head as I
[160 - 162] do and then you're trying to make a big
[162 - 164] hat so they could fit around your food
[164 - 166] around my head so what what we do here
[166 - 170] is we take these sides the whole side
[170 - 172] right here and we fold it in so here's
[172 - 174] one side we're gonna fold this in you
[174 - 177] know we're Emison as much as our much so
[177 - 180] if you have like a smaller head you can
[180 - 183] fold it in like you know a couple three
[183 - 186] inches right there but if you have a
[186 - 188] bigger head like me you can fold it in
[188 - 191] fold it in just a little bit like that
[191 - 193] now do the same on the other side fold
[193 - 198] it up and in like that make a nice
[198 - 200] little crease so now if you're holding
[200 - 202] them because they're gonna try to flap
[202 - 203] out they look like this so this is what
[203 - 207] your back should look like and then just
[207 - 209] like on the front side you're going to
[209 - 212] fold this right up fold this bottom edge
[212 - 215] right up so now it's all and not on the
[215 - 217] same size but on the opposite so on the
[217 - 219] opposite side so now you'll still have
[219 - 221] that little space right in the middle
[221 - 224] and that's a base that your head goes no
[224 - 228] if you start popping it out a little bit
[228 - 230] you're the Apple about it it fits my
[230 - 232] head does it fit your head I got it
[232 - 236] perfect size the one size fits all it's
[236 - 238] supposed to go to the front leg well you
[238 - 239] can do that whichever way you want it to
[239 - 243] be turned that looks really good musics
[243 - 246] great awesome well that's how we make a
[246 - 247] paper right now there are other things
[247 - 250] we can do with this what can we do we
[250 - 252] can put little things in this little in
[252 - 253] the little room in your little brim you
[253 - 255] can have things hanging out and you will
[255 - 260] decorate your hats in fact I'm going to
[260 - 263] add something you have okay I'm gonna
[263 - 266] make it funnier funny hats no no you're
[266 - 271] yo little a nice little I my third
[271 - 273] googly eye there and their way here I
[273 - 275] have another one okay we need to get as
[275 - 277] many eyes as we can right and then
[277 - 280] another googly eye there right now your
[280 - 291] hat has eyes awesome
[302 - 302] alright by the way that is our crafty
[302 - 310] mid cross craft craft

    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Actions (i.e., Assign each transcript piece to the primary action being described: Plan (scheduling or assigning), Measure (numeric sizes, estimates), Manipulate (folding, turning, punching, threading), or Treat (surface treatment like painting, drying) or Attach (gluing, stapling, sewing, taping).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Plan
Definition: Scheduling, assigning, or stating future intent rather than performing a concrete physical operation.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: today we're going to make hats
	- Context 1: today we're going to make hats oh did
	- Content 2: we're going to be making paper hats
	- Context 2: hey guys bill here and today we're going to be making paper hats and I've already
```
[S2] Manipulate
Definition: Hands-on physical transformations of the paper: folding, cutting, tucking, unfolding, or otherwise physically changing the paper.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fold it in half
	- Context 1: so what we want to do is we want to give one fold in half hamburger style
	- Content 2: fold the corners
	- Context 2: now we're going to make we're going to fold the corners the top two corners where the fold is
```
[S3] Measure
Definition: Providing measurements, sizes, counts, or explicit approximations (numeric sizes, relative sizing, or instructions to check fit/size).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: a couple three inches
	- Context 1: if you have like a smaller head you can fold it in like you know a couple three inches right there
	- Content 2: I have a really big head
	- Context 2: and now this is where we're gonna size it now I have a really big head so I'm only gonna do small
```
[S4] Attach
Definition: Joining or fastening actions: punching holes, threading, tying, stapling, gluing, or taping pieces together to secure them.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I just use tape
	- Context 1: see the edges match nicely and I just use tape this is I just made it not too hard because I had to make
	- Content 2: stick some bobby pins in the back
	- Context 2: nurse hat so cute these fit on our heads really really well and all we did was just stick some bobby pins in the back
```
[S5] Treat
Definition: Surface treatment actions such as painting, decorating, or drying—applying finishes or color to the finished piece.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: decorate your hats
	- Context 1: you can have things hanging out and you will decorate your hats in fact I'm going to
	- Content 2: another googly eye
	- Context 2: right now your hat has eyes awesome ... I have another one okay we need to get as many eyes

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[7 - 7] hi my name is Laura I'm an artist and
[7 - 8] I'm going to show you how to make a
[8 - 11] three sided paper hat what you're going
[11 - 14] to need is a sheet of paper I have an
[14 - 16] eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper
[16 - 19] it's going to make a small hat so if you
[19 - 21] want to make a larger hat use a larger
[21 - 22] sheet of paper
[22 - 25] so first the first step is you're gonna
[25 - 29] fold the paper in half lengthwise like
[29 - 33] this after you fold it use your
[33 - 38] fingernail to to make that fold sharper
[38 - 42] and then what you're going to do is make
[42 - 44] sure that the folded side is away from
[44 - 49] you the open edges toward you fold the
[49 - 52] upper right and left hand corners in
[52 - 53] toward each other so that they meet in
[53 - 56] the middle and then do a sort of
[56 - 60] temporary temporary fold and then again
[60 - 62] sharpen that with your fingernail on
[62 - 68] both sides and you'll have flaps left
[68 - 70] facing towards you what you're going to
[70 - 76] do is fold one side up on one side
[76 - 79] fingernail it down and then flip it over
[79 - 83] and take that other flap up on the other
[83 - 90] side and then you have one two three
[90 - 95] corners on your hat and you can put it
[95 - 99] on your head like that I am Laura thank
[99 - 101] you for watching how to make a three
[101 - 105] sided paper hat    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

```
- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hey everybody this is gonna be a
[2 - 5] tutorial on how to make a paper hat so
[5 - 7] the first step is you want to draw three
[7 - 10] shapes that look like this now the first
[10 - 13] shape you draw is gonna have a curve
[13 - 16] right there and then the second one is
[16 - 19] gonna be a little bit less curved but a
[19 - 21] slant going up there but a small slit
[21 - 23] and then the third is going to be the
[23 - 25] smallest piece and the less curved on
[25 - 27] the edge once you have this drawing out
[27 - 28] what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut
[28 - 31] each one out after you cut them out
[31 - 32] you're gonna have three of these and
[32 - 35] you're gonna take one of them put them
[35 - 37] on a white piece of paper and trace
[37 - 39] around because what you're doing is
[39 - 41] you're you're making two of each shape
[41 - 43] and so you're making sure that each one
[43 - 45] is the same size as the one before
[45 - 47] because if it's not the hats not gonna
[47 - 54] fit together correctly and once you have
[54 - 56] all those traced what you're gonna do is
[56 - 58] take some scissors and you're gonna cut
[58 - 63] each one out this is the time to color
[63 - 66] them and if you want to once you have
[66 - 67] them all cut out what you're gonna do is
[67 - 69] you're gonna take one of them and you're
[69 - 71] gonna draw lines like this around the
[71 - 73] edge these represent the seams of the
[73 - 76] Hat and if you want to you can also do a
[76 - 79] dotted line for these instead but you
[79 - 82] can do it however you want and you're
[82 - 88] gonna do that for every single one
[90 - 90] make sure that for these pieces the two
[90 - 92] largest ones the slant is going down on
[92 - 94] that side and going up on that one it's
[94 - 98] almost like a mirror image once you have
[98 - 100] them all drawn on what you're gonna do
[100 - 103] is you're gonna take these to make sure
[103 - 105] it's those two take a piece of tape tape
[105 - 107] on the back and then you're gonna put
[107 - 109] together you are now starting to put the
[109 - 115] Hat together take another piece of tape
[115 - 117] and put it on the back and put them
[117 - 119] together you're gonna be doing this for
[119 - 122] each one just make sure that you don't
[122 - 124] tape too close to the top because when
[124 - 126] you're done sometimes it doesn't fit
[126 - 129] together quite right so you want to make
[129 - 130] sure you have enough room if you need to
[130 - 133] adjust now the next two pieces is you
[133 - 136] want to put ones of the smallest ones on
[136 - 138] one side and the other smallest piece on
[138 - 141] the other side each side has to be
[141 - 142] symmetrical because if you don't put
[142 - 144] them in to get together in the right
[144 - 145] order the hats not going to come out
[145 - 147] right so you have to make sure you're
[147 - 151] doing it in this order and then take
[151 - 154] that other small piece and attach it to
[154 - 173] the other side like that
[175 - 175] now for the two largest pieces which are
[175 - 176] the two lost you have to be careful
[176 - 179] about this make sure that the slants on
[179 - 181] this are going kind of in the mirror
[181 - 184] image again going opposite but then
[184 - 185] after that you just do what you've been
[185 - 187] doing the whole time taping on the back
[187 - 191] and then putting together like this just
[191 - 193] like that just make sure that the slants
[193 - 201] are going the opposite direction
[204 - 204] these two last pieces are usually the
[204 - 206] most difficult to put together because
[206 - 207] everything is a little bit crowded
[207 - 210] because it's making the circular shape
[210 - 214] so it may be a little bit difficult in
[214 - 216] the video you can tell that I'm gonna
[216 - 219] have a little bit of trouble with it but
[219 - 221] it seemed pretty easy to work around but
[221 - 225] just keep taping to the back and then
[225 - 231] putting it together like that and if you
[231 - 233] have a gap at the top that's completely
[233 - 235] fine or if you have a little bit of tape
[235 - 241] left over there don't worry about it and
[241 - 243] if you do have any extra tape up there
[243 - 245] what you can do is just take some
[245 - 247] scissors and cut off the extra tape and
[247 - 248] don't worry about that gap at the top
[248 - 252] because that's gonna be covered up later
[252 - 254] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[254 - 256] take some cardboard make sure it's thin
[256 - 257] cardboard you can use anything you want
[257 - 259] as you can see here I use some Ritz
[259 - 262] cardboard so you can do anything you
[262 - 269] really want make about six tabs like
[269 - 272] that you you actually really only need
[272 - 277] four but um I'm just doing that in case
[277 - 279] I mess out so then take some tape you
[279 - 281] can bend it too it might make it easier
[281 - 283] and then put it in like that and just
[283 - 287] keep taping around the entire hat this
[287 - 288] is to make the Hat more sturdy and it
[288 - 292] also gives the Hat the round shape so
[292 - 294] that if you wear it it won't crumble or
[294 - 297] anything when you put it on and so just
[297 - 299] keep taping around the top and bottom
[299 - 300] make sure they're on there correctly
[300 - 303] make sure they won't fall off and you
[303 - 305] may notice you can see through the white
[305 - 307] hat to the cardboard but that's fine if
[307 - 309] you have your head actually colored in
[309 - 311] right now you um you probably can't even
[311 - 315] see it so it's fine now what you're
[315 - 317] gonna do is you're gonna make the brim
[317 - 319] for that so put the Hat down like that
[319 - 322] and you're gonna make kind of a half
[322 - 328] circle like this yeah and kind of draw
[328 - 331] it in lightly in case you mess up so you
[331 - 333] can erase it and there won't be any left
[333 - 334] over
[334 - 338] marks and once you have it right or how
[338 - 341] you like it just go around and darken it
[341 - 345] back in like that and then put the hat
[346 - 348] back on and you're just gonna make a
[348 - 351] half circle around the edges like this
[351 - 357] and by now which it look like a half
[357 - 361] moon and then just darken it in and then
[361 - 364] once you have it all darken in you're
[364 - 367] gonna cut it out with some scissors and
[367 - 370] this is when you can color the Birman if
[370 - 373] you want to now what we're gonna do is
[373 - 376] you're gonna take some pencil and you're
[376 - 378] gonna draw some lines like this these
[378 - 383] represent the seams of the brim so just
[383 - 389] draw it around like that you can also do
[389 - 392] these dotted lines here instead if you
[392 - 395] want but you can do it any way and just
[395 - 398] keep doing that but before you get to
[398 - 401] the very end about this point stop and
[401 - 406] just leave that area blank in there now
[406 - 407] you're gonna take some cardboard and
[407 - 412] you're gonna trace around the paper it's
[412 - 414] okay if the cardboard is a little bit
[414 - 417] too small as you can see here I have him
[417 - 418] used a little bit too small a piece but
[418 - 420] it's fine just make sure it's not too
[420 - 422] small and then you're gonna cut it out
[422 - 425] because this is gonna make the brim more
[425 - 428] stiff
[430 - 430] and then you're gonna take some glue
[430 - 433] glue the cardboard and then you're just
[433 - 437] gonna put the brim the paper broom onto
[437 - 443] the cardboard
[446 - 446] once you're done with that you can flip
[446 - 449] it over and if you have any writing like
[449 - 453] here and writing like that what you do
[453 - 457] is you trace around and then you cut
[457 - 459] that out and then you're just gonna put
[459 - 460] it over the words or whatever there is
[460 - 462] there so you don't see it and then put
[462 - 464] it down like that and if you can still
[464 - 466] see through you just do it again
[466 - 469] and then you won't be able to see it now
[469 - 470] what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[470 - 473] make sure that shape is the same shape
[473 - 475] you see on the Hat it has to be that
[475 - 478] shape because that's the front tape the
[478 - 487] brim put a few pieces on and tape it to
[487 - 490] the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on
[490 - 499] straight
[502 - 502] now you're gonna fill that gap in so
[502 - 505] take some paper cut out a square
[505 - 511] rectangular shape and you're gonna glue
[511 - 520] the inside of the Hat like this
[523 - 523] and then Pat that down inside and then
[523 - 533] you can't see through anymore like that
[536 - 536] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[536 - 538] make the airholes for that so take some
[538 - 541] paper and draw six circles and put dark
[541 - 545] dots in the middle of each one and then
[545 - 552] cut them out
[554 - 554] once you have them all cut out take some
[554 - 557] glue glue the bottom of them and paste
[557 - 574] them on in these areas on the Hat
[577 - 577] now we're gonna make the very top of the
[577 - 581] Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a
[581 - 584] strip about this big I actually think I
[584 - 587] made it a little bit too long take some
[587 - 590] glue glue the end and make a circle
[590 - 593] shape about this size and glue both ends
[593 - 600] together once you have that done take a
[600 - 602] piece of paper cut out a circle about
[602 - 609] this big take the other piece glue the
[609 - 614] bottom put that on top and then once you
[614 - 619] get that on glue the other side you
[619 - 620] might want to use a little bit more glue
[620 - 622] than I did here and then put that on the
[622 - 627] top right there now this is the point
[627 - 630] when you can put logos on here here here
[630 - 633] I used EC and a bunch of them but you
[633 - 635] can do anything you want and also you
[635 - 637] can go online print this sticker off
[637 - 641] glue the back and put it on the brim to
[641 - 644] give it a more realistic look and there
[644 - 647] you go there's your hat if you have any
[647 - 649] questions you can message me and I'll
[649 - 652] answer anything if you want you can also
[652 - 654] put your video of your hat as a video
[654 - 657] response to this I'd love to see it good
[657 - 659] luck    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 10] your Christmas cracker for this you're
[10 - 13] going to use some tissue paper a ruler a
[13 - 17] pencil some glue and some scissors I'm
[17 - 20] using a twenty by thirty inch piece of
[20 - 23] paper and I'm going to fold it into four
[23 - 26] making four hats let's speed this up a
[26 - 29] bit
[32 - 32] my head is 24 inches so that's the
[32 - 34] measurement I'm going to use for my hats
[34 - 38] my head's quite big so now we're going
[38 - 41] to measure 24 inches along the paper and
[41 - 45] then cut just over that so now we're
[45 - 47] going to fold it into three and then
[47 - 49] we're going to cut off the top and the
[49 - 52] bottom so that there we have four
[52 - 58] separate hats
[61 - 61] now we're going to cut a triangle in the
[61 - 74] top followed by half a triangle
[76 - 76] now we're going to glue the two sides
[76 - 84] together
[90 - 90] thank you for watching and if you'd like

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hey you volunteered solo shot and today
[2 - 2] I'm going to show you guys how to make
[2 - 8] paper hats
[11 - 11] this is a very simple tutorial but I
[11 - 13] promise it will be very useful because
[13 - 15] it saved me from boredom multiple times
[15 - 17] and you will thank you for it later
[17 - 19] alright so the only material that you
[19 - 21] can need for this tutorial is one piece
[21 - 25] of paper and so first you're going to
[25 - 28] place your paper down with a landscape
[28 - 30] orientation and then you're going to
[30 - 36] fold it in half vertically then you're
[36 - 38] going to take the top corners and fold
[38 - 41] them into the senton and make sure that
[41 - 47] they are touching
[49 - 49] and after that you're going to fold up
[49 - 51] the little bottom part that it holds
[51 - 54] over top of the corners that you just
[54 - 55] fold it in and you're going to do that
[55 - 62] on both sides
[64 - 64] then all you have to do is just open it
[64 - 66] up from the bottom and bam there you
[66 - 71] have it making paper hats are great way
[71 - 72] to pass the time when you're bored and
[72 - 76] they also make very stylish head hope
[76 - 78] you enjoyed the tutorial and thanks for
[78 - 81] watching

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Actions (i.e., Assign each transcript piece to the primary action being described: Plan (scheduling or assigning), Measure (numeric sizes, estimates), Manipulate (folding, turning, punching, threading), or Treat (surface treatment like painting, drying) or Attach (gluing, stapling, sewing, taping).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Plan
Definition: Scheduling, assigning, or stating future intent rather than performing a concrete physical operation.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I'm going to show you guys how to make
	- Context 1: hey you volunteered solo shot and today I'm going to show you guys how to make paper hats
	- Content 2: you're going to

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] all right so today I gotta make it this
[2 - 7] mini seven head and is very simple so
[7 - 10] we're gonna get any size of paper that
[10 - 11] you'd like it to
[11 - 15] I'm a rectangular and I decided to use
[15 - 19] this palm-sized getting a hand sized up
[19 - 22] paper so now the first thing you do is
[22 - 27] fold it into half like this increase it
[27 - 32] well next you're gonna fold into half
[32 - 38] again now you're gonna make it into four
[38 - 40] segments so you're gonna fight it but
[40 - 43] not a half and the other side waiting
[43 - 49] like this
[51 - 51] you sure you've got four segments now
[51 - 53] and what you're gonna do
[53 - 57] is that you're going to UM open it up
[57 - 67] and flip into half monkey this
[70 - 70] Kalish you've got eight segments now so
[70 - 73] you're gonna foot down
[73 - 77] one two three down and then you're gonna
[77 - 87] fold it up the half like this
[90 - 90] okay so now you've got to just write
[90 - 119] showy very simple okay
[129 - 129] no no sir for the rest of the four sites
[129 - 134] okay so I do the same for here like
[134 - 137] right after you're done so you're gonna
[137 - 141] fold inwards like a dish I thought all

[268 - 271] very simple on you good luck and thanks
[271 - 273] for watching goodbye    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[48 - 51] the paper hat into a big to sell across
[51 - 56] water this is very simple you really
[56 - 61] need an a4 piece of paper and a pen to

[84 - 94] your a full kind of paper in half so it
[94 - 99] looks like this then this is the corner
[99 - 102] that is folded yes to fold it into the
[102 - 106] middle like smash then you take the
[106 - 109] other side and do exactly the same thing

[114 - 117] just get one of them and put them up
[117 - 120] like that then you turn the whole thing
[120 - 123] round and do the same with the other
[123 - 127] piece again
[130 - 130] and there you have it your paper hat now

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are discovering segment labels for temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Actions (i.e., Assign each transcript piece to the primary action being described: Plan (scheduling or assigning), Measure (numeric sizes, estimates), Manipulate (folding, turning, punching, threading), or Treat (surface treatment like painting, drying) or Attach (gluing, stapling, sewing, taping).).

### INPUTS
- Existing segment labels:
[S1] Plan
Definition: Scheduling, assigning, or stating future intent rather than performing a concrete physical operation.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I'm going to show you
	- Context 1: today I'm going to show you how to make
	- Content 2: if you want to
	- Context 2: if you want to make a doll hat like this one then you
```
[S2] Manipulate
Definition: Hands-on physical transformations of the paper: folding, cutting, tucking, unfolding, or otherwise physically changing the paper.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: fold it into half
	- Context 1: your paper hat is that you have to fold your a full kind of paper in half so it
	- Content 2: turn the whole thing round
	- Context 2: just get one of them and put them up like that then you turn the whole thing round and do the same
```
[S3] Measure
Definition: Providing measurements, sizes, counts, or explicit approximations (numeric sizes, relative sizing, or instructions to check fit/size).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: a4 piece of paper
	- Context 1: you really need an a4 piece of paper and a pen to do some decorating now
	- Content 2: will give you a hat about this size
	- Context 2: an April piece of paper will give you a hat about this size for your teddy bear
```
[S4] Attach
Definition: Joining or fastening actions: punching holes, threading, tying, stapling, gluing, or taping pieces together to secure them.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: glue the two sides together
	- Context 1: now we're going to glue the two sides together
	- Content 2: some glue
	- Context 2: you're going to use some tissue paper a ruler a pencil some glue and some scissors
```
[S5] Treat
Definition: Surface treatment actions such as painting, decorating, or drying—applying finishes or color to the finished piece.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: do some decorating
	- Context 1: you really need an a4 piece of paper and a pen to do some decorating
	- Content 2: draw some flowers
	- Context 2: I want to listen decoration to it so I'm just going to draw some flowers the

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] I'm going to show you how to make this
[3 - 6] fun bowlers hat for Saint Patrick's Day
[6 - 8] or any other occasion for which you
[8 - 10] would need a bowlers hat the first thing
[10 - 11] you're going to need is your newspaper
[11 - 14] base that's done with one that has a
[14 - 17] deep Bowl for the Hat put it out on the
[18 - 20] table you get it as flat as you can
[20 - 23] around the edges and once you have that
[23 - 25] done you're simply going to start
[25 - 29] rolling the edges up and just gonna roll
[29 - 33] all the way around because you're kind
[33 - 36] of preparing this newspaper to be your
[36 - 39] bowlers hat once you've gone around the
[39 - 44] first time go ahead and start taping it
[44 - 47] all the way around you might have to
[47 - 49] take fairly often but you might not it
[49 - 52] depends on your newspaper once you've
[52 - 53] gotten your hat to the point where you
[53 - 57] taped it all up you can look at it and
[57 - 61] see if it's in as close as you want and
[61 - 65] has that bowler hat look to it once you
[65 - 68] have done that you're going to want to
[68 - 71] take tempera paint or any other paint I
[71 - 73] took this tempered paint put it in a big
[73 - 76] paper plate and use the large brush to
[76 - 79] paint the whole hat newspaper is very
[79 - 81] thin paper and it takes a long time to
[81 - 83] dry so you want to make sure your hat is
[83 - 85] completely dry before you start
[85 - 87] decorating it but in the meantime you
[87 - 89] can cut out what you're going to use to
[89 - 94] make your decorations I use simply three
[94 - 96] hearts that I cut out of construction
[96 - 101] paper and I made them the same size so I
[101 - 105] use the first one as a template cut the
[105 - 116] second one and cut the third one
[122 - 122] and for these I covered them with
[122 - 126] Elmer's glue and then I sprinkled green
[126 - 131] glitter on them and let it dry and once
[131 - 135] that was done I put them together three
[135 - 137] hearts with a little dab of glue I'll
[137 - 138] put a little piece of tape that'll give
[138 - 143] you the idea and my shamrock was ready
[143 - 146] to go from my bowlers hat then once my
[146 - 149] hat was dry I started making that other
[149 - 152] decorations for it no there's your
[152 - 154] shamrock to go in the middle of your hat
[154 - 159] I used shamrock confetti and I used
[159 - 163] glitter glue and I just made some
[163 - 165] decorations around the brim of the Hat
[165 - 169] took my Elmer's glue and put on the
[169 - 171] confetti and glued the shamrock to the
[171 - 173] middle with a little piece of confetti
[173 - 175] now you can of course make a bowlers hat
[175 - 178] any color for any occasion but this is
[178 - 183] how I made a st. Patrick's Day bowler
[183 - 187] hat out of newspaper    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats this very
[8 - 10] fun party hat is made out of only three
[10 - 13] pieces of construction paper this is the
[13 - 15] smaller paper the first thing you want
[15 - 21] to do is take the smaller paper and just
[21 - 26] wrap it around your head until it fits
[26 - 32] and tape or staple it nothing to it
[32 - 37] really once you have your hat secured
[37 - 39] might want to take a special pair of
[39 - 42] scissors but the fancy edges and cut
[42 - 44] around the edge so that you have an edge
[44 - 47] that looks like this and you know if you
[47 - 49] don't have the fancy scissors to do this
[49 - 51] kind of an edge you can always just tear
[51 - 54] the paper and that too will give you a
[54 - 57] fancy edge now one thing that you can do
[57 - 60] too before you even cut out your hat
[60 - 63] before you staple it is to leave it open
[63 - 66] and decorate it you might want to write
[66 - 70] happy birthday and crayon or use markers
[70 - 73] or even use glitter and glue once you've
[73 - 75] done that you put your hat together and
[75 - 78] then you want to make this this is the
[78 - 82] fun stuff and it's so easy to make cut
[82 - 84] out a variety of sizes and colors of
[84 - 87] circles and then just start cutting out
[87 - 89] your circle you want to stay fairly
[89 - 92] close to the edge but it does not have
[92 - 95] to be even that's the beauty of it and
[95 - 97] you just keep cutting until you keep
[97 - 101] Spile spiraling around and you have it
[101 - 103] looking like this and then you take the
[103 - 109] center and stretch it as you can see I
[109 - 111] used several pieces of yellow and
[111 - 114] several pieces of purple I started out
[114 - 116] with a large circle with the purple and
[116 - 119] this was a small circle with the yellow
[119 - 122] put them all together staple them at the
[122 - 128] top shook them out and here we go a
[128 - 131] really fun crazy
[131 - 134] happy birthday hat it would work for new
[134 - 136] to

[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats are Dan
[8 - 11] welcome to Pirates Cove mateys we're
[11 - 13] going to make a very simple pirate hat
[13 - 17] out of a newspaper you know went three
[17 - 19] sheets of newspaper you can use two but
[19 - 22] three sheets gives you a more sturdy hat
[22 - 25] that are two-sided all the way no half
[25 - 27] sheets lay it out in front of you
[27 - 31] sideways with your fold at the front and
[31 - 34] you're going to find the middle and then
[34 - 39] fold it down to the middle not quite
[39 - 43] centered up and down again leaving a
[43 - 45] little bit of space at the top so that
[45 - 48] it's even and then you're simply going
[48 - 52] to take the first three sheets one two
[52 - 64] three and fold them up and crease it
[66 - 66] [Applause]
[66 - 70] turn it over fold up the next three
[70 - 75] sheets and then fasten it I put mine on
[75 - 79] my head and then stapled it right at the
[79 - 81] sides of my head so that it would stay
[81 - 85] on my head and fit you can do that with
[85 - 90] your hat too now you have your base for
[90 - 95] your pirate hat and what I did with mine
[95 - 100] was to use black construction paper to
[100 - 102] cover the front of it but you could also
[102 - 104] use black tempera paint and I stuck it
[104 - 107] down in the Hat band and then I made a
[107 - 110] skull and crossbones and glued it on
[110 - 112] you're going to make a skull and
[112 - 115] crossbones basically you want to make
[115 - 124] kind of a light bulb shape and put the
[124 - 127] two circles for the eyes you're going to
[127 - 130] have your teeth come down again kind of
[130 - 135] to a point and have teeth and your nose
[135 - 145] make them black make your bones
[154 - 154] cut them out glue them on and voila you
[154 - 159] have a pirate's hat pretty simple huh    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[21 - 21] decorate your mash a pirate ship using
[21 - 23] acrylic paint you can have lots of fun
[23 - 25] coming up with a really piratey color
[25 - 32] scheme
[36 - 36] the next step is to fold your card in
[36 - 39] half this is going to create the larger
[39 - 42] waves to go around the outside of your
[42 - 45] hat fold it in half and then we're going
[45 - 60] to draw the wave shape along the paper
[63 - 63] this time to make the smaller waves fold
[63 - 66] your paper in half along the long side
[66 - 78] of the paper and then fold it again
[81 - 81] so you'll find this is slightly more
[81 - 83] difficult to cut through because there's
[83 - 87] four layers of card to cut through so
[87 - 88] you may have to be a bit tougher with
[88 - 92] your scissors but it's well worth it
[92 - 94] because the effect is fantastic at the
[94 - 97] end cut the leaves down the center along
[97 - 106] the fold
[108 - 108] if you have a little extra on the bottom
[108 - 110] you could always just sand that off
[110 - 113] using your glue gun run a line of glue
[113 - 119] along the bottom of your boat and then
[119 - 124] securely attaches to the Hat you'll need
[124 - 125] to hold this in place for a few minutes
[125 - 129] just so it sticks securely so it doesn't
[129 - 130] matter if it's completely straight
[130 - 132] because waves are choppy so it just adds
[132 - 135] to the sea effect next we're going to
[135 - 137] attach the waves to the Hat I'm going to
[137 - 139] use a glue gun but you could use a
[139 - 143] stapler Sini's stick lots of glue onto
[143 - 148] your waves and mold it to the shape of
[148 - 153] the Hat holding it firmly you might need
[153 - 156] to cut your waves to size so it fits
[156 - 163] around the Hat it doesn't matter if it
[163 - 165] overlaps a little bit because the other
[165 - 166] waves are going to go around the edge
[166 - 169] next we're going to attach our smaller
[169 - 174] waves around the edge of the Hat we're
[174 - 175] going to use exactly the same processes
[175 - 180] the larger waves gluing just over the
[180 - 185] top to give this layered effect you will
[185 - 187] need an adult's help with the glue gun
[187 - 189] because it does get very hot I'm going
[189 - 195] to add some treasure to my bonnet you
[195 - 196] can put it wherever you fancy so it
[196 - 199] could be around the boat or it could be
[199 - 200] at the bottom of the ocean it's
[200 - 204] completely up to you and firmly place
[204 - 208] the coins onto the Hat
[208 - 210] if you have any overlapping sections in
[210 - 212] your waves you could always put one of
[212 - 217] the coins over the top so when you stuck
[217 - 218] on your coins
[218 - 221] it obviously adds some sparkle to your
[221 - 228] hat we're going to add the bunting so
[228 - 230] you can attach this however you like you
[230 - 231] could use as little or as much as you
[231 - 233] like so I'm going to attach it the top
[233 - 238] just with a little blob of glue and you
[238 - 241] can cut off any excess just adds the
[241 - 260] finishing touches to your pirate ship

[30 - 32] station a place for on how to's and the
[32 - 33] airwaves
[33 - 35] well a must-have accessory in a girl's
[35 - 40] wardrobe is hat and especially with the
[40 - 43] summer starting in a few once a hat is a
[43 - 46] must-have and in today's video i'm going
[46 - 48] to show you how i made this hat using
[48 - 50] just paper that's it
[50 - 53] we need only paper to make this lovely
[53 - 55] hat so if you want to see how to make
[55 - 57] this then please keep watching the video
[57 - 59] to make the Hat take a balloon and blow
[59 - 62] it so that it resembles the size of your
[62 - 65] head then place it in a container and
[65 - 67] add some sellotape so that it doesn't
[67 - 71] move then take a mixture of 3/4 part of
[71 - 73] glue and 1/4 part of water and apply a
[73 - 75] layer of newspaper on half of the
[75 - 80] balloon
[103 - 103] [Music]
[103 - 107] when you're done keep this to dry let it
[107 - 111] dry completely once try apply a second
[111 - 113] layer of newspaper and then leave that
[113 - 116] to dry as well
[120 - 120] and when the second layer of newspaper
[120 - 123] dries pop the balloon so that you get
[123 - 127] this dome-like shape now take a chart
[127 - 129] paper and place the dome on it in the
[129 - 133] center and Mark points then take a plate
[133 - 135] and draw a circle connecting these
[135 - 139] points then draw a smaller circle inside
[139 - 142] the circle and then a bigger on the
[142 - 146] outside
[149 - 149] so now we have one small one medium and
[149 - 151] one big circle out of which the medium
[151 - 154] one is exactly the size of the dome now
[154 - 162] cut out the circle
[173 - 173] [Music]
[173 - 177] then from the inside circle cut slits to
[177 - 180] the middle circle
[188 - 188] now fold the paper like so
[188 - 195] [Music]
[198 - 198] so take the gnome and cut slits on that
[198 - 204] as well and fold them outwards
[222 - 222] the apply glue on these little portions
[222 - 225] and then place the chart paper on it and
[225 - 232] stick it well
[234 - 234] [Music]
[234 - 237] then apply glue on these little portions
[237 - 239] of the chart paper and stick it on the
[239 - 243] dome
[250 - 250] [Music]
[250 - 253] once that is done leave it to dry
[253 - 258] overnight so that the dome hardens then
[258 - 260] paint it with your favourite colour I
[260 - 262] chose this bright yellow color
[262 - 265] make sure to paint the side as well as
[265 - 268] even this will be showing then apply
[268 - 272] glue on the edges of the dome
[286 - 286] tie a bow on one side and that's it your
[286 - 291] hat is ready so that was my DIY paper
[291 - 293] hat I hope you all enjoyed watching the

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] in this clip I'm going to show you how
[2 - 5] to make a paper top hat you're gonna
[5 - 8] take a piece of paper a paper plate here
[8 - 10] you can take your scissors and you're
[10 - 12] going to cut out the middle by carefully
[12 - 15] poking the scissors through the top and
[15 - 19] cutting leaving a little bit of the
[19 - 23] paper plate on the top and notice that I
[23 - 26] turned the paper plate over or upside
[26 - 31] down I quickly cut that out all the way
[31 - 34] around and then I'm going to take just a
[34 - 37] regular piece of construction paper and
[37 - 39] I'm going to fold down the top just a
[39 - 42] little bit to give it some sturdy nuts
[42 - 46] because I want it to really hold
[46 - 48] together well I'm gonna put a glue stick
[48 - 53] on here pull that down and then I'm
[53 - 56] going to also fold up the bottom about a
[56 - 58] half of an inch and this is going to
[58 - 65] allow the paper top-hat to fit inside of
[65 - 66] the paper plate and I'm going to cut
[66 - 69] little slits around here which will help
[69 - 75] mold it into a circle okay the last
[75 - 76] thing I want to do is I want to overlap
[76 - 78] these so I'm going to put a little bit
[78 - 80] of glue here and I'm going to go ahead
[80 - 87] and put these two together like that and
[87 - 91] there take a piece of tape and put this
[91 - 93] right in the middle where I'm
[93 - 96] overlapping it just to support it a
[96 - 98] little bit now I'm going to put this
[98 - 102] right inside of my paper plate and I'm
[102 - 104] going to turn it upside down and I'm
[104 - 108] going to start gluing these tabs onto
[108 - 112] the paper plate just like you see here
[112 - 115] and I'm going to go ahead and show you
[115 - 118] that this last one and I want to support
[118 - 122] it again with a piece of tape and the
[122 - 125] very last thing I'm going to do is I'm
[125 - 128] going to take my magic marker and I'm
[128 - 130] going to go ahead and make that brim
[130 - 135] black and you have a great top hat

[6 - 8] bonnet with your child using simple
[8 - 12] paper mache techniques first of all you
[12 - 15] need a balloon if you're making
[15 - 17] something like this out of an egg shape
[17 - 20] or if you want to make an animal or a
[20 - 23] bird you'll need a small balloon for the
[23 - 26] head and a larger balloon for the body
[26 - 33] so first of all you need to inflate the
[33 - 36] large balloon sit it in a saucepan or
[36 - 40] bowl so it sits securely while you're
[40 - 44] applying the strips of newspaper I've
[44 - 48] cut mine into 1 by 5 inch strips but you
[48 - 50] don't have to be approximate that's only
[50 - 52] approximate you don't have to do it
[52 - 55] exactly the other thing you'll need is a
[55 - 58] pot of PVA glue which has some water in
[58 - 60] so it's running and you'll need a
[60 - 63] paintbrush and your meal apron that will
[63 - 65] cover your child because it can get
[65 - 69] messy so what I recommend is that you
[69 - 71] get your child to cover an area of the
[71 - 75] balloon with glue and I'll show you that
[75 - 79] it should just run on the balloon quite
[79 - 82] easily and then when you've covered an
[82 - 86] area the balloon in PVA close then apply
[86 - 89] strips running in the same direction all
[89 - 95] around the balloon then apply another
[95 - 98] another layer of glue put on the strip's
[98 - 101] going in the opposite direction
[101 - 103] overlapping slightly so there are no
[103 - 107] gaps and then your third layer will go
[108 - 110] back to the original direction and then
[110 - 112] I recommend that for the final layer you
[112 - 116] apply some kitchen towel strips or some
[116 - 118] paper to have strips and because this
[119 - 122] provides a really good base for
[122 - 126] painting it helps it make sure that the
[126 - 128] print doesn't show through or it
[128 - 130] provides a good base if you're wanting
[130 - 135] to put squares of tissue paper onto the
[135 - 139] balloon so after about 24 hours in a
[139 - 142] really warm place your balloon will
[142 - 146] hopefully dry so that it's it's it's
[146 - 154] very solid pop the balloon and cut up a
[154 - 157] circular hole in the bottom large enough
[157 - 161] for the top of the Hat it should should
[161 - 164] fit securely on and then if you're
[164 - 166] wanting to make an Easter basket like
[166 - 169] this all you have to do is is cut a
[169 - 173] section out of each side leaving a
[173 - 175] handle shape down the middle and then
[175 - 177] your child could fill it with things
[177 - 180] that they've made here I've got homemade
[180 - 184] daffodils and decoupage eggs and some
[184 - 187] tissue paper shred or if you're
[187 - 191] interested in making one of the animals
[191 - 197] then your your need and some tissue
[197 - 200] paper shred for their for their fur or
[200 - 204] for their coat now to help you to sit
[204 - 206] the head on top of the body what I
[206 - 209] recommend is that you have used some
[209 - 211] duct tape to make some crisscross shapes
[211 - 214] at the bottom of the head and stick that
[214 - 216] on top of the body so that it's secure
[216 - 218] because what you don't want is for the
[218 - 221] kids to fall off during the Easter
[221 - 228] bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you
[228 - 230] there were three kits available there's
[230 - 233] a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and
[233 - 235] there's a lamb kit and
[236 - 238] come with all materials that you'll need
[238 - 241] to make an Easter bonnet as well as the
[241 - 244] bonnet and a list of instructions to
[244 - 246] help you go through it step by step but
[246 - 248] if you have any questions or any ideas
[248 - 250] that you want to discuss please get in
[250 - 254] touch thank you for watching    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[66 - 68] further ado let's make a party hat to
[68 - 69] make this project you're gonna need a
[69 - 70] piece of paper
[70 - 72] I chose bread so much is my Percy pretty
[72 - 77] dress and scissors tape glue and
[77 - 79] something to decorate your party hat
[79 - 81] with first you're gonna need to make a
[81 - 84] complete square out of your construction
[84 - 87] paper then you're gonna make your hat
[87 - 89] all you have to do is roll your piece of
[89 - 91] paper into a cone now to do that you
[91 - 96] just roll your paper you're going to
[96 - 101] tape it ever notice how that first piece
[101 - 105] of tape just never feels right now
[105 - 109] you're gonna cut it this paper off I'm
[109 - 111] not the best hat maker and I'm just
[111 - 114] winging it cuz once you have your cowan
[114 - 123] you decorate it
[125 - 125] now I suggest using stickers as well
[125 - 127] especially letter stickers and if you
[127 - 130] were having a birthday party and there
[130 - 131] were a bunch of different kids you could
[131 - 133] put their names on them which is kind of
[133 - 136] cool and certain stickers will add your
[136 - 139] own unique flair to your hat I think
[139 - 140] this is great for birthday parties and
[140 - 142] if I ever have kids it's totally
[142 - 144] something I would do it has some of
[144 - 147] these steampunk ears that I'm going to
[147 - 150] put on my hat okay cool
[150 - 157] Naomi I'm all about being cool
[159 - 159] and now I'm going to put my name on it
[159 - 160] you know so what the other partygoers
[161 - 163] know who I am awesome
[163 - 165] now you just let you have dry for a few
[165 - 170] minutes and of course you have to ensure
[170 - 172] that it was going to stay on your head
[172 - 174] so the best way to do that is to get
[174 - 180] some string or some elastic and thread
[180 - 182] the elastic through for some strange
[182 - 184] reason I cannot find my string and so
[184 - 188] I'm going to use party ribbon and voila
[188 - 191] you have a super awesome personalized
[191 - 195] party hat let me just add my party hat
[195 - 201] onto my head alright here I am what do
[201 - 204] you think I bet you know you will never
[204 - 207] ever buy another party hat because it's
[207 - 210] so simple to make and they look amazing
[210 - 212] talent arts and crafts time is over
[212 - 214] I'm gonna go ahead and say goodbye I
[214 - 215] hope you all have a fabulous day and
[215 - 217] I'll see you all again here next week
[217 - 228] for another edition of back melted and
[228 - 231] then of course you just clean up by
[231 - 234] shoving it all in your desk like this
[234 - 238] and closing it    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[8 - 8] hello and welcome back to the insane
[8 - 10] knitters the YouTube video channel this
[10 - 14] is going to be a demonstration of a flat
[14 - 16] hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a
[16 - 19] lot of hats are knit in the round on a
[19 - 21] cable needle and they they're you know
[21 - 23] you just knit them in a circle and then
[23 - 25] you decrease to the top and you finish
[25 - 27] it that way a flat hat is knit on
[27 - 30] straight needles like this with just a
[30 - 33] large piece of fabric and a lot of
[33 - 35] people make hats this way it does
[35 - 37] involve some seaming and I'll show you
[37 - 41] that but what I'm using here is really
[41 - 43] big needles and really thick yarn this
[43 - 47] is called encore mega and on a size 15
[47 - 48] needle it gives you two stitches per
[48 - 51] inch and that's just something I'm using
[51 - 54] right now and I'll tell you why it makes
[54 - 56] a quick it's a very quick knit just
[56 - 59] quick quick turn it up and it it's very
[59 - 61] thick and you only generally need one
[61 - 64] skein to do this you can use two it
[64 - 67] tells you on the label
[67 - 70] how many yards it is and it's this is
[71 - 73] sixty four yards on and I'm using a
[73 - 76] smaller needle than it calls for so I'm
[76 - 77] getting a little more yardage out of
[77 - 80] this to knit with but that's neither
[80 - 81] here nor there you can use any yarn you
[81 - 83] want for this I'm just using the thick
[83 - 85] yarn and the big needles too to show you
[85 - 88] because it's easier um when you want to
[88 - 90] make a flat hat uh
[90 - 93] like I said you is a thick skein of yarn
[93 - 95] to give me about two stitches per inch
[95 - 98] because it's it's a quick knit and I
[98 - 101] find it easier but you can do this with
[101 - 102] baby yarn you can do this with any yarn
[102 - 105] you want as long as you measure properly
[105 - 107] and that is really the thing you want to
[107 - 110] cast on enough stitches on your needles
[110 - 115] to make the length as high as you want
[115 - 118] the hat to be so if you need the Hat to
[118 - 121] be 10 inches high you know so you've got
[121 - 123] good six inches of coverage on your hat
[123 - 126] then you want to cast on enough stitches
[126 - 131] because this is going to be however
[131 - 134] however why it is is going to be how it
[134 - 138] sits on your head so and then you want
[138 - 141] to knit - however you however long you
[141 - 143] want it to be around generally the most
[143 - 146] average hat is the average person's head
[146 - 149] is about 20 to 22 inches you know the
[149 - 151] kids are obviously smaller than that and
[151 - 153] people come in different sizes so you
[153 - 157] just want to knit as long as you want
[157 - 159] your hat to be around and I'll show you
[159 - 163] why what I have done here is I've knit
[163 - 165] to the point to where I want to bind off
[165 - 168] okay I think this is about 12 inches so
[168 - 170] it's going to make a small hat and now
[170 - 172] I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go
[172 - 173] ahead and do that and I'll come back in
[173 - 175] a minute when I'm bound off and I'll
[175 - 177] show you what and we're back
[177 - 179] okay I have bound off this piece of
[179 - 182] fabric to the last stitch and I'll show
[182 - 185] you what to do now
[185 - 188] we've got our last stitch here and you
[188 - 192] want to finish that up no but you want
[193 - 194] it the thing is is we're going to seam
[194 - 196] this now so you want to instead of just
[196 - 198] cutting this off really close and
[198 - 200] binding it off that way you want to
[200 - 205] leave a long piece long piece of tail
[205 - 206] yarn here because we're going to use
[206 - 210] this piece to sew up the Hat so you want
[210 - 213] to leave really long tail to sew with so
[213 - 217] okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much
[217 - 224] okay and then we're gonna cut this
[226 - 226] and then we're gonna pull it through
[226 - 229] okay so there we go that's our last
[229 - 231] stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn
[231 - 234] through and we're gonna there we go now
[234 - 236] we're bound off completely here okay
[236 - 239] there we go now this is the piece of
[239 - 243] fabric that I knitted and what we're
[243 - 246] going to do is we're going to take a
[246 - 250] yarn needle if you don't have a yarn
[250 - 253] needle they come in various kinds this
[253 - 255] is a large one so because I'm using
[255 - 262] really big yarn here this is the piece I
[262 - 265] knitted okay here's the the cast on edge
[265 - 267] this is where I started knitting and
[268 - 270] then I knit it however long I want my
[270 - 273] hat to be generally this one's about 12
[273 - 278] inches and but you know like I said
[278 - 282] normally you'd knit however long two to
[282 - 284] make it or whoever you're knitting it
[284 - 287] for measuring heads is kind of weird but
[287 - 291] you can do it just you know or you can
[291 - 292] take your best guess like I said the
[292 - 295] average hat the average size is about 20
[295 - 299] to 22 inches depending on on the person
[299 - 303] you're knitting for so here's our our
[303 - 305] cast on edge this is where we started
[305 - 307] Inc this is our cast off edge where we
[307 - 309] stop knitting and this is what we're
[309 - 313] going to do we're going to sew the cast
[313 - 314] on edge
[314 - 317] to the cast-off edge the bind off and
[317 - 320] the bind on we're going to sew those
[320 - 321] together and you're going to end up with
[321 - 324] this two looking thing okay like that so
[324 - 327] you want to take your really long tail
[327 - 330] that you left you also can use another
[330 - 334] piece of yarn to do this you know just
[334 - 336] if you want you can use a different size
[336 - 339] of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I
[339 - 341] used to sew the Hat so that way it
[341 - 347] doesn't show if it gets pulled apart
[347 - 348] okay so here we are we have our yarn
[348 - 353] needle and our yarn and we're going to
[353 - 357] sew these edges together now you can see
[357 - 359] here where your yarn where you bound off
[359 - 361] right there and then you can see the
[361 - 364] edge over here so I generally oh and
[364 - 365] then that's another thing to see this
[365 - 366] pattern I just this is garter stitch
[366 - 368] it's just all knit stitches it's nice
[368 - 370] for hats it's thick it's comfortable but
[370 - 372] you can use any pattern you want you
[372 - 374] don't have to be you don't have to use
[374 - 375] garter stitch I know someone who does
[376 - 377] these in ribbing you can do it every
[377 - 381] pattern you want just remember that one
[381 - 383] side will be inside on the person's head
[383 - 385] and the other side will be on the
[385 - 387] outside so just keep that in mind with
[387 - 389] your pattern but this is just simple
[389 - 390] garter stitch it's all it's knit every
[390 - 392] row just because it works for
[392 - 395] demonstration purposes and also it helps
[395 - 399] me line up what I'm doing here so see
[399 - 400] there's I'm lining up the little rows
[400 - 404] there and now you just take your yarn
[404 - 411] needle and you pick up in between the
[411 - 413] bind off stitches there's these little
[413 - 417] ladders see those right in between each
[417 - 420] of these stitches you can go in and pick
[420 - 423] up that little that little ladder inside
[423 - 426] in it and that really helps you a lot
[426 - 428] when you're sewing and so what we're
[428 - 431] going to do is just seam all the way
[431 - 433] across or I'll show you a couple
[433 - 435] stitches how I do it there's lots of
[435 - 438] ways to do this but this is how I do it
[438 - 441] and so I just come over and I pick up
[441 - 446] the corner first just to secure that
[446 - 452] just to secure them together okay so now
[452 - 454] they're there they're secured they're
[454 - 457] sewn together and then I come in and I
[457 - 463] pick up both sides sorry I bump the
[463 - 465] camera pick up both sides of this stitch
[465 - 470] and both sides of this one and pull that
[470 - 474] through there we go that's sewn together
[474 - 476] this making a flat hat does make a big
[476 - 479] seam down the side and that can be
[479 - 480] uncomfortable for some people when they
[480 - 485] wear stuff but it's just a side effect
[485 - 487] of what this pattern you know of making
[487 - 490] a flat hat so and then that's it I just
[490 - 493] go back and forth I cut this is called
[493 - 495] kind of a whip stitch you just go back
[495 - 500] and forth and sew it up all the way up
[500 - 502] up the sides and you want to make sure
[502 - 506] that you get just about every stitch so
[506 - 510] that way you don't have big holes when
[510 - 514] you when the person puts this hat on so
[514 - 517] see I'm picking up both legs of this
[517 - 520] stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm
[520 - 526] just coming through just like this okay
[526 - 528] and you see how that's being seamed
[528 - 531] together there it's making this little
[531 - 535] making this little line down there down
[535 - 537] the Knitting I'll show you what to do
[537 - 546] with that in a minute so there we go
[548 - 548] see that's another reason I like to use
[548 - 551] the same color of yarn because this way
[551 - 557] it doesn't show very very much
[559 - 559] see when you can tell there's a scene
[559 - 561] there but you can't really see where the
[561 - 564] yarn is because I use the same yarn now
[564 - 565] if I used a different color you could
[565 - 569] really see so pick up both legs of that
[569 - 573] stitch and both legs of the next one and
[573 - 576] come come through
[576 - 579] and I will see you in a minute when I
[579 - 581] get this seemed up in Italy
[581 - 583] okay I'm back I've got this all seem
[583 - 586] down the side now okay
[586 - 587] so now I have this tube see this tube
[587 - 590] thing it's a it's like a it's a tube
[590 - 594] okay and it's not a hat yet but it will
[594 - 596] be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last
[596 - 600] stitch here just like that this is a
[600 - 602] little tail where we started to knit
[602 - 605] remember now this is the part where you
[605 - 607] make your hat okay you're going to
[607 - 611] basically stitch up one of the one of
[611 - 615] the sides here and that's going to close
[615 - 618] one end of the tube and kind of make a
[618 - 621] little hat shape like this okay like
[621 - 623] that so it doesn't look like a hat now
[623 - 625] but when I get this all sewn and I pull
[625 - 628] it really tight it'll make a little hat
[628 - 630] like that and you said you know it's not
[630 - 632] the prettiest thing in the world but it
[632 - 634] does work very well and then you can
[634 - 638] fold this up and and you have a hat for
[638 - 642] whomever you're making it for this is
[642 - 646] the part where their head goes in there
[646 - 649] you go you can fold that up and there's
[649 - 651] the top of the hat so that's how you
[651 - 653] make a flat hat so let's go I'll come
[653 - 655] back just a minute when I get this top
[655 - 658] zone and it's over the top you're going
[658 - 660] to instead of going back and forth like
[660 - 663] we did with this loose with the whip
[663 - 665] stitching you're kind of going to do the
[665 - 667] same thing only you do it on both sides
[668 - 670] so there's where I came out so I'm going
[670 - 673] to go in here like that
[673 - 675] pick up that because this is a different
[675 - 677] edge so it's going to look a little a
[677 - 680] little different because this is a side
[680 - 682] now instead of the bind off edge so
[682 - 684] you're going to go so you came out here
[684 - 686] and then you're going to go back on this
[686 - 689] side and over here like that you make in
[689 - 692] kind of a criss cross one two three four
[692 - 693] instead of going back and forth like
[693 - 698] that so you just go just like this and
[698 - 700] I'll see you in just a second when I get
[700 - 701] this done
[701 - 703] okay I've reached the last stitch now
[703 - 705] and these these are all stitched and I
[705 - 706] went back and forth back and forth and
[706 - 708] now I'm at the last stitch I'm going to
[708 - 711] pull it through and you didn't you don't
[711 - 712] want to seen this too tightly because
[712 - 714] this is what you're going to do now now
[714 - 717] you're gonna pull see you pull that
[717 - 719] really tight like that and see how it
[719 - 722] squishes like that okay you pull it
[722 - 723] really tight and then what I do is I
[723 - 727] take my needle and I just kind of wedge
[727 - 731] it through again just just because guess
[731 - 734] that little gives it a little extra
[734 - 738] tightening okay just like that and you
[738 - 740] can do it again if you want just to use
[740 - 743] up some of the slack on your on your
[743 - 745] needle there or some of the extra yarn
[745 - 748] okay there you go and you know one more
[748 - 752] time why not we're here so there you go
[752 - 755] you pull it tight now you weave in your
[755 - 760] ends
[762 - 762] there's an end and then you pull it
[762 - 765] inside out and there you go you have a
[765 - 770] hat here just a flat hat
[775 - 775] tada you made a hat yay Congrats
[775 - 778] here's your flat head with your ins bulb
[778 - 781] in and there's the broom you can roll it
[781 - 782] up or they can just wear it straight
[782 - 785] they want but there it is
[785 - 789] and that's what the top looks like
[790 - 790] like I said it's not the prettiest thing
[790 - 792] in the world but it's good it's
[792 - 793] functional and you can use whatever
[793 - 798] pattern you want and in it however you
[798 - 798] like
[798 - 802] there you go but    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[4 - 4] all right okay a nother paper hell - now
[4 - 7] we're going to be making a paper hat and
[7 - 11] do so you will first need to fold the
[11 - 19] paper in half doesn't have to be too
[19 - 25] accurate fold it in half now this bit
[25 - 29] you have to fold over the top half okay
[29 - 34] so that's the middle of the paper you
[34 - 37] can fold it in half gainer sheep just to
[37 - 41] make 9 down the middle that you can see
[41 - 42] okay
[42 - 48] so fold over these top these top pieces
[48 - 56] okay it like you would a paper airplane
[56 - 71] I guess to make this paper hat and it's
[72 - 76] quite a simple thing paper they go what
[76 - 81] more do you need to do opens up how I
[81 - 85] fill it with chips or whatever if you
[85 - 89] want make it look a little neater you
[89 - 101] can fold in these corner pieces and do
[101 - 111] the same on the other side and then
[111 - 116] triangle isn't your style you can then
[116 - 119] fold it down
[119 - 124] and push it in to the little flap there
[124 - 128] and then you have more of a boat shape
[128 - 131] and if you want to make a paper boat
[131 - 134] make a paper boat call it paper boat say
[134 - 136] that's paper foam instead of paper paper
[136 - 142] boat paper paper boat and it also
[142 - 144] doubles up a third thing you put out
[144 - 149] just fold in one of the corners
[149 - 161] I guess corner pieces you fill it with
[161 - 165] water and they have a nice cup which
[165 - 169] will be good for three maybe four uses
[169 - 172] or you can just dry out on a writer if
[173 - 174] you that sort of money and you need
[174 - 178] paper cups all right well that's a nice
[178 - 185] free in one how to paper session there
[185 - 187] you go thank you very much for watching
[187 - 191] please subscribe or leave a like if you
[191 - 194] want okay thank you very much

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[11 - 11] you can use the technique I'm going to
[11 - 15] show you to make a top hat of any size I
[15 - 19] used a cardboard tube but you can use
[19 - 23] construction paper our poster board are
[23 - 26] any material that is stiff enough now I
[26 - 31] started by drawing around the cardboard
[31 - 38] tube at the bottom then I added some
[38 - 44] tabs so that I can glue it onto the two
[44 - 53] after I cut it out it looks like this i
[66 - 66] i glue them on first so later I can
[66 - 71] cover up the tabs takes a few minutes
[71 - 81] sometimes for the glue to dry
[84 - 84] and while we're waiting for that I drew
[84 - 87] around the bottom the same way i placed
[87 - 93] the tube and it's drew a circle around
[93 - 98] it then for the brim I drew a bigger
[98 - 108] circle around that
[111 - 111] and I cut the circle out and in the
[111 - 116] middle I just made a big X I'll show you
[116 - 121] I made a big X like this and I cut on
[121 - 126] those lines so that it looks like that
[126 - 132] did I bending up and the glue goes on
[132 - 140] the inside of these little triangles so
[140 - 143] that you can I mean I'm sorry little bit
[143 - 147] outside because they're going to be
[147 - 153] placed on the inside of the tube put
[153 - 158] those in take your finger and press them
[158 - 164] so that they blew on then the next thing
[164 - 169] idea that I measured this the tube and I
[169 - 172] r is a paper around it to cover it up
[172 - 176] next I cut the little band and it's just
[176 - 178] a little rectangle and you can make it
[178 - 180] as wide or as narrow as you want and
[180 - 184] then I cut strips to make the stripes
[184 - 187] and I put those on before I glued the
[187 - 190] bad don't and i added stars and glitter
[190 - 193] you may not want to but it's up to you
[193 - 195] it sure as you can make it any way you
[195 - 198] want now thanks for watching remember

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Actions (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as Plan when the speaker states future intent, assigns tasks, or schedules actions (non-action-oriented planning).
- Label as Measure when the speaker provides measurements, sizes, or explicit approximations (numbers, 'about', inches/cm).
- Label as Manipulate when the speaker gives hands-on physical instructions (fold, flip, tuck, punch).
- Label as Treat when the content is about surface treatment (paint, brush, drying, base layers).
- Label as Attach when the content is about joining methods or fastening (glue, sew, staple, tape).
- If multiple verbs are present, choose the verb that represents the primary instructional intent of the utterance.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hi guys welcome back to origami twist my
[2 - 6] name is Jenna and today's video is one
[6 - 10] that is meant for all of those people
[10 - 13] who have been dealing with snow days and
[13 - 16] born children as a result of the snow
[16 - 19] days now as you probably know I live in
[19 - 21] Australia but I am from the northeastern
[21 - 24] part of the United States and boy oh boy
[24 - 26] have you guys had some weather recently
[26 - 30] whoa Facebook was literally blowing up
[30 - 32] with oh no not another snow day we're
[32 - 34] gonna be going to school in July at this
[34 - 37] rate right oh it's horrible but if
[37 - 40] you've got young children and they're
[40 - 42] stuck inside all day hopefully you got
[42 - 45] up to play in the snow but this
[45 - 47] particular project is great for
[47 - 51] imagination and playing dress-up and
[51 - 53] coming up with stories and ideas and
[53 - 56] basically kicking the kids out of
[56 - 58] boredom and you don't have to be in a
[58 - 62] snow snowy area of the world in order to
[62 - 65] do it it is the classic newspaper paper
[66 - 69] hat so yes you probably already have all
[69 - 70] the materials necessary to make this
[70 - 74] project and say all you need again one
[74 - 77] sheet of newspaper and let's get started
[77 - 82] so I have a what appears to be like a
[82 - 86] half size newspaper and if you've got
[86 - 87] one of those big ones just fold it in
[87 - 88] half and then fold it in half again
[88 - 91] until you have this rectangle about this
[91 - 94] size then the rest of it is really
[94 - 96] really easy you're just gonna fold one
[96 - 100] corner in to make a right triangle there
[101 - 104] you go and you're folding at the middle
[104 - 106] and then you're going to fold the other
[106 - 109] corner in to make another right triangle
[109 - 113] again folding down in the middle so
[113 - 114] you'll have a long skinny strip down
[114 - 118] here and two triangles up top you're
[118 - 120] going to fold this flap up it onto
[120 - 121] itself
[121 - 124] okay let's see how I folded it up onto
[124 - 126] itself to meet the bottom of those
[126 - 130] triangles and then you just fold it up
[130 - 134] again okay now you're going to turn it
[134 - 136] around and do the same thing you're
[136 - 139] gonna fold that bottom flap up so that
[139 - 142] it meets roughly at this point at the
[142 - 145] bottom of the triangle and you should be
[145 - 148] able to tell where that bottom is just
[148 - 150] by looking at the other side so just
[150 - 152] guess it's very rough it doesn't have to
[152 - 154] be perfect and then you're gonna fold
[154 - 158] that rectangle up again so that it
[158 - 161] matches the other side now all that you
[161 - 165] need to do at this stage is open it up
[165 - 169] and as you can see it creates what
[169 - 171] appears to be like a captain's hat
[171 - 173] now I'm sorry I haven't been looking at
[173 - 174] you this whole time I'm trying to see
[174 - 176] myself in the screen I'm not used to
[176 - 177] doing tutorials this way so thank you
[177 - 180] for bearing with me and without further
[180 - 186] ado that's it okay
[186 - 188] now I've got another couple of videos
[188 - 191] that work great with this it's called
[191 - 194] the captain's shirt story it uses this
[194 - 196] as a base and then it turns into a
[196 - 198] really neat interesting story so if
[198 - 200] you're interested in going a bit further
[200 - 202] with this fold let me know in the
[202 - 204] comments below and I'll make videos for
[204 - 208] that so in the comments below yes please
[208 - 211] on the captain's shirt story or whatever
[211 - 213] you know you'd like to put down there
[213 - 215] and thank you so much for watching
[215 - 218] please subscribe if you enjoy paper
[218 - 221] crafting and that sort of thing and I
[221 - 234] hope you guys have a fabulous day bye

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[18 - 18] okay hi guys today we're going to make a
[18 - 22] Mother's Day hat for you and it's for
[22 - 24] Mother's Day coming up on Sunday we're
[24 - 26] gonna have a little Mother's Day Tea
[26 - 28] Party for Jillian's preschool tomorrow
[28 - 31] so we're doing this in preparation for
[31 - 34] that for all the moms in her preschool
[34 - 37] see so it looks really cute on this is
[37 - 40] the finished product and all the moms
[40 - 42] I'm happy to wear it tomorrow so here we
[42 - 44] go so the things that you're going to
[44 - 48] need is one large piece of butcher paper
[48 - 51] or newsprint will work too and then
[51 - 54] you're going to need two sized bowls one
[54 - 58] larger than the other and so two bowls
[58 - 63] scissors stapler really just stapler and
[63 - 68] some tape okay so let's get started so
[68 - 70] first you start off by forming the Hat
[70 - 72] so you need a mold and that's what the
[72 - 74] bowls are going to do I'm going to put
[74 - 76] the bowl underneath the smaller bowl
[76 - 80] goes underneath the paper okay right in
[80 - 82] the center and then Julian can you help
[82 - 86] switch down the paper a little bit okay
[86 - 89] there you go so then you're going to
[89 - 93] place the larger bowl on top
[97 - 97] put your hand up go ahead and push down
[97 - 103] the bolt and that's the uniform that the
[103 - 106] top with the Hat and you kind of just
[106 - 107] spread off the paper
[107 - 110] give me a lot of folding and cutting
[110 - 115] involved with this and stately okay this
[115 - 118] is just getting the shape of the Hat
[118 - 120] once that's down secure then you can
[120 - 127] lift it up there's the top of the half a
[134 - 134] little Bowl still there okay let's put
[134 - 136] it back we don't want to lose our shape
[136 - 138] here so the next thing I'm going to do
[138 - 140] is to secure the shape we're going to
[140 - 142] use some masking tape okay
[142 - 144] so Jillian why don't you hold down this
[144 - 150] paper you hold the top and we're going
[150 - 153] to start just circling around the Hat
[153 - 160] with the tape kind of press it down as
[160 - 168] you go
[173 - 173] good job Jill and then we're gonna have
[173 - 181] to measure it to see if it fits
[185 - 185] okay it's a little bit big so you can
[185 - 190] take it in by folding it a little bit so
[190 - 191] if it's a little big you can just kind
[191 - 196] of fold it over a little bit what we're
[196 - 200] going to do the rim in a second okay and
[200 - 203] then just use some more tape I like to
[203 - 206] put a second row tape on just to make it
[206 - 215] really secure since the paper is very
[215 - 219] large I'm going to trim the edges so we
[219 - 222] have less paper to work with I'm just
[222 - 224] going to go around and trim it kind of
[224 - 230] in a circle okay so now this is the fun
[230 - 233] part with the kids you'll get to make
[233 - 236] the brim of the Hat just like this so it
[236 - 238] has a little brim all around the sides
[238 - 241] make it finished and look nice so what
[241 - 242] they're going to do is just fold around
[242 - 246] and go all the way around okay go ahead
[246 - 246] Jo
[246 - 254] keep folding it up go and turning it and
[254 - 257] kind of go along after them and press it
[257 - 265] down press it down right there you go
[269 - 269] and then I'm going to go around behind
[269 - 272] her and staple it to secure it and it
[272 - 283] doesn't have to be even lots of muscles
[283 - 287] then there's your undecorated hat ready
[287 - 296] to go let's see okay so we're done with
[296 - 299] the hats the only thing left to do is to
[299 - 301] paint them and make them colorful so
[301 - 302] tomorrow we're going to paint them with
[302 - 305] their preschool class and it should be a
[305 - 308] lot of fun right okay so see you
[308 - 344] tomorrow    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 7] Winston you want to show everyone how to
[7 - 11] make a nurse hat no you want to play
[11 - 14] with the container camera okay so today
[14 - 15] I'm going to show you how to make a
[15 - 17] really cute little nurse hat I made
[17 - 19] these for my friend's bachelorette party
[19 - 22] and it was super fun and super easy so
[22 - 24] you start off with for you
[24 - 30] square square my square is I don't know
[30 - 33] I just kind of estimated 21 and a half
[33 - 38] centimeters or eight inches or something
[38 - 39] like that
[39 - 41] eight and a half inches it's a square so
[41 - 44] both sides are the same length okay then
[44 - 47] the top of my square I cut two slits
[47 - 50] again I just kind of estimating it's not
[50 - 53] being a very good in the crafter so it's
[53 - 58] like three inches about or seven
[58 - 61] centimeters obviously it's not super
[61 - 62] duper important how big it is because I
[62 - 64] just asked me to indicate myself anyways
[64 - 66] okay so you have your three slits cut
[66 - 69] with scissors you're going to take these
[69 - 72] two you're going to fold them so that
[72 - 79] they match see the edges match nicely
[79 - 85] and I just use tape this is I just made
[85 - 87] it not too hard because I had to make
[87 - 91] like 15 of them or something so that was
[91 - 96] that once it steeps kind of flaxen edge
[96 - 98] hold the edges now I have a shape like
[98 - 102] this lovely pink then you take the top
[102 - 106] part and fold it over the other two
[106 - 110] parts Erin you take your tape and you do
[110 - 114] the same thing tape fix hold on your
[114 - 118] tape a bit now you have a sheet like
[118 - 122] this
[125 - 125] very good I stuff a little flat cross on
[125 - 128] the top then you're going to look at it
[128 - 131] and you have this big thing so I pulled
[131 - 137] it and folded it again so now I know
[137 - 139] exactly how my nurse hat is going to
[139 - 142] look fake it so just so it has those
[142 - 145] things there then I just kind of need
[145 - 150] little folds on the sides of it when you
[150 - 154] put it on your head it's going to sit
[154 - 156] like a little cap so just trying to bend
[156 - 158] the edges a little bit so see how it
[158 - 161] makes kind of a little pact once you
[161 - 163] have your little edges in then you can
[163 - 170] go ahead and fold your thing back up a
[170 - 176] little bit nurse hat so cute these fit
[177 - 178] on our heads really really well and all
[178 - 180] we did was just stick some bobby pins in
[180 - 181] the back
[181 - 183] JooJoo and they stayed in our head
[183 - 185] really really well if you want to go a
[185 - 187] little bit further you can take some of
[187 - 190] this stuff hmm I chose black before a
[190 - 196] bride we had white and I'm super lazy
[196 - 198] and don't have a lot of crafting
[198 - 203] materials I just used regular tape put
[203 - 207] it on my sail material and dock it in
[207 - 211] the back so it would come out of the
[211 - 213] back of our thing and I put a few layers
[213 - 216] that are always anyway so that's how we
[216 - 217] run around the what the bride had a
[217 - 220] black hat and had a white veil and it
[220 - 222] was super funny and cute and easy and
[222 - 224] everyone loves them

[239 - 239] there you go do you like that book no
[239 - 246] Zack Winston yeah didn't you

[8 - 9] hey guys bill here and today we're going
[9 - 11] to be making paper hats and I've already
[11 - 14] made one if you want to take a look this

[37 - 39] this side you don't it all like bumpy
[39 - 44] and you do the heart so that's how flat
[44 - 46] it should be and then you want to fold
[46 - 49] it in half again so we fold it like this
[49 - 52] you need to fold it so it's perfectly
[52 - 56] not off the edge so I need to do it like
[56 - 59] that now we have to make sure it's
[59 - 64] flutters down like that playgirl press
[64 - 67] and all the rest out and that's the
[67 - 69] second part and now we need to fold it
[69 - 73] back out to get that was just to give us
[73 - 75] 10 tonight page so now we need to fold
[75 - 78] this part of the paper we just go like
[78 - 80] this we need to make sure it's right on
[80 - 83] the middle right on target that make
[83 - 87] sure top right just like that I mean
[87 - 91] lots of the flowers much as we can there
[91 - 94] we go so you have to do it to the crease
[94 - 96] in the middle that's what the creased is
[96 - 98] fought and now we have to do it to this
[98 - 101] side now straight to the middle make

[127 - 131] have to fold this part or so you get the
[131 - 133] side of the half to make sure perfectly
[133 - 138] flat now we do the opposite side exactly
[138 - 142] the same that's why we have the need the

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] today we're going to make hats oh did
[3 - 5] you see I took off my hat
[5 - 6] that's right take off your hat it'll
[6 - 8] take my dog we're gonna make hats out of
[8 - 12] newspaper and for this all you need is
[12 - 14] newspaper so I'll take one of these one
[14 - 16] sheet while you're there so what do we
[16 - 19] read in today no no no we're just not
[19 - 21] reading we're making hats we're making
[21 - 24] hat so all right so normally a newspaper
[24 - 26] is already folded so we can already
[26 - 27] leave that folded right there
[27 - 29] great just like this and we're going to
[29 - 31] take that and we're going to you know
[31 - 33] they say what did they say when when
[33 - 35] you're folding it there's hot dog and
[35 - 37] hamburger is that right so that's ham
[37 - 40] hamburger is a cross you know so you
[40 - 42] have a wider one and then hotdog would
[42 - 44] be the thinner one right yep
[44 - 46] so what we want to do is we want to give
[46 - 49] one fold in half hamburger style number
[49 - 52] seven all right so then we're making a
[52 - 55] crease right down the middle of it it
[55 - 56] doesn't even it doesn't have to be
[56 - 58] perfect that pair of nothing has to be
[58 - 61] right so now we have a nice crease right
[61 - 63] there right in the middle and now we're
[63 - 66] going to make we're going to fold the
[66 - 68] corners the top two corners where the
[68 - 71] fold is you see that there's already
[71 - 72] pulled down we're going to fold those
[72 - 75] corners in at the half
[75 - 78] like right along that crease so there's
[78 - 81] one side you see and then here's the
[81 - 83] other side and we'll both do them on the
[83 - 89] same same side here so now what you have
[89 - 93] should look like this that's what you
[93 - 95] should be seeing and this should be kind
[95 - 97] of open on the bottom right did you have
[97 - 99] a couple scoops oh how you doing there
[99 - 101] Brian I think I'm doing pretty well
[101 - 105] all right good so now the next step is
[105 - 107] that we're going to see yeah the bottom
[107 - 109] edge around here right here and you see
[109 - 111] how you have two sheets it looks like
[111 - 113] you have two sheets of paper there
[113 - 115] together for we're going to fold the
[115 - 118] first sheet of paper up so just one yeah
[118 - 120] and it's kind of like I guess hot dog
[120 - 123] style you're gonna pull it right all the
[123 - 125] way up make it so it looks like this
[125 - 128] right yeah that's right it's a nice
[128 - 130] thick creaser so then so this is what
[130 - 132] that side should look like is that you
[132 - 134] folded right along this
[134 - 138] were those two triangles where those two
[138 - 140] corners came in and you fold it right up
[140 - 143] along here okay so now you're gonna flip
[143 - 147] it over so you see just the back back
[147 - 150] and now this is where we're gonna size
[150 - 152] it now I have a really big head so I'm
[152 - 155] only gonna do small yeah so I'm gonna
[155 - 158] make I'll make a smaller hat for the
[158 - 159] people on the internet because they
[159 - 160] probably don't have as big a head as I
[160 - 162] do and then you're trying to make a big
[162 - 164] hat so they could fit around your food
[164 - 166] around my head so what what we do here
[166 - 170] is we take these sides the whole side
[170 - 172] right here and we fold it in so here's
[172 - 174] one side we're gonna fold this in you
[174 - 177] know we're Emison as much as our much so
[177 - 180] if you have like a smaller head you can
[180 - 183] fold it in like you know a couple three
[183 - 186] inches right there but if you have a
[186 - 188] bigger head like me you can fold it in
[188 - 191] fold it in just a little bit like that
[191 - 193] now do the same on the other side fold
[193 - 198] it up and in like that make a nice
[198 - 200] little crease so now if you're holding
[200 - 202] them because they're gonna try to flap
[202 - 203] out they look like this so this is what
[203 - 207] your back should look like and then just
[207 - 209] like on the front side you're going to
[209 - 212] fold this right up fold this bottom edge
[212 - 215] right up so now it's all and not on the
[215 - 217] same size but on the opposite so on the
[217 - 219] opposite side so now you'll still have
[219 - 221] that little space right in the middle
[221 - 224] and that's a base that your head goes no
[224 - 228] if you start popping it out a little bit
[228 - 230] you're the Apple about it it fits my
[230 - 232] head does it fit your head I got it
[232 - 236] perfect size the one size fits all it's
[236 - 238] supposed to go to the front leg well you

- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 7] hi my name is Laura I'm an artist and
[7 - 8] I'm going to show you how to make a
[8 - 11] three sided paper hat what you're going
[11 - 14] to need is a sheet of paper I have an
[14 - 16] eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper
[16 - 19] it's going to make a small hat so if you
[19 - 21] want to make a larger hat use a larger
[21 - 22] sheet of paper
[22 - 25] so first the first step is you're gonna
[25 - 29] fold the paper in half lengthwise like
[29 - 33] this after you fold it use your
[33 - 38] fingernail to to make that fold sharper
[38 - 42] and then what you're going to do is make
[42 - 44] sure that the folded side is away from
[44 - 49] you the open edges toward you fold the
[49 - 52] upper right and left hand corners in
[52 - 53] toward each other so that they meet in
[53 - 56] the middle and then do a sort of
[56 - 60] temporary temporary fold and then again
[60 - 62] sharpen that with your fingernail on
[62 - 68] both sides and you'll have flaps left
[68 - 70] facing towards you what you're going to
[70 - 76] do is fold one side up on one side
[76 - 79] fingernail it down and then flip it over
[79 - 83] and take that other flap up on the other
[83 - 90] side and then you have one two three
[90 - 95] corners on your hat and you can put it
[95 - 99] on your head like that I am Laura thank
[99 - 101] you for watching how to make a three
[101 - 105] sided paper hat

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hey everybody this is gonna be a
[2 - 5] tutorial on how to make a paper hat so
[5 - 7] the first step is you want to draw three
[7 - 10] shapes that look like this now the first
[10 - 13] shape you draw is gonna have a curve
[13 - 16] right there and then the second one is
[16 - 19] gonna be a little bit less curved but a
[19 - 21] slant going up there but a small slit
[21 - 23] and then the third is going to be the
[23 - 25] smallest piece and the less curved on
[25 - 27] the edge once you have this drawing out
[27 - 28] what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut
[28 - 31] each one out after you cut them out
[31 - 32] you're gonna have three of these and
[32 - 35] you're gonna take one of them put them
[35 - 37] on a white piece of paper and trace
[37 - 39] around because what you're doing is
[39 - 41] you're you're making two of each shape
[41 - 43] and so you're making sure that each one
[43 - 45] is the same size as the one before
[45 - 47] because if it's not the hats not gonna
[47 - 54] fit together correctly and once you have
[54 - 56] all those traced what you're gonna do is
[56 - 58] take some scissors and you're gonna cut
[58 - 63] each one out this is the time to color
[63 - 66] them and if you want to once you have
[66 - 67] them all cut out what you're gonna do is
[67 - 69] you're gonna take one of them and you're
[69 - 71] gonna draw lines like this around the
[71 - 73] edge these represent the seams of the
[73 - 76] Hat and if you want to you can also do a
[76 - 79] dotted line for these instead but you
[79 - 82] can do it however you want and you're
[82 - 88] gonna do that for every single one
[90 - 90] make sure that for these pieces the two
[90 - 92] largest ones the slant is going down on
[92 - 94] that side and going up on that one it's
[94 - 98] almost like a mirror image once you have
[98 - 100] them all drawn on what you're gonna do
[100 - 103] is you're gonna take these to make sure
[103 - 105] it's those two take a piece of tape tape
[105 - 107] on the back and then you're gonna put
[107 - 109] together you are now starting to put the
[109 - 115] Hat together take another piece of tape
[115 - 117] and put it on the back and put them
[117 - 119] together you're gonna be doing this for
[119 - 122] each one just make sure that you don't
[122 - 124] tape too close to the top because when
[124 - 126] you're done sometimes it doesn't fit
[126 - 129] together quite right so you want to make
[129 - 130] sure you have enough room if you need to
[130 - 133] adjust now the next two pieces is you
[133 - 136] want to put ones of the smallest ones on
[136 - 138] one side and the other smallest piece on
[138 - 141] the other side each side has to be
[141 - 142] symmetrical because if you don't put
[142 - 144] them in to get together in the right
[144 - 145] order the hats not going to come out
[145 - 147] right so you have to make sure you're
[147 - 151] doing it in this order and then take
[151 - 154] that other small piece and attach it to
[154 - 173] the other side like that
[175 - 175] now for the two largest pieces which are
[175 - 176] the two lost you have to be careful
[176 - 179] about this make sure that the slants on
[179 - 181] this are going kind of in the mirror
[181 - 184] image again going opposite but then
[184 - 185] after that you just do what you've been
[185 - 187] doing the whole time taping on the back
[187 - 191] and then putting together like this just
[191 - 193] like that just make sure that the slants
[193 - 201] are going the opposite direction
[204 - 204] these two last pieces are usually the
[204 - 206] most difficult to put together because
[206 - 207] everything is a little bit crowded
[207 - 210] because it's making the circular shape
[210 - 214] so it may be a little bit difficult in
[214 - 216] the video you can tell that I'm gonna
[216 - 219] have a little bit of trouble with it but
[219 - 221] it seemed pretty easy to work around but
[221 - 225] just keep taping to the back and then
[225 - 231] putting it together like that and if you
[231 - 233] have a gap at the top that's completely
[233 - 235] fine or if you have a little bit of tape
[235 - 241] left over there don't worry about it and
[241 - 243] if you do have any extra tape up there
[243 - 245] what you can do is just take some
[245 - 247] scissors and cut off the extra tape and
[247 - 248] don't worry about that gap at the top
[248 - 252] because that's gonna be covered up later
[252 - 254] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[254 - 256] take some cardboard make sure it's thin
[256 - 257] cardboard you can use anything you want
[257 - 259] as you can see here I use some Ritz
[259 - 262] cardboard so you can do anything you
[262 - 269] really want make about six tabs like
[269 - 272] that you you actually really only need
[272 - 277] four but um I'm just doing that in case
[277 - 279] I mess out so then take some tape you
[279 - 281] can bend it too it might make it easier
[281 - 283] and then put it in like that and just
[283 - 287] keep taping around the entire hat this
[287 - 288] is to make the Hat more sturdy and it
[288 - 292] also gives the Hat the round shape so
[292 - 294] that if you wear it it won't crumble or
[294 - 297] anything when you put it on and so just
[297 - 299] keep taping around the top and bottom
[299 - 300] make sure they're on there correctly
[300 - 303] make sure they won't fall off and you
[303 - 305] may notice you can see through the white
[305 - 307] hat to the cardboard but that's fine if
[307 - 309] you have your head actually colored in
[309 - 311] right now you um you probably can't even
[311 - 315] see it so it's fine now what you're
[315 - 317] gonna do is you're gonna make the brim
[317 - 319] for that so put the Hat down like that
[319 - 322] and you're gonna make kind of a half
[322 - 328] circle like this yeah and kind of draw
[328 - 331] it in lightly in case you mess up so you
[331 - 333] can erase it and there won't be any left
[333 - 334] over
[334 - 338] marks and once you have it right or how
[338 - 341] you like it just go around and darken it
[341 - 345] back in like that and then put the hat
[346 - 348] back on and you're just gonna make a
[348 - 351] half circle around the edges like this
[351 - 357] and by now which it look like a half
[357 - 361] moon and then just darken it in and then
[361 - 364] once you have it all darken in you're
[364 - 367] gonna cut it out with some scissors and
[367 - 370] this is when you can color the Birman if
[370 - 373] you want to now what we're gonna do is
[373 - 376] you're gonna take some pencil and you're
[376 - 378] gonna draw some lines like this these
[378 - 383] represent the seams of the brim so just
[383 - 389] draw it around like that you can also do
[389 - 392] these dotted lines here instead if you
[392 - 395] want but you can do it any way and just
[395 - 398] keep doing that but before you get to
[398 - 401] the very end about this point stop and
[401 - 406] just leave that area blank in there now
[406 - 407] you're gonna take some cardboard and
[407 - 412] you're gonna trace around the paper it's
[412 - 414] okay if the cardboard is a little bit
[414 - 417] too small as you can see here I have him
[417 - 418] used a little bit too small a piece but
[418 - 420] it's fine just make sure it's not too
[420 - 422] small and then you're gonna cut it out
[422 - 425] because this is gonna make the brim more
[425 - 428] stiff
[430 - 430] and then you're gonna take some glue
[430 - 433] glue the cardboard and then you're just
[433 - 437] gonna put the brim the paper broom onto
[437 - 443] the cardboard
[446 - 446] once you're done with that you can flip
[446 - 449] it over and if you have any writing like
[449 - 453] here and writing like that what you do
[453 - 457] is you trace around and then you cut
[457 - 459] that out and then you're just gonna put
[459 - 460] it over the words or whatever there is
[460 - 462] there so you don't see it and then put
[462 - 464] it down like that and if you can still
[464 - 466] see through you just do it again
[466 - 469] and then you won't be able to see it now
[469 - 470] what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[470 - 473] make sure that shape is the same shape
[473 - 475] you see on the Hat it has to be that
[475 - 478] shape because that's the front tape the
[478 - 487] brim put a few pieces on and tape it to
[487 - 490] the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on
[490 - 499] straight
[502 - 502] now you're gonna fill that gap in so
[502 - 505] take some paper cut out a square
[505 - 511] rectangular shape and you're gonna glue
[511 - 520] the inside of the Hat like this
[523 - 523] and then Pat that down inside and then
[523 - 533] you can't see through anymore like that
[536 - 536] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[536 - 538] make the airholes for that so take some
[538 - 541] paper and draw six circles and put dark
[541 - 545] dots in the middle of each one and then
[545 - 552] cut them out
[554 - 554] once you have them all cut out take some
[554 - 557] glue glue the bottom of them and paste
[557 - 574] them on in these areas on the Hat
[577 - 577] now we're gonna make the very top of the
[577 - 581] Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a
[581 - 584] strip about this big I actually think I
[584 - 587] made it a little bit too long take some
[587 - 590] glue glue the end and make a circle
[590 - 593] shape about this size and glue both ends
[593 - 600] together once you have that done take a
[600 - 602] piece of paper cut out a circle about
[602 - 609] this big take the other piece glue the
[609 - 614] bottom put that on top and then once you
[614 - 619] get that on glue the other side you
[619 - 620] might want to use a little bit more glue
[620 - 622] than I did here and then put that on the
[622 - 627] top right there now this is the point
[627 - 630] when you can put logos on here here here
[630 - 633] I used EC and a bunch of them but you
[633 - 635] can do anything you want and also you
[635 - 637] can go online print this sticker off
[637 - 641] glue the back and put it on the brim to
[641 - 644] give it a more realistic look and there
[644 - 647] you go there's your hat if you have any
[647 - 649] questions you can message me and I'll
[649 - 652] answer anything if you want you can also
[652 - 654] put your video of your hat as a video
[654 - 657] response to this I'd love to see it good
[657 - 659] luck

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[3 - 3] I'm going to show you how to make this
[3 - 6] fun bowlers hat for Saint Patrick's Day
[6 - 8] or any other occasion for which you
[8 - 10] would need a bowlers hat the first thing
[10 - 11] you're going to need is your newspaper
[11 - 14] base that's done with one that has a
[14 - 17] deep Bowl for the Hat put it out on the
[18 - 20] table you get it as flat as you can
[20 - 23] around the edges and once you have that
[23 - 25] done you're simply going to start
[25 - 29] rolling the edges up and just gonna roll
[29 - 33] all the way around because you're kind
[33 - 36] of preparing this newspaper to be your
[36 - 39] bowlers hat once you've gone around the
[39 - 44] first time go ahead and start taping it
[44 - 47] all the way around you might have to
[47 - 49] take fairly often but you might not it
[49 - 52] depends on your newspaper once you've
[52 - 53] gotten your hat to the point where you
[53 - 57] taped it all up you can look at it and
[57 - 61] see if it's in as close as you want and
[61 - 65] has that bowler hat look to it once you
[65 - 68] have done that you're going to want to
[68 - 71] take tempera paint or any other paint I
[71 - 73] took this tempered paint put it in a big
[73 - 76] paper plate and use the large brush to
[76 - 79] paint the whole hat newspaper is very
[79 - 81] thin paper and it takes a long time to
[81 - 83] dry so you want to make sure your hat is
[83 - 85] completely dry before you start
[85 - 87] decorating it but in the meantime you
[87 - 89] can cut out what you're going to use to
[89 - 94] make your decorations I use simply three
[94 - 96] hearts that I cut out of construction
[96 - 101] paper and I made them the same size so I
[101 - 105] use the first one as a template cut the
[105 - 116] second one and cut the third one
[122 - 122] and for these I covered them with
[122 - 126] Elmer's glue and then I sprinkled green
[126 - 131] glitter on them and let it dry and once
[131 - 135] that was done I put them together three
[135 - 137] hearts with a little dab of glue I'll
[137 - 138] put a little piece of tape that'll give
[138 - 143] you the idea and my shamrock was ready
[143 - 146] to go from my bowlers hat then once my
[146 - 149] hat was dry I started making that other
[149 - 152] decorations for it no there's your
[152 - 154] shamrock to go in the middle of your hat
[154 - 159] I used shamrock confetti and I used
[159 - 163] glitter glue and I just made some
[163 - 165] decorations around the brim of the Hat
[165 - 169] took my Elmer's glue and put on the
[169 - 171] confetti and glued the shamrock to the
[171 - 173] middle with a little piece of confetti
[173 - 175] now you can of course make a bowlers hat
[175 - 178] any color for any occasion but this is
[178 - 183] how I made a st. Patrick's Day bowler
[183 - 187] hat out of newspaper

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats this very
[8 - 10] fun party hat is made out of only three
[10 - 13] pieces of construction paper this is the
[13 - 15] smaller paper the first thing you want
[15 - 21] to do is take the smaller paper and just
[21 - 26] wrap it around your head until it fits
[26 - 32] and tape or staple it nothing to it
[32 - 37] really once you have your hat secured
[37 - 39] might want to take a special pair of
[39 - 42] scissors but the fancy edges and cut
[42 - 44] around the edge so that you have an edge
[44 - 47] that looks like this and you know if you
[47 - 49] don't have the fancy scissors to do this
[49 - 51] kind of an edge you can always just tear
[51 - 54] the paper and that too will give you a
[54 - 57] fancy edge now one thing that you can do
[57 - 60] too before you even cut out your hat
[60 - 63] before you staple it is to leave it open
[63 - 66] and decorate it you might want to write
[66 - 70] happy birthday and crayon or use markers
[70 - 73] or even use glitter and glue once you've
[73 - 75] done that you put your hat together and
[75 - 78] then you want to make this this is the
[78 - 82] fun stuff and it's so easy to make cut
[82 - 84] out a variety of sizes and colors of
[84 - 87] circles and then just start cutting out
[87 - 89] your circle you want to stay fairly
[89 - 92] close to the edge but it does not have
[92 - 95] to be even that's the beauty of it and
[95 - 97] you just keep cutting until you keep
[97 - 101] Spile spiraling around and you have it
[101 - 103] looking like this and then you take the
[103 - 109] center and stretch it as you can see I
[109 - 111] used several pieces of yellow and
[111 - 114] several pieces of purple I started out
[114 - 116] with a large circle with the purple and
[116 - 119] this was a small circle with the yellow
[119 - 122] put them all together staple them at the
[122 - 128] top shook them out and here we go a
[128 - 131] really fun crazy
[131 - 134] happy birthday hat it would work for new
[134 - 136] to    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[19 - 22] three sheets gives you a more sturdy hat
[22 - 25] that are two-sided all the way no half
[25 - 27] sheets lay it out in front of you
[27 - 31] sideways with your fold at the front and

[34 - 39] fold it down to the middle not quite
[39 - 43] centered up and down again leaving a
[43 - 45] little bit of space at the top so that

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[21 - 21] decorate your mash a pirate ship using
[21 - 23] acrylic paint you can have lots of fun
[23 - 25] coming up with a really piratey color
[25 - 32] scheme
[36 - 36] the next step is to fold your card in
[36 - 39] half this is going to create the larger
[39 - 42] waves to go around the outside of your
[42 - 45] hat fold it in half and then we're going
[45 - 60] to draw the wave shape along the paper
[63 - 63] this time to make the smaller waves fold
[63 - 66] your paper in half along the long side
[66 - 78] of the paper and then fold it again
[81 - 81] so you'll find this is slightly more
[81 - 83] difficult to cut through because there's
[83 - 87] four layers of card to cut through so
[87 - 88] you may have to be a bit tougher with
[88 - 92] your scissors but it's well worth it
[92 - 94] because the effect is fantastic at the
[94 - 97] end cut the leaves down the center along
[97 - 106] the fold
[108 - 108] if you have a little extra on the bottom
[108 - 110] you could always just sand that off
[110 - 113] using your glue gun run a line of glue
[113 - 119] along the bottom of your boat and then
[119 - 124] securely attaches to the Hat you'll need
[124 - 125] to hold this in place for a few minutes
[125 - 129] just so it sticks securely so it doesn't
[129 - 130] matter if it's completely straight
[130 - 132] because waves are choppy so it just adds
[132 - 135] to the sea effect next we're going to
[135 - 137] attach the waves to the Hat I'm going to
[137 - 139] use a glue gun but you could use a
[139 - 143] stapler Sini's stick lots of glue onto
[143 - 148] your waves and mold it to the shape of
[148 - 153] the Hat holding it firmly you might need
[153 - 156] to cut your waves to size so it fits
[156 - 163] around the Hat it doesn't matter if it
[163 - 165] overlaps a little bit because the other
[165 - 166] waves are going to go around the edge
[166 - 169] next we're going to attach our smaller
[169 - 174] waves around the edge of the Hat we're
[174 - 175] going to use exactly the same processes
[175 - 180] the larger waves gluing just over the
[180 - 185] top to give this layered effect you will
[185 - 187] need an adult's help with the glue gun
[187 - 189] because it does get very hot I'm going
[189 - 195] to add some treasure to my bonnet you
[195 - 196] can put it wherever you fancy so it
[196 - 199] could be around the boat or it could be
[199 - 200] at the bottom of the ocean it's
[200 - 204] completely up to you and firmly place
[204 - 208] the coins onto the Hat
[208 - 210] if you have any overlapping sections in
[210 - 212] your waves you could always put one of
[212 - 217] the coins over the top so when you stuck
[217 - 218] on your coins
[218 - 221] it obviously adds some sparkle to your
[221 - 228] hat we're going to add the bunting so
[228 - 230] you can attach this however you like you
[230 - 231] could use as little or as much as you
[231 - 233] like so I'm going to attach it the top
[233 - 238] just with a little blob of glue and you
[238 - 241] can cut off any excess just adds the
[241 - 260] finishing touches to your pirate ship    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] in this clip I'm going to show you how
[2 - 5] to make a paper top hat you're gonna
[5 - 8] take a piece of paper a paper plate here
[8 - 10] you can take your scissors and you're
[10 - 12] going to cut out the middle by carefully
[12 - 15] poking the scissors through the top and
[15 - 19] cutting leaving a little bit of the
[19 - 23] paper plate on the top and notice that I
[23 - 26] turned the paper plate over or upside
[26 - 31] down I quickly cut that out all the way
[31 - 34] around and then I'm going to take just a
[34 - 37] regular piece of construction paper and
[37 - 39] I'm going to fold down the top just a
[39 - 42] little bit to give it some sturdy nuts
[42 - 46] because I want it to really hold
[46 - 48] together well I'm gonna put a glue stick
[48 - 53] on here pull that down and then I'm
[53 - 56] going to also fold up the bottom about a
[56 - 58] half of an inch and this is going to
[58 - 65] allow the paper top-hat to fit inside of
[65 - 66] the paper plate and I'm going to cut
[66 - 69] little slits around here which will help
[69 - 75] mold it into a circle okay the last
[75 - 76] thing I want to do is I want to overlap
[76 - 78] these so I'm going to put a little bit
[78 - 80] of glue here and I'm going to go ahead
[80 - 87] and put these two together like that and
[87 - 91] there take a piece of tape and put this
[91 - 93] right in the middle where I'm
[93 - 96] overlapping it just to support it a
[96 - 98] little bit now I'm going to put this
[98 - 102] right inside of my paper plate and I'm
[102 - 104] going to turn it upside down and I'm
[104 - 108] going to start gluing these tabs onto
[108 - 112] the paper plate just like you see here
[112 - 115] and I'm going to go ahead and show you
[115 - 118] that this last one and I want to support
[118 - 122] it again with a piece of tape and the
[122 - 125] very last thing I'm going to do is I'm
[125 - 128] going to take my magic marker and I'm
[128 - 130] going to go ahead and make that brim
[130 - 135] black and you have a great top hat    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] hi in this video I'm going to show you
[3 - 6] how you can create an imaginative Easter
[6 - 8] bonnet with your child using simple
[8 - 12] paper mache techniques first of all you
[12 - 15] need a balloon if you're making
[15 - 17] something like this out of an egg shape
[17 - 20] or if you want to make an animal or a
[20 - 23] bird you'll need a small balloon for the
[23 - 26] head and a larger balloon for the body
[26 - 33] so first of all you need to inflate the
[33 - 36] large balloon sit it in a saucepan or
[36 - 40] bowl so it sits securely while you're
[40 - 44] applying the strips of newspaper I've
[44 - 48] cut mine into 1 by 5 inch strips but you
[48 - 50] don't have to be approximate that's only
[50 - 52] approximate you don't have to do it
[52 - 55] exactly the other thing you'll need is a
[55 - 58] pot of PVA glue which has some water in
[58 - 60] so it's running and you'll need a
[60 - 63] paintbrush and your meal apron that will
[63 - 65] cover your child because it can get
[65 - 69] messy so what I recommend is that you
[69 - 71] get your child to cover an area of the
[71 - 75] balloon with glue and I'll show you that
[75 - 79] it should just run on the balloon quite
[79 - 82] easily and then when you've covered an
[82 - 86] area the balloon in PVA close then apply
[86 - 89] strips running in the same direction all
[89 - 95] around the balloon then apply another
[95 - 98] another layer of glue put on the strip's
[98 - 101] going in the opposite direction
[101 - 103] overlapping slightly so there are no
[103 - 107] gaps and then your third layer will go
[108 - 110] back to the original direction and then
[110 - 112] I recommend that for the final layer you
[112 - 116] apply some kitchen towel strips or some
[116 - 118] paper to have strips and because this
[119 - 122] provides a really good base for
[122 - 126] painting it helps it make sure that the
[126 - 128] print doesn't show through or it
[128 - 130] provides a good base if you're wanting
[130 - 135] to put squares of tissue paper onto the
[135 - 139] balloon so after about 24 hours in a
[139 - 142] really warm place your balloon will
[142 - 146] hopefully dry so that it's it's it's
[146 - 154] very solid pop the balloon and cut up a
[154 - 157] circular hole in the bottom large enough
[157 - 161] for the top of the Hat it should should
[161 - 164] fit securely on and then if you're
[164 - 166] wanting to make an Easter basket like
[166 - 169] this all you have to do is is cut a
[169 - 173] section out of each side leaving a
[173 - 175] handle shape down the middle and then
[175 - 177] your child could fill it with things
[177 - 180] that they've made here I've got homemade
[180 - 184] daffodils and decoupage eggs and some
[184 - 187] tissue paper shred or if you're
[187 - 191] interested in making one of the animals
[191 - 197] then your your need and some tissue
[197 - 200] paper shred for their for their fur or
[200 - 204] for their coat now to help you to sit
[204 - 206] the head on top of the body what I
[206 - 209] recommend is that you have used some
[209 - 211] duct tape to make some crisscross shapes
[211 - 214] at the bottom of the head and stick that
[214 - 216] on top of the body so that it's secure
[216 - 218] because what you don't want is for the
[218 - 221] kids to fall off during the Easter
[221 - 228] bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you
[228 - 230] there were three kits available there's
[230 - 233] a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and
[233 - 235] there's a lamb kit and
[236 - 238] come with all materials that you'll need
[238 - 241] to make an Easter bonnet as well as the
[241 - 244] bonnet and a list of instructions to
[244 - 246] help you go through it step by step but
[246 - 248] if you have any questions or any ideas
[248 - 250] that you want to discuss please get in
[250 - 254] touch thank you for watching

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[15 - 22] happy birthday to that girl Tyson happy
[22 - 26] birthday to me that's right
[26 - 29] today is my birthday November 30th
[29 - 32] that is the day I was brought forth into
[32 - 34] this world which is also why I'm all
[34 - 37] dolled up I'm even wearing a party dress
[37 - 39] party dress and I put something in my
[39 - 42] hair it's a hairband and I have makeup
[42 - 43] on which actually feels really
[43 - 44] uncomfortable because I don't really
[44 - 46] wear makeup now because I dismembered
[46 - 48] Thanos all about fun and festivities and
[48 - 50] cake and presents well actually I had no
[50 - 53] fun or festivities plan but I think
[53 - 54] there will be cake and hopefully a
[54 - 57] present or two I have decided to make a
[57 - 59] party hat that's right we are going to
[59 - 61] make a party hat it's arts and crafts
[61 - 63] I'm here at that Colonel Tyson I know
[63 - 66] you all are so excited so without
[66 - 68] further ado let's make a party hat to
[68 - 69] make this project you're gonna need a
[69 - 70] piece of paper
[70 - 72] I chose bread so much is my Percy pretty
[72 - 77] dress and scissors tape glue and
[77 - 79] something to decorate your party hat
[79 - 81] with first you're gonna need to make a
[81 - 84] complete square out of your construction
[84 - 87] paper then you're gonna make your hat
[87 - 89] all you have to do is roll your piece of
[89 - 91] paper into a cone now to do that you
[91 - 96] just roll your paper you're going to
[96 - 101] tape it ever notice how that first piece
[101 - 105] of tape just never feels right now
[105 - 109] you're gonna cut it this paper off I'm
[109 - 111] not the best hat maker and I'm just
[111 - 114] winging it cuz once you have your cowan
[114 - 123] you decorate it
[125 - 125] now I suggest using stickers as well
[125 - 127] especially letter stickers and if you
[127 - 130] were having a birthday party and there
[130 - 131] were a bunch of different kids you could
[131 - 133] put their names on them which is kind of
[133 - 136] cool and certain stickers will add your
[136 - 139] own unique flair to your hat I think
[139 - 140] this is great for birthday parties and
[140 - 142] if I ever have kids it's totally
[142 - 144] something I would do it has some of
[144 - 147] these steampunk ears that I'm going to
[147 - 150] put on my hat okay cool
[150 - 157] Naomi I'm all about being cool
[159 - 159] and now I'm going to put my name on it
[159 - 160] you know so what the other partygoers
[161 - 163] know who I am awesome
[163 - 165] now you just let you have dry for a few
[165 - 170] minutes and of course you have to ensure
[170 - 172] that it was going to stay on your head
[172 - 174] so the best way to do that is to get
[174 - 180] some string or some elastic and thread
[180 - 182] the elastic through for some strange
[182 - 184] reason I cannot find my string and so
[184 - 188] I'm going to use party ribbon and voila
[188 - 191] you have a super awesome personalized
[191 - 195] party hat let me just add my party hat
[195 - 201] onto my head alright here I am what do
[201 - 204] you think I bet you know you will never
[204 - 207] ever buy another party hat because it's
[207 - 210] so simple to make and they look amazing
[210 - 212] talent arts and crafts time is over
[212 - 214] I'm gonna go ahead and say goodbye I
[214 - 215] hope you all have a fabulous day and
[215 - 217] I'll see you all again here next week
[217 - 228] for another edition of back melted and

[231 - 234] shoving it all in your desk like this
[234 - 238] and closing it

[8 - 8] hello and welcome back to the insane
[8 - 10] knitters the YouTube video channel this
[10 - 14] is going to be a demonstration of a flat
[14 - 16] hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a
[16 - 19] lot of hats are knit in the round on a
[19 - 21] cable needle and they they're you know
[21 - 23] you just knit them in a circle and then
[23 - 25] you decrease to the top and you finish
[25 - 27] it that way a flat hat is knit on
[27 - 30] straight needles like this with just a
[30 - 33] large piece of fabric and a lot of
[33 - 35] people make hats this way it does
[35 - 37] involve some seaming and I'll show you
[37 - 41] that but what I'm using here is really
[41 - 43] big needles and really thick yarn this
[43 - 47] is called encore mega and on a size 15
[47 - 48] needle it gives you two stitches per
[48 - 51] inch and that's just something I'm using
[51 - 54] right now and I'll tell you why it makes
[54 - 56] a quick it's a very quick knit just
[56 - 59] quick quick turn it up and it it's very
[59 - 61] thick and you only generally need one
[61 - 64] skein to do this you can use two it
[64 - 67] tells you on the label
[67 - 70] how many yards it is and it's this is
[71 - 73] sixty four yards on and I'm using a
[73 - 76] smaller needle than it calls for so I'm
[76 - 77] getting a little more yardage out of
[77 - 80] this to knit with but that's neither
[80 - 81] here nor there you can use any yarn you
[81 - 83] want for this I'm just using the thick
[83 - 85] yarn and the big needles too to show you
[85 - 88] because it's easier um when you want to
[88 - 90] make a flat hat uh
[90 - 93] like I said you is a thick skein of yarn
[93 - 95] to give me about two stitches per inch
[95 - 98] because it's it's a quick knit and I
[98 - 101] find it easier but you can do this with
[101 - 102] baby yarn you can do this with any yarn
[102 - 105] you want as long as you measure properly
[105 - 107] and that is really the thing you want to
[107 - 110] cast on enough stitches on your needles
[110 - 115] to make the length as high as you want
[115 - 118] the hat to be so if you need the Hat to
[118 - 121] be 10 inches high you know so you've got
[121 - 123] good six inches of coverage on your hat
[123 - 126] then you want to cast on enough stitches
[126 - 131] because this is going to be however
[131 - 134] however why it is is going to be how it
[134 - 138] sits on your head so and then you want
[138 - 141] to knit - however you however long you
[141 - 143] want it to be around generally the most
[143 - 146] average hat is the average person's head
[146 - 149] is about 20 to 22 inches you know the
[149 - 151] kids are obviously smaller than that and
[151 - 153] people come in different sizes so you
[153 - 157] just want to knit as long as you want
[157 - 159] your hat to be around and I'll show you
[159 - 163] why what I have done here is I've knit
[163 - 165] to the point to where I want to bind off
[165 - 168] okay I think this is about 12 inches so
[168 - 170] it's going to make a small hat and now
[170 - 172] I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go
[172 - 173] ahead and do that and I'll come back in
[173 - 175] a minute when I'm bound off and I'll
[175 - 177] show you what and we're back
[177 - 179] okay I have bound off this piece of
[179 - 182] fabric to the last stitch and I'll show
[182 - 185] you what to do now
[185 - 188] we've got our last stitch here and you
[188 - 192] want to finish that up no but you want
[193 - 194] it the thing is is we're going to seam
[194 - 196] this now so you want to instead of just
[196 - 198] cutting this off really close and
[198 - 200] binding it off that way you want to
[200 - 205] leave a long piece long piece of tail
[205 - 206] yarn here because we're going to use
[206 - 210] this piece to sew up the Hat so you want
[210 - 213] to leave really long tail to sew with so
[213 - 217] okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much
[217 - 224] okay and then we're gonna cut this
[226 - 226] and then we're gonna pull it through
[226 - 229] okay so there we go that's our last
[229 - 231] stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn
[231 - 234] through and we're gonna there we go now
[234 - 236] we're bound off completely here okay
[236 - 239] there we go now this is the piece of
[239 - 243] fabric that I knitted and what we're
[243 - 246] going to do is we're going to take a
[246 - 250] yarn needle if you don't have a yarn
[250 - 253] needle they come in various kinds this
[253 - 255] is a large one so because I'm using
[255 - 262] really big yarn here this is the piece I
[262 - 265] knitted okay here's the the cast on edge
[265 - 267] this is where I started knitting and
[268 - 270] then I knit it however long I want my
[270 - 273] hat to be generally this one's about 12
[273 - 278] inches and but you know like I said
[278 - 282] normally you'd knit however long two to
[282 - 284] make it or whoever you're knitting it
[284 - 287] for measuring heads is kind of weird but
[287 - 291] you can do it just you know or you can
[291 - 292] take your best guess like I said the
[292 - 295] average hat the average size is about 20
[295 - 299] to 22 inches depending on on the person
[299 - 303] you're knitting for so here's our our
[303 - 305] cast on edge this is where we started
[305 - 307] Inc this is our cast off edge where we
[307 - 309] stop knitting and this is what we're
[309 - 313] going to do we're going to sew the cast
[313 - 314] on edge
[314 - 317] to the cast-off edge the bind off and
[317 - 320] the bind on we're going to sew those
[320 - 321] together and you're going to end up with
[321 - 324] this two looking thing okay like that so
[324 - 327] you want to take your really long tail
[327 - 330] that you left you also can use another
[330 - 334] piece of yarn to do this you know just
[334 - 336] if you want you can use a different size
[336 - 339] of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I
[339 - 341] used to sew the Hat so that way it
[341 - 347] doesn't show if it gets pulled apart
[347 - 348] okay so here we are we have our yarn
[348 - 353] needle and our yarn and we're going to
[353 - 357] sew these edges together now you can see
[357 - 359] here where your yarn where you bound off
[359 - 361] right there and then you can see the
[361 - 364] edge over here so I generally oh and
[364 - 365] then that's another thing to see this
[365 - 366] pattern I just this is garter stitch
[366 - 368] it's just all knit stitches it's nice
[368 - 370] for hats it's thick it's comfortable but
[370 - 372] you can use any pattern you want you
[372 - 374] don't have to be you don't have to use
[374 - 375] garter stitch I know someone who does
[376 - 377] these in ribbing you can do it every
[377 - 381] pattern you want just remember that one
[381 - 383] side will be inside on the person's head
[383 - 385] and the other side will be on the
[385 - 387] outside so just keep that in mind with
[387 - 389] your pattern but this is just simple
[389 - 390] garter stitch it's all it's knit every
[390 - 392] row just because it works for
[392 - 395] demonstration purposes and also it helps
[395 - 399] me line up what I'm doing here so see
[399 - 400] there's I'm lining up the little rows
[400 - 404] there and now you just take your yarn
[404 - 411] needle and you pick up in between the
[411 - 413] bind off stitches there's these little
[413 - 417] ladders see those right in between each
[417 - 420] of these stitches you can go in and pick
[420 - 423] up that little that little ladder inside
[423 - 426] in it and that really helps you a lot
[426 - 428] when you're sewing and so what we're
[428 - 431] going to do is just seam all the way
[431 - 433] across or I'll show you a couple
[433 - 435] stitches how I do it there's lots of
[435 - 438] ways to do this but this is how I do it
[438 - 441] and so I just come over and I pick up
[441 - 446] the corner first just to secure that
[446 - 452] just to secure them together okay so now
[452 - 454] they're there they're secured they're
[454 - 457] sewn together and then I come in and I
[457 - 463] pick up both sides sorry I bump the
[463 - 465] camera pick up both sides of this stitch
[465 - 470] and both sides of this one and pull that
[470 - 474] through there we go that's sewn together
[474 - 476] this making a flat hat does make a big
[476 - 479] seam down the side and that can be
[479 - 480] uncomfortable for some people when they
[480 - 485] wear stuff but it's just a side effect
[485 - 487] of what this pattern you know of making
[487 - 490] a flat hat so and then that's it I just
[490 - 493] go back and forth I cut this is called
[493 - 495] kind of a whip stitch you just go back
[495 - 500] and forth and sew it up all the way up
[500 - 502] up the sides and you want to make sure
[502 - 506] that you get just about every stitch so
[506 - 510] that way you don't have big holes when
[510 - 514] you when the person puts this hat on so
[514 - 517] see I'm picking up both legs of this
[517 - 520] stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm
[520 - 526] just coming through just like this okay
[526 - 528] and you see how that's being seamed
[528 - 531] together there it's making this little
[531 - 535] making this little line down there down
[535 - 537] the Knitting I'll show you what to do
[537 - 546] with that in a minute so there we go
[548 - 548] see that's another reason I like to use
[548 - 551] the same color of yarn because this way
[551 - 557] it doesn't show very very much
[559 - 559] see when you can tell there's a scene
[559 - 561] there but you can't really see where the
[561 - 564] yarn is because I use the same yarn now
[564 - 565] if I used a different color you could
[565 - 569] really see so pick up both legs of that
[569 - 573] stitch and both legs of the next one and
[573 - 576] come come through
[576 - 579] and I will see you in a minute when I
[579 - 581] get this seemed up in Italy
[581 - 583] okay I'm back I've got this all seem
[583 - 586] down the side now okay
[586 - 587] so now I have this tube see this tube
[587 - 590] thing it's a it's like a it's a tube
[590 - 594] okay and it's not a hat yet but it will
[594 - 596] be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last
[596 - 600] stitch here just like that this is a
[600 - 602] little tail where we started to knit
[602 - 605] remember now this is the part where you
[605 - 607] make your hat okay you're going to
[607 - 611] basically stitch up one of the one of
[611 - 615] the sides here and that's going to close
[615 - 618] one end of the tube and kind of make a
[618 - 621] little hat shape like this okay like
[621 - 623] that so it doesn't look like a hat now
[623 - 625] but when I get this all sewn and I pull
[625 - 628] it really tight it'll make a little hat
[628 - 630] like that and you said you know it's not
[630 - 632] the prettiest thing in the world but it
[632 - 634] does work very well and then you can
[634 - 638] fold this up and and you have a hat for
[638 - 642] whomever you're making it for this is
[642 - 646] the part where their head goes in there
[646 - 649] you go you can fold that up and there's
[649 - 651] the top of the hat so that's how you
[651 - 653] make a flat hat so let's go I'll come
[653 - 655] back just a minute when I get this top
[655 - 658] zone and it's over the top you're going
[658 - 660] to instead of going back and forth like
[660 - 663] we did with this loose with the whip
[663 - 665] stitching you're kind of going to do the
[665 - 667] same thing only you do it on both sides
[668 - 670] so there's where I came out so I'm going
[670 - 673] to go in here like that
[673 - 675] pick up that because this is a different
[675 - 677] edge so it's going to look a little a
[677 - 680] little different because this is a side
[680 - 682] now instead of the bind off edge so
[682 - 684] you're going to go so you came out here
[684 - 686] and then you're going to go back on this
[686 - 689] side and over here like that you make in
[689 - 692] kind of a criss cross one two three four
[692 - 693] instead of going back and forth like
[693 - 698] that so you just go just like this and
[698 - 700] I'll see you in just a second when I get
[700 - 701] this done
[701 - 703] okay I've reached the last stitch now
[703 - 705] and these these are all stitched and I

[717 - 719] really tight like that and see how it
[719 - 722] squishes like that okay you pull it
[722 - 723] really tight and then what I do is I
[723 - 727] take my needle and I just kind of wedge
[727 - 731] it through again just just because guess
[731 - 734] that little gives it a little extra
[734 - 738] tightening okay just like that and you
[738 - 740] can do it again if you want just to use
[740 - 743] up some of the slack on your on your
[743 - 745] needle there or some of the extra yarn
[745 - 748] okay there you go and you know one more
[748 - 752] time why not we're here so there you go
[752 - 755] you pull it tight now you weave in your
[755 - 760] ends
[762 - 762] there's an end and then you pull it
[762 - 765] inside out and there you go you have a
[765 - 770] hat here just a flat hat
[775 - 775] tada you made a hat yay Congrats
[775 - 778] here's your flat head with your ins bulb
[778 - 781] in and there's the broom you can roll it

[793 - 798] pattern you want and in it however you
[798 - 798] like
[798 - 802] there you go but    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[4 - 4] all right okay a nother paper hell - now
[4 - 7] we're going to be making a paper hat and
[7 - 11] do so you will first need to fold the
[11 - 19] paper in half doesn't have to be too
[19 - 25] accurate fold it in half now this bit
[25 - 29] you have to fold over the top half okay
[29 - 34] so that's the middle of the paper you
[34 - 37] can fold it in half gainer sheep just to
[37 - 41] make 9 down the middle that you can see
[41 - 42] okay
[42 - 48] so fold over these top these top pieces
[48 - 56] okay it like you would a paper airplane
[56 - 71] I guess to make this paper hat and it's
[72 - 76] quite a simple thing paper they go what
[76 - 81] more do you need to do opens up how I
[81 - 85] fill it with chips or whatever if you
[85 - 89] want make it look a little neater you
[89 - 101] can fold in these corner pieces and do
[101 - 111] the same on the other side and then
[111 - 116] triangle isn't your style you can then
[116 - 119] fold it down
[119 - 124] and push it in to the little flap there
[124 - 128] and then you have more of a boat shape
[128 - 131] and if you want to make a paper boat
[131 - 134] make a paper boat call it paper boat say
[134 - 136] that's paper foam instead of paper paper
[136 - 142] boat paper paper boat and it also
[142 - 144] doubles up a third thing you put out
[144 - 149] just fold in one of the corners
[149 - 161] I guess corner pieces you fill it with
[161 - 165] water and they have a nice cup which

[169 - 172] or you can just dry out on a writer if
[173 - 174] you that sort of money and you need
[174 - 178] paper cups all right well that's a nice
[178 - 185] free in one how to paper session there
[185 - 187] you go thank you very much for watching
[187 - 191] please subscribe or leave a like if you
[191 - 194] want okay thank you very much

- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:

    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[11 - 11] you can use the technique I'm going to
[11 - 15] show you to make a top hat of any size I
[15 - 19] used a cardboard tube but you can use
[19 - 23] construction paper our poster board are
[23 - 26] any material that is stiff enough now I
[26 - 31] started by drawing around the cardboard
[31 - 38] tube at the bottom then I added some
[38 - 44] tabs so that I can glue it onto the two
[44 - 53] after I cut it out it looks like this i
[66 - 66] i glue them on first so later I can
[66 - 71] cover up the tabs takes a few minutes
[71 - 81] sometimes for the glue to dry
[84 - 84] and while we're waiting for that I drew
[84 - 87] around the bottom the same way i placed
[87 - 93] the tube and it's drew a circle around
[93 - 98] it then for the brim I drew a bigger
[98 - 108] circle around that
[111 - 111] and I cut the circle out and in the
[111 - 116] middle I just made a big X I'll show you
[116 - 121] I made a big X like this and I cut on
[121 - 126] those lines so that it looks like that
[126 - 132] did I bending up and the glue goes on
[132 - 140] the inside of these little triangles so
[140 - 143] that you can I mean I'm sorry little bit
[143 - 147] outside because they're going to be
[147 - 153] placed on the inside of the tube put
[153 - 158] those in take your finger and press them
[158 - 164] so that they blew on then the next thing
[164 - 169] idea that I measured this the tube and I
[169 - 172] r is a paper around it to cover it up
[172 - 176] next I cut the little band and it's just
[176 - 178] a little rectangle and you can make it
[178 - 180] as wide or as narrow as you want and
[180 - 184] then I cut strips to make the stripes
[184 - 187] and I put those on before I glued the
[187 - 190] bad don't and i added stars and glitter
[190 - 193] you may not want to but it's up to you
[193 - 195] it sure as you can make it any way you
[195 - 198] want now thanks for watching remember
[198 - 201] always be kind and please click the
[201 - 204] subscribe button    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Materials (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- If the speaker names or focuses on the paper/newspaper used for the hat, label as Paper.
- If the speaker discusses paint, brushes, tempera, or paint application, label as Paint.
- If the speaker mentions kitchen towels, paper towel strips, or absorbent base layers, label as Towel.
- If the speaker discusses tape, staples, yarn, or other fastening materials, label as Fastener.
- If the speaker refers to decorative accessories, kits, veils, stickers, or toppers, label as Accessory.
- When multiple materials are mentioned, choose the one that is the object being acted on or whose properties are being described.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[2 - 2] hi guys welcome back to origami twist my
[2 - 6] name is Jenna and today's video is one
[6 - 10] that is meant for all of those people
[10 - 13] who have been dealing with snow days and
[13 - 16] born children as a result of the snow
[16 - 19] days now as you probably know I live in
[19 - 21] Australia but I am from the northeastern
[21 - 24] part of the United States and boy oh boy
[24 - 26] have you guys had some weather recently
[26 - 30] whoa Facebook was literally blowing up
[30 - 32] with oh no not another snow day we're
[32 - 34] gonna be going to school in July at this
[34 - 37] rate right oh it's horrible but if
[37 - 40] you've got young children and they're
[40 - 42] stuck inside all day hopefully you got
[42 - 45] up to play in the snow but this
[45 - 47] particular project is great for
[47 - 51] imagination and playing dress-up and
[51 - 53] coming up with stories and ideas and
[53 - 56] basically kicking the kids out of
[56 - 58] boredom and you don't have to be in a
[58 - 62] snow snowy area of the world in order to
[62 - 65] do it it is the classic newspaper paper
[66 - 69] hat so yes you probably already have all
[69 - 70] the materials necessary to make this
[70 - 74] project and say all you need again one
[74 - 77] sheet of newspaper and let's get started
[77 - 82] so I have a what appears to be like a
[82 - 86] half size newspaper and if you've got
[86 - 87] one of those big ones just fold it in
[87 - 88] half and then fold it in half again
[88 - 91] until you have this rectangle about this
[91 - 94] size then the rest of it is really
[94 - 96] really easy you're just gonna fold one
[96 - 100] corner in to make a right triangle there
[101 - 104] you go and you're folding at the middle
[104 - 106] and then you're going to fold the other
[106 - 109] corner in to make another right triangle
[109 - 113] again folding down in the middle so
[113 - 114] you'll have a long skinny strip down
[114 - 118] here and two triangles up top you're
[118 - 120] going to fold this flap up it onto
[120 - 121] itself
[121 - 124] okay let's see how I folded it up onto
[124 - 126] itself to meet the bottom of those
[126 - 130] triangles and then you just fold it up
[130 - 134] again okay now you're going to turn it
[134 - 136] around and do the same thing you're
[136 - 139] gonna fold that bottom flap up so that
[139 - 142] it meets roughly at this point at the
[142 - 145] bottom of the triangle and you should be
[145 - 148] able to tell where that bottom is just
[148 - 150] by looking at the other side so just
[150 - 152] guess it's very rough it doesn't have to
[152 - 154] be perfect and then you're gonna fold
[154 - 158] that rectangle up again so that it
[158 - 161] matches the other side now all that you
[161 - 165] need to do at this stage is open it up
[165 - 169] and as you can see it creates what
[169 - 171] appears to be like a captain's hat
[171 - 173] now I'm sorry I haven't been looking at
[173 - 174] you this whole time I'm trying to see
[174 - 176] myself in the screen I'm not used to
[176 - 177] doing tutorials this way so thank you
[177 - 180] for bearing with me and without further
[180 - 186] ado that's it okay
[186 - 188] now I've got another couple of videos
[188 - 191] that work great with this it's called
[191 - 194] the captain's shirt story it uses this
[194 - 196] as a base and then it turns into a
[196 - 198] really neat interesting story so if
[198 - 200] you're interested in going a bit further
[200 - 202] with this fold let me know in the
[202 - 204] comments below and I'll make videos for
[204 - 208] that so in the comments below yes please
[208 - 211] on the captain's shirt story or whatever
[211 - 213] you know you'd like to put down there
[213 - 215] and thank you so much for watching
[215 - 218] please subscribe if you enjoy paper
[218 - 221] crafting and that sort of thing and I
[221 - 234] hope you guys have a fabulous day bye

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[18 - 18] okay hi guys today we're going to make a
[18 - 22] Mother's Day hat for you and it's for
[22 - 24] Mother's Day coming up on Sunday we're
[24 - 26] gonna have a little Mother's Day Tea
[26 - 28] Party for Jillian's preschool tomorrow
[28 - 31] so we're doing this in preparation for
[31 - 34] that for all the moms in her preschool
[34 - 37] see so it looks really cute on this is
[37 - 40] the finished product and all the moms
[40 - 42] I'm happy to wear it tomorrow so here we
[42 - 44] go so the things that you're going to
[44 - 48] need is one large piece of butcher paper
[48 - 51] or newsprint will work too and then
[51 - 54] you're going to need two sized bowls one
[54 - 58] larger than the other and so two bowls
[58 - 63] scissors stapler really just stapler and
[63 - 68] some tape okay so let's get started so
[68 - 70] first you start off by forming the Hat
[70 - 72] so you need a mold and that's what the
[72 - 74] bowls are going to do I'm going to put
[74 - 76] the bowl underneath the smaller bowl
[76 - 80] goes underneath the paper okay right in
[80 - 82] the center and then Julian can you help
[82 - 86] switch down the paper a little bit okay
[86 - 89] there you go so then you're going to
[89 - 93] place the larger bowl on top
[97 - 97] put your hand up go ahead and push down
[97 - 103] the bolt and that's the uniform that the
[103 - 106] top with the Hat and you kind of just
[106 - 107] spread off the paper
[107 - 110] give me a lot of folding and cutting
[110 - 115] involved with this and stately okay this
[115 - 118] is just getting the shape of the Hat
[118 - 120] once that's down secure then you can
[120 - 127] lift it up there's the top of the half a
[134 - 134] little Bowl still there okay let's put
[134 - 136] it back we don't want to lose our shape
[136 - 138] here so the next thing I'm going to do
[138 - 140] is to secure the shape we're going to
[140 - 142] use some masking tape okay
[142 - 144] so Jillian why don't you hold down this
[144 - 150] paper you hold the top and we're going
[150 - 153] to start just circling around the Hat
[153 - 160] with the tape kind of press it down as
[160 - 168] you go
[173 - 173] good job Jill and then we're gonna have
[173 - 181] to measure it to see if it fits
[185 - 185] okay it's a little bit big so you can
[185 - 190] take it in by folding it a little bit so
[190 - 191] if it's a little big you can just kind
[191 - 196] of fold it over a little bit what we're
[196 - 200] going to do the rim in a second okay and
[200 - 203] then just use some more tape I like to
[203 - 206] put a second row tape on just to make it
[206 - 215] really secure since the paper is very
[215 - 219] large I'm going to trim the edges so we
[219 - 222] have less paper to work with I'm just
[222 - 224] going to go around and trim it kind of
[224 - 230] in a circle okay so now this is the fun
[230 - 233] part with the kids you'll get to make
[233 - 236] the brim of the Hat just like this so it
[236 - 238] has a little brim all around the sides
[238 - 241] make it finished and look nice so what
[241 - 242] they're going to do is just fold around
[242 - 246] and go all the way around okay go ahead
[246 - 246] Jo
[246 - 254] keep folding it up go and turning it and
[254 - 257] kind of go along after them and press it
[257 - 265] down press it down right there you go
[269 - 269] and then I'm going to go around behind
[269 - 272] her and staple it to secure it and it
[272 - 283] doesn't have to be even lots of muscles
[283 - 287] then there's your undecorated hat ready
[287 - 296] to go let's see okay so we're done with
[296 - 299] the hats the only thing left to do is to
[299 - 301] paint them and make them colorful so
[301 - 302] tomorrow we're going to paint them with
[302 - 305] their preschool class and it should be a
[305 - 308] lot of fun right okay so see you

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[7 - 7] Winston you want to show everyone how to
[7 - 11] make a nurse hat no you want to play
[11 - 14] with the container camera okay so today
[14 - 15] I'm going to show you how to make a
[15 - 17] really cute little nurse hat I made
[17 - 19] these for my friend's bachelorette party
[19 - 22] and it was super fun and super easy so
[22 - 24] you start off with for you
[24 - 30] square square my square is I don't know
[30 - 33] I just kind of estimated 21 and a half
[33 - 38] centimeters or eight inches or something
[38 - 39] like that
[39 - 41] eight and a half inches it's a square so
[41 - 44] both sides are the same length okay then
[44 - 47] the top of my square I cut two slits
[47 - 50] again I just kind of estimating it's not
[50 - 53] being a very good in the crafter so it's
[53 - 58] like three inches about or seven
[58 - 61] centimeters obviously it's not super
[61 - 62] duper important how big it is because I
[62 - 64] just asked me to indicate myself anyways
[64 - 66] okay so you have your three slits cut
[66 - 69] with scissors you're going to take these
[69 - 72] two you're going to fold them so that
[72 - 79] they match see the edges match nicely
[79 - 85] and I just use tape this is I just made
[85 - 87] it not too hard because I had to make
[87 - 91] like 15 of them or something so that was
[91 - 96] that once it steeps kind of flaxen edge
[96 - 98] hold the edges now I have a shape like
[98 - 102] this lovely pink then you take the top
[102 - 106] part and fold it over the other two
[106 - 110] parts Erin you take your tape and you do
[110 - 114] the same thing tape fix hold on your
[114 - 118] tape a bit now you have a sheet like
[118 - 122] this
[125 - 125] very good I stuff a little flat cross on
[125 - 128] the top then you're going to look at it
[128 - 131] and you have this big thing so I pulled
[131 - 137] it and folded it again so now I know
[137 - 139] exactly how my nurse hat is going to
[139 - 142] look fake it so just so it has those
[142 - 145] things there then I just kind of need
[145 - 150] little folds on the sides of it when you
[150 - 154] put it on your head it's going to sit
[154 - 156] like a little cap so just trying to bend
[156 - 158] the edges a little bit so see how it
[158 - 161] makes kind of a little pact once you
[161 - 163] have your little edges in then you can
[163 - 170] go ahead and fold your thing back up a
[170 - 176] little bit nurse hat so cute these fit
[177 - 178] on our heads really really well and all
[178 - 180] we did was just stick some bobby pins in
[180 - 181] the back
[181 - 183] JooJoo and they stayed in our head
[183 - 185] really really well if you want to go a
[185 - 187] little bit further you can take some of
[187 - 190] this stuff hmm I chose black before a
[190 - 196] bride we had white and I'm super lazy
[196 - 198] and don't have a lot of crafting
[198 - 203] materials I just used regular tape put
[203 - 207] it on my sail material and dock it in
[207 - 211] the back so it would come out of the
[211 - 213] back of our thing and I put a few layers
[213 - 216] that are always anyway so that's how we
[216 - 217] run around the what the bride had a
[217 - 220] black hat and had a white veil and it
[220 - 222] was super funny and cute and easy and
[222 - 224] everyone loves them
[224 - 227] isn't that right Winston everyone loved
[227 - 235] them even rinsed
[239 - 239] there you go do you like that book no

- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[8 - 9] hey guys bill here and today we're going
[9 - 11] to be making paper hats and I've already
[11 - 14] made one if you want to take a look this
[14 - 16] is what it should and look like a themed
[16 - 20] so I'm going to do it step by step so
[20 - 23] you can use any type of paper you want
[23 - 25] wake up use your newspaper for now i
[25 - 28] would first thing you need to do is to
[28 - 33] make sure that it's amble flat on the
[33 - 37] edges especially even and definitely on
[37 - 39] this side you don't it all like bumpy
[39 - 44] and you do the heart so that's how flat
[44 - 46] it should be and then you want to fold
[46 - 49] it in half again so we fold it like this
[49 - 52] you need to fold it so it's perfectly
[52 - 56] not off the edge so I need to do it like
[56 - 59] that now we have to make sure it's
[59 - 64] flutters down like that playgirl press
[64 - 67] and all the rest out and that's the
[67 - 69] second part and now we need to fold it
[69 - 73] back out to get that was just to give us
[73 - 75] 10 tonight page so now we need to fold
[75 - 78] this part of the paper we just go like
[78 - 80] this we need to make sure it's right on
[80 - 83] the middle right on target that make
[83 - 87] sure top right just like that I mean
[87 - 91] lots of the flowers much as we can there
[91 - 94] we go so you have to do it to the crease
[94 - 96] in the middle that's what the creased is
[96 - 98] fought and now we have to do it to this
[98 - 101] side now straight to the middle make

[112 - 115] you need that bottom part there and then
[115 - 121] you just phone it to where that is there
[121 - 125] then you have to flatten it down make
[125 - 127] sure the triangles stay down so now we
[127 - 131] have to fold this part or so you get the
[131 - 133] side of the half to make sure perfectly
[133 - 138] flat now we do the opposite side exactly
[138 - 142] the same that's why we have the need the
[142 - 146] this side so we go to the other side and
[146 - 151] fold it half here just make sure
[151 - 155] straight there and then fall it again

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] today we're going to make hats oh did
[3 - 5] you see I took off my hat
[5 - 6] that's right take off your hat it'll
[6 - 8] take my dog we're gonna make hats out of
[8 - 12] newspaper and for this all you need is
[12 - 14] newspaper so I'll take one of these one
[14 - 16] sheet while you're there so what do we
[16 - 19] read in today no no no we're just not
[19 - 21] reading we're making hats we're making
[21 - 24] hat so all right so normally a newspaper
[24 - 26] is already folded so we can already
[26 - 27] leave that folded right there
[27 - 29] great just like this and we're going to
[29 - 31] take that and we're going to you know
[31 - 33] they say what did they say when when
[33 - 35] you're folding it there's hot dog and
[35 - 37] hamburger is that right so that's ham
[37 - 40] hamburger is a cross you know so you
[40 - 42] have a wider one and then hotdog would
[42 - 44] be the thinner one right yep
[44 - 46] so what we want to do is we want to give
[46 - 49] one fold in half hamburger style number
[49 - 52] seven all right so then we're making a
[52 - 55] crease right down the middle of it it
[55 - 56] doesn't even it doesn't have to be
[56 - 58] perfect that pair of nothing has to be
[58 - 61] right so now we have a nice crease right
[61 - 63] there right in the middle and now we're
[63 - 66] going to make we're going to fold the
[66 - 68] corners the top two corners where the
[68 - 71] fold is you see that there's already
[71 - 72] pulled down we're going to fold those
[72 - 75] corners in at the half
[75 - 78] like right along that crease so there's
[78 - 81] one side you see and then here's the
[81 - 83] other side and we'll both do them on the
[83 - 89] same same side here so now what you have
[89 - 93] should look like this that's what you
[93 - 95] should be seeing and this should be kind
[95 - 97] of open on the bottom right did you have
[97 - 99] a couple scoops oh how you doing there
[99 - 101] Brian I think I'm doing pretty well
[101 - 105] all right good so now the next step is
[105 - 107] that we're going to see yeah the bottom
[107 - 109] edge around here right here and you see
[109 - 111] how you have two sheets it looks like
[111 - 113] you have two sheets of paper there
[113 - 115] together for we're going to fold the
[115 - 118] first sheet of paper up so just one yeah
[118 - 120] and it's kind of like I guess hot dog
[120 - 123] style you're gonna pull it right all the
[123 - 125] way up make it so it looks like this
[125 - 128] right yeah that's right it's a nice
[128 - 130] thick creaser so then so this is what
[130 - 132] that side should look like is that you
[132 - 134] folded right along this
[134 - 138] were those two triangles where those two
[138 - 140] corners came in and you fold it right up
[140 - 143] along here okay so now you're gonna flip
[143 - 147] it over so you see just the back back
[147 - 150] and now this is where we're gonna size
[150 - 152] it now I have a really big head so I'm
[152 - 155] only gonna do small yeah so I'm gonna
[155 - 158] make I'll make a smaller hat for the
[158 - 159] people on the internet because they
[159 - 160] probably don't have as big a head as I
[160 - 162] do and then you're trying to make a big
[162 - 164] hat so they could fit around your food
[164 - 166] around my head so what what we do here
[166 - 170] is we take these sides the whole side
[170 - 172] right here and we fold it in so here's
[172 - 174] one side we're gonna fold this in you
[174 - 177] know we're Emison as much as our much so
[177 - 180] if you have like a smaller head you can
[180 - 183] fold it in like you know a couple three
[183 - 186] inches right there but if you have a
[186 - 188] bigger head like me you can fold it in
[188 - 191] fold it in just a little bit like that
[191 - 193] now do the same on the other side fold
[193 - 198] it up and in like that make a nice
[198 - 200] little crease so now if you're holding
[200 - 202] them because they're gonna try to flap
[202 - 203] out they look like this so this is what
[203 - 207] your back should look like and then just
[207 - 209] like on the front side you're going to
[209 - 212] fold this right up fold this bottom edge
[212 - 215] right up so now it's all and not on the
[215 - 217] same size but on the opposite so on the
[217 - 219] opposite side so now you'll still have
[219 - 221] that little space right in the middle
[221 - 224] and that's a base that your head goes no
[224 - 228] if you start popping it out a little bit

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] hey everybody this is gonna be a
[2 - 5] tutorial on how to make a paper hat so
[5 - 7] the first step is you want to draw three
[7 - 10] shapes that look like this now the first
[10 - 13] shape you draw is gonna have a curve
[13 - 16] right there and then the second one is
[16 - 19] gonna be a little bit less curved but a
[19 - 21] slant going up there but a small slit
[21 - 23] and then the third is going to be the
[23 - 25] smallest piece and the less curved on
[25 - 27] the edge once you have this drawing out
[27 - 28] what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut
[28 - 31] each one out after you cut them out
[31 - 32] you're gonna have three of these and
[32 - 35] you're gonna take one of them put them
[35 - 37] on a white piece of paper and trace
[37 - 39] around because what you're doing is
[39 - 41] you're you're making two of each shape
[41 - 43] and so you're making sure that each one
[43 - 45] is the same size as the one before
[45 - 47] because if it's not the hats not gonna
[47 - 54] fit together correctly and once you have
[54 - 56] all those traced what you're gonna do is
[56 - 58] take some scissors and you're gonna cut
[58 - 63] each one out this is the time to color
[63 - 66] them and if you want to once you have
[66 - 67] them all cut out what you're gonna do is
[67 - 69] you're gonna take one of them and you're
[69 - 71] gonna draw lines like this around the
[71 - 73] edge these represent the seams of the
[73 - 76] Hat and if you want to you can also do a
[76 - 79] dotted line for these instead but you
[79 - 82] can do it however you want and you're
[82 - 88] gonna do that for every single one
[90 - 90] make sure that for these pieces the two
[90 - 92] largest ones the slant is going down on
[92 - 94] that side and going up on that one it's
[94 - 98] almost like a mirror image once you have
[98 - 100] them all drawn on what you're gonna do
[100 - 103] is you're gonna take these to make sure
[103 - 105] it's those two take a piece of tape tape
[105 - 107] on the back and then you're gonna put
[107 - 109] together you are now starting to put the
[109 - 115] Hat together take another piece of tape
[115 - 117] and put it on the back and put them
[117 - 119] together you're gonna be doing this for
[119 - 122] each one just make sure that you don't
[122 - 124] tape too close to the top because when
[124 - 126] you're done sometimes it doesn't fit
[126 - 129] together quite right so you want to make
[129 - 130] sure you have enough room if you need to
[130 - 133] adjust now the next two pieces is you
[133 - 136] want to put ones of the smallest ones on
[136 - 138] one side and the other smallest piece on
[138 - 141] the other side each side has to be
[141 - 142] symmetrical because if you don't put
[142 - 144] them in to get together in the right
[144 - 145] order the hats not going to come out
[145 - 147] right so you have to make sure you're
[147 - 151] doing it in this order and then take
[151 - 154] that other small piece and attach it to
[154 - 173] the other side like that
[175 - 175] now for the two largest pieces which are
[175 - 176] the two lost you have to be careful
[176 - 179] about this make sure that the slants on
[179 - 181] this are going kind of in the mirror
[181 - 184] image again going opposite but then
[184 - 185] after that you just do what you've been
[185 - 187] doing the whole time taping on the back
[187 - 191] and then putting together like this just
[191 - 193] like that just make sure that the slants
[193 - 201] are going the opposite direction
[204 - 204] these two last pieces are usually the
[204 - 206] most difficult to put together because
[206 - 207] everything is a little bit crowded
[207 - 210] because it's making the circular shape
[210 - 214] so it may be a little bit difficult in
[214 - 216] the video you can tell that I'm gonna
[216 - 219] have a little bit of trouble with it but
[219 - 221] it seemed pretty easy to work around but
[221 - 225] just keep taping to the back and then
[225 - 231] putting it together like that and if you
[231 - 233] have a gap at the top that's completely
[233 - 235] fine or if you have a little bit of tape
[235 - 241] left over there don't worry about it and
[241 - 243] if you do have any extra tape up there
[243 - 245] what you can do is just take some
[245 - 247] scissors and cut off the extra tape and
[247 - 248] don't worry about that gap at the top
[248 - 252] because that's gonna be covered up later
[252 - 254] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[254 - 256] take some cardboard make sure it's thin
[256 - 257] cardboard you can use anything you want
[257 - 259] as you can see here I use some Ritz
[259 - 262] cardboard so you can do anything you
[262 - 269] really want make about six tabs like
[269 - 272] that you you actually really only need
[272 - 277] four but um I'm just doing that in case
[277 - 279] I mess out so then take some tape you
[279 - 281] can bend it too it might make it easier
[281 - 283] and then put it in like that and just
[283 - 287] keep taping around the entire hat this
[287 - 288] is to make the Hat more sturdy and it
[288 - 292] also gives the Hat the round shape so
[292 - 294] that if you wear it it won't crumble or
[294 - 297] anything when you put it on and so just
[297 - 299] keep taping around the top and bottom
[299 - 300] make sure they're on there correctly
[300 - 303] make sure they won't fall off and you
[303 - 305] may notice you can see through the white
[305 - 307] hat to the cardboard but that's fine if
[307 - 309] you have your head actually colored in
[309 - 311] right now you um you probably can't even
[311 - 315] see it so it's fine now what you're
[315 - 317] gonna do is you're gonna make the brim
[317 - 319] for that so put the Hat down like that
[319 - 322] and you're gonna make kind of a half
[322 - 328] circle like this yeah and kind of draw
[328 - 331] it in lightly in case you mess up so you
[331 - 333] can erase it and there won't be any left
[333 - 334] over
[334 - 338] marks and once you have it right or how
[338 - 341] you like it just go around and darken it
[341 - 345] back in like that and then put the hat
[346 - 348] back on and you're just gonna make a
[348 - 351] half circle around the edges like this
[351 - 357] and by now which it look like a half
[357 - 361] moon and then just darken it in and then
[361 - 364] once you have it all darken in you're
[364 - 367] gonna cut it out with some scissors and
[367 - 370] this is when you can color the Birman if
[370 - 373] you want to now what we're gonna do is
[373 - 376] you're gonna take some pencil and you're
[376 - 378] gonna draw some lines like this these
[378 - 383] represent the seams of the brim so just
[383 - 389] draw it around like that you can also do
[389 - 392] these dotted lines here instead if you
[392 - 395] want but you can do it any way and just
[395 - 398] keep doing that but before you get to
[398 - 401] the very end about this point stop and
[401 - 406] just leave that area blank in there now
[406 - 407] you're gonna take some cardboard and
[407 - 412] you're gonna trace around the paper it's
[412 - 414] okay if the cardboard is a little bit
[414 - 417] too small as you can see here I have him
[417 - 418] used a little bit too small a piece but
[418 - 420] it's fine just make sure it's not too
[420 - 422] small and then you're gonna cut it out
[422 - 425] because this is gonna make the brim more
[425 - 428] stiff
[430 - 430] and then you're gonna take some glue
[430 - 433] glue the cardboard and then you're just
[433 - 437] gonna put the brim the paper broom onto
[437 - 443] the cardboard
[446 - 446] once you're done with that you can flip
[446 - 449] it over and if you have any writing like
[449 - 453] here and writing like that what you do
[453 - 457] is you trace around and then you cut
[457 - 459] that out and then you're just gonna put
[459 - 460] it over the words or whatever there is
[460 - 462] there so you don't see it and then put
[462 - 464] it down like that and if you can still
[464 - 466] see through you just do it again
[466 - 469] and then you won't be able to see it now
[469 - 470] what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[470 - 473] make sure that shape is the same shape
[473 - 475] you see on the Hat it has to be that
[475 - 478] shape because that's the front tape the
[478 - 487] brim put a few pieces on and tape it to
[487 - 490] the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on
[490 - 499] straight
[502 - 502] now you're gonna fill that gap in so
[502 - 505] take some paper cut out a square
[505 - 511] rectangular shape and you're gonna glue
[511 - 520] the inside of the Hat like this
[523 - 523] and then Pat that down inside and then
[523 - 533] you can't see through anymore like that
[536 - 536] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
[536 - 538] make the airholes for that so take some
[538 - 541] paper and draw six circles and put dark
[541 - 545] dots in the middle of each one and then
[545 - 552] cut them out
[554 - 554] once you have them all cut out take some
[554 - 557] glue glue the bottom of them and paste
[557 - 574] them on in these areas on the Hat
[577 - 577] now we're gonna make the very top of the
[577 - 581] Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a
[581 - 584] strip about this big I actually think I
[584 - 587] made it a little bit too long take some
[587 - 590] glue glue the end and make a circle
[590 - 593] shape about this size and glue both ends
[593 - 600] together once you have that done take a
[600 - 602] piece of paper cut out a circle about
[602 - 609] this big take the other piece glue the
[609 - 614] bottom put that on top and then once you
[614 - 619] get that on glue the other side you
[619 - 620] might want to use a little bit more glue
[620 - 622] than I did here and then put that on the
[622 - 627] top right there now this is the point
[627 - 630] when you can put logos on here here here
[630 - 633] I used EC and a bunch of them but you
[633 - 635] can do anything you want and also you
[635 - 637] can go online print this sticker off
[637 - 641] glue the back and put it on the brim to
[641 - 644] give it a more realistic look and there
[644 - 647] you go there's your hat if you have any
[647 - 649] questions you can message me and I'll
[649 - 652] answer anything if you want you can also
[652 - 654] put your video of your hat as a video
[654 - 657] response to this I'd love to see it good
[657 - 659] luck    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[3 - 3] hello and welcome to tutti frutti my
[3 - 4] name is Anita and today I'm going to
[4 - 7] show you how to make a paper hat for
[7 - 10] your Christmas cracker for this you're
[10 - 13] going to use some tissue paper a ruler a
[13 - 17] pencil some glue and some scissors I'm
[17 - 20] using a twenty by thirty inch piece of
[20 - 23] paper and I'm going to fold it into four
[23 - 26] making four hats let's speed this up a

[38 - 41] to measure 24 inches along the paper and
[41 - 45] then cut just over that so now we're
[45 - 47] going to fold it into three and then
[47 - 49] we're going to cut off the top and the
[49 - 52] bottom so that there we have four
[52 - 58] separate hats
[61 - 61] now we're going to cut a triangle in the
[61 - 74] top followed by half a triangle

[78 - 81] watching    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[3 - 3] I'm going to show you how to make this
[3 - 6] fun bowlers hat for Saint Patrick's Day
[6 - 8] or any other occasion for which you
[8 - 10] would need a bowlers hat the first thing
[10 - 11] you're going to need is your newspaper
[11 - 14] base that's done with one that has a
[14 - 17] deep Bowl for the Hat put it out on the
[18 - 20] table you get it as flat as you can
[20 - 23] around the edges and once you have that
[23 - 25] done you're simply going to start
[25 - 29] rolling the edges up and just gonna roll
[29 - 33] all the way around because you're kind
[33 - 36] of preparing this newspaper to be your
[36 - 39] bowlers hat once you've gone around the
[39 - 44] first time go ahead and start taping it
[44 - 47] all the way around you might have to
[47 - 49] take fairly often but you might not it
[49 - 52] depends on your newspaper once you've
[52 - 53] gotten your hat to the point where you
[53 - 57] taped it all up you can look at it and
[57 - 61] see if it's in as close as you want and
[61 - 65] has that bowler hat look to it once you
[65 - 68] have done that you're going to want to
[68 - 71] take tempera paint or any other paint I
[71 - 73] took this tempered paint put it in a big
[73 - 76] paper plate and use the large brush to
[76 - 79] paint the whole hat newspaper is very
[79 - 81] thin paper and it takes a long time to
[81 - 83] dry so you want to make sure your hat is
[83 - 85] completely dry before you start
[85 - 87] decorating it but in the meantime you
[87 - 89] can cut out what you're going to use to
[89 - 94] make your decorations I use simply three
[94 - 96] hearts that I cut out of construction
[96 - 101] paper and I made them the same size so I
[101 - 105] use the first one as a template cut the
[105 - 116] second one and cut the third one
[122 - 122] and for these I covered them with
[122 - 126] Elmer's glue and then I sprinkled green
[126 - 131] glitter on them and let it dry and once
[131 - 135] that was done I put them together three
[135 - 137] hearts with a little dab of glue I'll
[137 - 138] put a little piece of tape that'll give
[138 - 143] you the idea and my shamrock was ready
[143 - 146] to go from my bowlers hat then once my
[146 - 149] hat was dry I started making that other
[149 - 152] decorations for it no there's your
[152 - 154] shamrock to go in the middle of your hat
[154 - 159] I used shamrock confetti and I used
[159 - 163] glitter glue and I just made some
[163 - 165] decorations around the brim of the Hat
[165 - 169] took my Elmer's glue and put on the
[169 - 171] confetti and glued the shamrock to the
[171 - 173] middle with a little piece of confetti
[173 - 175] now you can of course make a bowlers hat
[175 - 178] any color for any occasion but this is
[178 - 183] how I made a st. Patrick's Day bowler
[183 - 187] hat out of newspaper

[2 - 2] hi this is Ginny with simply beautiful
[2 - 4] crafts on behalf of expert village and
[4 - 8] we're going to make party hats this very
[8 - 10] fun party hat is made out of only three
[10 - 13] pieces of construction paper this is the
[13 - 15] smaller paper the first thing you want
[15 - 21] to do is take the smaller paper and just
[21 - 26] wrap it around your head until it fits
[26 - 32] and tape or staple it nothing to it
[32 - 37] really once you have your hat secured
[37 - 39] might want to take a special pair of
[39 - 42] scissors but the fancy edges and cut
[42 - 44] around the edge so that you have an edge
[44 - 47] that looks like this and you know if you
[47 - 49] don't have the fancy scissors to do this
[49 - 51] kind of an edge you can always just tear
[51 - 54] the paper and that too will give you a
[54 - 57] fancy edge now one thing that you can do
[57 - 60] too before you even cut out your hat
[60 - 63] before you staple it is to leave it open
[63 - 66] and decorate it you might want to write
[66 - 70] happy birthday and crayon or use markers
[70 - 73] or even use glitter and glue once you've
[73 - 75] done that you put your hat together and
[75 - 78] then you want to make this this is the
[78 - 82] fun stuff and it's so easy to make cut
[82 - 84] out a variety of sizes and colors of
[84 - 87] circles and then just start cutting out
[87 - 89] your circle you want to stay fairly
[89 - 92] close to the edge but it does not have
[92 - 95] to be even that's the beauty of it and
[95 - 97] you just keep cutting until you keep
[97 - 101] Spile spiraling around and you have it
[101 - 103] looking like this and then you take the
[103 - 109] center and stretch it as you can see I
[109 - 111] used several pieces of yellow and
[111 - 114] several pieces of purple I started out
[114 - 116] with a large circle with the purple and
[116 - 119] this was a small circle with the yellow
[119 - 122] put them all together staple them at the
[122 - 128] top shook them out and here we go a
[128 - 131] really fun crazy
[131 - 134] happy birthday hat it would work for new
[134 - 136] to    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[11 - 13] going to make a very simple pirate hat
[13 - 17] out of a newspaper you know went three
[17 - 19] sheets of newspaper you can use two but
[19 - 22] three sheets gives you a more sturdy hat
[22 - 25] that are two-sided all the way no half
[25 - 27] sheets lay it out in front of you
[27 - 31] sideways with your fold at the front and
[31 - 34] you're going to find the middle and then
[34 - 39] fold it down to the middle not quite
[39 - 43] centered up and down again leaving a
[43 - 45] little bit of space at the top so that
[45 - 48] it's even and then you're simply going
[48 - 52] to take the first three sheets one two
[52 - 64] three and fold them up and crease it
[66 - 66] [Applause]

[70 - 75] sheets and then fasten it I put mine on
[75 - 79] my head and then stapled it right at the

[81 - 85] on my head and fit you can do that with
[85 - 90] your hat too now you have your base for
[90 - 95] your pirate hat and what I did with mine
[95 - 100] was to use black construction paper to
[100 - 102] cover the front of it but you could also
[102 - 104] use black tempera paint and I stuck it
[104 - 107] down in the Hat band and then I made a
[107 - 110] skull and crossbones and glued it on
[110 - 112] you're going to make a skull and
[112 - 115] crossbones basically you want to make
[115 - 124] kind of a light bulb shape and put the
[124 - 127] two circles for the eyes you're going to
[127 - 130] have your teeth come down again kind of
[130 - 135] to a point and have teeth and your nose

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[21 - 21] decorate your mash a pirate ship using
[21 - 23] acrylic paint you can have lots of fun
[23 - 25] coming up with a really piratey color
[25 - 32] scheme
[36 - 36] the next step is to fold your card in
[36 - 39] half this is going to create the larger
[39 - 42] waves to go around the outside of your
[42 - 45] hat fold it in half and then we're going
[45 - 60] to draw the wave shape along the paper
[63 - 63] this time to make the smaller waves fold
[63 - 66] your paper in half along the long side
[66 - 78] of the paper and then fold it again
[81 - 81] so you'll find this is slightly more
[81 - 83] difficult to cut through because there's
[83 - 87] four layers of card to cut through so
[87 - 88] you may have to be a bit tougher with
[88 - 92] your scissors but it's well worth it
[92 - 94] because the effect is fantastic at the
[94 - 97] end cut the leaves down the center along
[97 - 106] the fold
[108 - 108] if you have a little extra on the bottom
[108 - 110] you could always just sand that off
[110 - 113] using your glue gun run a line of glue
[113 - 119] along the bottom of your boat and then
[119 - 124] securely attaches to the Hat you'll need
[124 - 125] to hold this in place for a few minutes
[125 - 129] just so it sticks securely so it doesn't
[129 - 130] matter if it's completely straight
[130 - 132] because waves are choppy so it just adds
[132 - 135] to the sea effect next we're going to
[135 - 137] attach the waves to the Hat I'm going to
[137 - 139] use a glue gun but you could use a
[139 - 143] stapler Sini's stick lots of glue onto
[143 - 148] your waves and mold it to the shape of
[148 - 153] the Hat holding it firmly you might need
[153 - 156] to cut your waves to size so it fits
[156 - 163] around the Hat it doesn't matter if it
[163 - 165] overlaps a little bit because the other
[165 - 166] waves are going to go around the edge
[166 - 169] next we're going to attach our smaller
[169 - 174] waves around the edge of the Hat we're
[174 - 175] going to use exactly the same processes
[175 - 180] the larger waves gluing just over the
[180 - 185] top to give this layered effect you will
[185 - 187] need an adult's help with the glue gun
[187 - 189] because it does get very hot I'm going
[189 - 195] to add some treasure to my bonnet you
[195 - 196] can put it wherever you fancy so it
[196 - 199] could be around the boat or it could be
[199 - 200] at the bottom of the ocean it's
[200 - 204] completely up to you and firmly place
[204 - 208] the coins onto the Hat
[208 - 210] if you have any overlapping sections in
[210 - 212] your waves you could always put one of
[212 - 217] the coins over the top so when you stuck
[217 - 218] on your coins
[218 - 221] it obviously adds some sparkle to your
[221 - 228] hat we're going to add the bunting so

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[2 - 2] in this clip I'm going to show you how
[2 - 5] to make a paper top hat you're gonna
[5 - 8] take a piece of paper a paper plate here
[8 - 10] you can take your scissors and you're
[10 - 12] going to cut out the middle by carefully
[12 - 15] poking the scissors through the top and
[15 - 19] cutting leaving a little bit of the
[19 - 23] paper plate on the top and notice that I
[23 - 26] turned the paper plate over or upside
[26 - 31] down I quickly cut that out all the way
[31 - 34] around and then I'm going to take just a
[34 - 37] regular piece of construction paper and
[37 - 39] I'm going to fold down the top just a
[39 - 42] little bit to give it some sturdy nuts
[42 - 46] because I want it to really hold
[46 - 48] together well I'm gonna put a glue stick
[48 - 53] on here pull that down and then I'm
[53 - 56] going to also fold up the bottom about a
[56 - 58] half of an inch and this is going to
[58 - 65] allow the paper top-hat to fit inside of
[65 - 66] the paper plate and I'm going to cut
[66 - 69] little slits around here which will help
[69 - 75] mold it into a circle okay the last
[75 - 76] thing I want to do is I want to overlap
[76 - 78] these so I'm going to put a little bit
[78 - 80] of glue here and I'm going to go ahead
[80 - 87] and put these two together like that and
[87 - 91] there take a piece of tape and put this
[91 - 93] right in the middle where I'm
[93 - 96] overlapping it just to support it a
[96 - 98] little bit now I'm going to put this
[98 - 102] right inside of my paper plate and I'm
[102 - 104] going to turn it upside down and I'm
[104 - 108] going to start gluing these tabs onto
[108 - 112] the paper plate just like you see here
[112 - 115] and I'm going to go ahead and show you
[115 - 118] that this last one and I want to support
[118 - 122] it again with a piece of tape and the
[122 - 125] very last thing I'm going to do is I'm
[125 - 128] going to take my magic marker and I'm
[128 - 130] going to go ahead and make that brim
[130 - 135] black and you have a great top hat

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[3 - 3] hi in this video I'm going to show you
[3 - 6] how you can create an imaginative Easter
[6 - 8] bonnet with your child using simple
[8 - 12] paper mache techniques first of all you
[12 - 15] need a balloon if you're making
[15 - 17] something like this out of an egg shape
[17 - 20] or if you want to make an animal or a
[20 - 23] bird you'll need a small balloon for the
[23 - 26] head and a larger balloon for the body
[26 - 33] so first of all you need to inflate the
[33 - 36] large balloon sit it in a saucepan or
[36 - 40] bowl so it sits securely while you're
[40 - 44] applying the strips of newspaper I've
[44 - 48] cut mine into 1 by 5 inch strips but you
[48 - 50] don't have to be approximate that's only
[50 - 52] approximate you don't have to do it
[52 - 55] exactly the other thing you'll need is a
[55 - 58] pot of PVA glue which has some water in
[58 - 60] so it's running and you'll need a
[60 - 63] paintbrush and your meal apron that will
[63 - 65] cover your child because it can get
[65 - 69] messy so what I recommend is that you
[69 - 71] get your child to cover an area of the
[71 - 75] balloon with glue and I'll show you that
[75 - 79] it should just run on the balloon quite
[79 - 82] easily and then when you've covered an
[82 - 86] area the balloon in PVA close then apply
[86 - 89] strips running in the same direction all
[89 - 95] around the balloon then apply another
[95 - 98] another layer of glue put on the strip's
[98 - 101] going in the opposite direction
[101 - 103] overlapping slightly so there are no
[103 - 107] gaps and then your third layer will go
[108 - 110] back to the original direction and then
[110 - 112] I recommend that for the final layer you
[112 - 116] apply some kitchen towel strips or some
[116 - 118] paper to have strips and because this
[119 - 122] provides a really good base for
[122 - 126] painting it helps it make sure that the
[126 - 128] print doesn't show through or it
[128 - 130] provides a good base if you're wanting
[130 - 135] to put squares of tissue paper onto the
[135 - 139] balloon so after about 24 hours in a
[139 - 142] really warm place your balloon will
[142 - 146] hopefully dry so that it's it's it's
[146 - 154] very solid pop the balloon and cut up a
[154 - 157] circular hole in the bottom large enough
[157 - 161] for the top of the Hat it should should
[161 - 164] fit securely on and then if you're
[164 - 166] wanting to make an Easter basket like
[166 - 169] this all you have to do is is cut a
[169 - 173] section out of each side leaving a
[173 - 175] handle shape down the middle and then
[175 - 177] your child could fill it with things
[177 - 180] that they've made here I've got homemade
[180 - 184] daffodils and decoupage eggs and some
[184 - 187] tissue paper shred or if you're
[187 - 191] interested in making one of the animals
[191 - 197] then your your need and some tissue
[197 - 200] paper shred for their for their fur or
[200 - 204] for their coat now to help you to sit
[204 - 206] the head on top of the body what I
[206 - 209] recommend is that you have used some
[209 - 211] duct tape to make some crisscross shapes
[211 - 214] at the bottom of the head and stick that
[214 - 216] on top of the body so that it's secure
[216 - 218] because what you don't want is for the
[218 - 221] kids to fall off during the Easter
[221 - 228] bonnet parade at my website wwlp.com you
[228 - 230] there were three kits available there's
[230 - 233] a chick kit there's a rabbit kit and
[233 - 235] there's a lamb kit and
[236 - 238] come with all materials that you'll need
[238 - 241] to make an Easter bonnet as well as the
[241 - 244] bonnet and a list of instructions to
[244 - 246] help you go through it step by step but
[246 - 248] if you have any questions or any ideas
[248 - 250] that you want to discuss please get in
[250 - 254] touch thank you for watching    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[6 - 6] some of you might be wondering why I'm
[6 - 9] dressed up well it's my birthday happy
[9 - 15] birthday to me happy birthday to me
[15 - 22] happy birthday to that girl Tyson happy
[22 - 26] birthday to me that's right
[26 - 29] today is my birthday November 30th
[29 - 32] that is the day I was brought forth into
[32 - 34] this world which is also why I'm all
[34 - 37] dolled up I'm even wearing a party dress
[37 - 39] party dress and I put something in my
[39 - 42] hair it's a hairband and I have makeup
[42 - 43] on which actually feels really
[43 - 44] uncomfortable because I don't really
[44 - 46] wear makeup now because I dismembered
[46 - 48] Thanos all about fun and festivities and
[48 - 50] cake and presents well actually I had no
[50 - 53] fun or festivities plan but I think
[53 - 54] there will be cake and hopefully a
[54 - 57] present or two I have decided to make a
[57 - 59] party hat that's right we are going to
[59 - 61] make a party hat it's arts and crafts
[61 - 63] I'm here at that Colonel Tyson I know
[63 - 66] you all are so excited so without
[66 - 68] further ado let's make a party hat to
[68 - 69] make this project you're gonna need a
[69 - 70] piece of paper
[70 - 72] I chose bread so much is my Percy pretty
[72 - 77] dress and scissors tape glue and
[77 - 79] something to decorate your party hat
[79 - 81] with first you're gonna need to make a
[81 - 84] complete square out of your construction
[84 - 87] paper then you're gonna make your hat
[87 - 89] all you have to do is roll your piece of
[89 - 91] paper into a cone now to do that you
[91 - 96] just roll your paper you're going to
[96 - 101] tape it ever notice how that first piece
[101 - 105] of tape just never feels right now
[105 - 109] you're gonna cut it this paper off I'm
[109 - 111] not the best hat maker and I'm just
[111 - 114] winging it cuz once you have your cowan
[114 - 123] you decorate it
[125 - 125] now I suggest using stickers as well
[125 - 127] especially letter stickers and if you
[127 - 130] were having a birthday party and there
[130 - 131] were a bunch of different kids you could
[131 - 133] put their names on them which is kind of
[133 - 136] cool and certain stickers will add your
[136 - 139] own unique flair to your hat I think
[139 - 140] this is great for birthday parties and
[140 - 142] if I ever have kids it's totally
[142 - 144] something I would do it has some of
[144 - 147] these steampunk ears that I'm going to
[147 - 150] put on my hat okay cool
[150 - 157] Naomi I'm all about being cool
[159 - 159] and now I'm going to put my name on it
[159 - 160] you know so what the other partygoers
[161 - 163] know who I am awesome
[163 - 165] now you just let you have dry for a few
[165 - 170] minutes and of course you have to ensure
[170 - 172] that it was going to stay on your head
[172 - 174] so the best way to do that is to get
[174 - 180] some string or some elastic and thread
[180 - 182] the elastic through for some strange
[182 - 184] reason I cannot find my string and so
[184 - 188] I'm going to use party ribbon and voila
[188 - 191] you have a super awesome personalized
[191 - 195] party hat let me just add my party hat
[195 - 201] onto my head alright here I am what do
[201 - 204] you think I bet you know you will never
[204 - 207] ever buy another party hat because it's
[207 - 210] so simple to make and they look amazing
[210 - 212] talent arts and crafts time is over
[212 - 214] I'm gonna go ahead and say goodbye I
[214 - 215] hope you all have a fabulous day and
[215 - 217] I'll see you all again here next week
[217 - 228] for another edition of back melted and
[228 - 231] then of course you just clean up by
[231 - 234] shoving it all in your desk like this
[234 - 238] and closing it    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[8 - 8] hello and welcome back to the insane
[8 - 10] knitters the YouTube video channel this
[10 - 14] is going to be a demonstration of a flat
[14 - 16] hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a
[16 - 19] lot of hats are knit in the round on a
[19 - 21] cable needle and they they're you know
[21 - 23] you just knit them in a circle and then
[23 - 25] you decrease to the top and you finish
[25 - 27] it that way a flat hat is knit on
[27 - 30] straight needles like this with just a
[30 - 33] large piece of fabric and a lot of
[33 - 35] people make hats this way it does
[35 - 37] involve some seaming and I'll show you
[37 - 41] that but what I'm using here is really
[41 - 43] big needles and really thick yarn this
[43 - 47] is called encore mega and on a size 15
[47 - 48] needle it gives you two stitches per
[48 - 51] inch and that's just something I'm using
[51 - 54] right now and I'll tell you why it makes
[54 - 56] a quick it's a very quick knit just
[56 - 59] quick quick turn it up and it it's very
[59 - 61] thick and you only generally need one
[61 - 64] skein to do this you can use two it
[64 - 67] tells you on the label
[67 - 70] how many yards it is and it's this is
[71 - 73] sixty four yards on and I'm using a
[73 - 76] smaller needle than it calls for so I'm
[76 - 77] getting a little more yardage out of
[77 - 80] this to knit with but that's neither
[80 - 81] here nor there you can use any yarn you
[81 - 83] want for this I'm just using the thick
[83 - 85] yarn and the big needles too to show you
[85 - 88] because it's easier um when you want to
[88 - 90] make a flat hat uh
[90 - 93] like I said you is a thick skein of yarn
[93 - 95] to give me about two stitches per inch
[95 - 98] because it's it's a quick knit and I
[98 - 101] find it easier but you can do this with
[101 - 102] baby yarn you can do this with any yarn
[102 - 105] you want as long as you measure properly
[105 - 107] and that is really the thing you want to
[107 - 110] cast on enough stitches on your needles
[110 - 115] to make the length as high as you want
[115 - 118] the hat to be so if you need the Hat to
[118 - 121] be 10 inches high you know so you've got
[121 - 123] good six inches of coverage on your hat
[123 - 126] then you want to cast on enough stitches
[126 - 131] because this is going to be however
[131 - 134] however why it is is going to be how it
[134 - 138] sits on your head so and then you want
[138 - 141] to knit - however you however long you
[141 - 143] want it to be around generally the most
[143 - 146] average hat is the average person's head
[146 - 149] is about 20 to 22 inches you know the
[149 - 151] kids are obviously smaller than that and
[151 - 153] people come in different sizes so you
[153 - 157] just want to knit as long as you want
[157 - 159] your hat to be around and I'll show you
[159 - 163] why what I have done here is I've knit
[163 - 165] to the point to where I want to bind off
[165 - 168] okay I think this is about 12 inches so
[168 - 170] it's going to make a small hat and now
[170 - 172] I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go
[172 - 173] ahead and do that and I'll come back in
[173 - 175] a minute when I'm bound off and I'll
[175 - 177] show you what and we're back
[177 - 179] okay I have bound off this piece of
[179 - 182] fabric to the last stitch and I'll show
[182 - 185] you what to do now
[185 - 188] we've got our last stitch here and you
[188 - 192] want to finish that up no but you want
[193 - 194] it the thing is is we're going to seam
[194 - 196] this now so you want to instead of just
[196 - 198] cutting this off really close and
[198 - 200] binding it off that way you want to
[200 - 205] leave a long piece long piece of tail
[205 - 206] yarn here because we're going to use
[206 - 210] this piece to sew up the Hat so you want
[210 - 213] to leave really long tail to sew with so
[213 - 217] okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much
[217 - 224] okay and then we're gonna cut this
[226 - 226] and then we're gonna pull it through
[226 - 229] okay so there we go that's our last
[229 - 231] stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn
[231 - 234] through and we're gonna there we go now
[234 - 236] we're bound off completely here okay
[236 - 239] there we go now this is the piece of
[239 - 243] fabric that I knitted and what we're
[243 - 246] going to do is we're going to take a
[246 - 250] yarn needle if you don't have a yarn
[250 - 253] needle they come in various kinds this
[253 - 255] is a large one so because I'm using
[255 - 262] really big yarn here this is the piece I
[262 - 265] knitted okay here's the the cast on edge
[265 - 267] this is where I started knitting and
[268 - 270] then I knit it however long I want my
[270 - 273] hat to be generally this one's about 12
[273 - 278] inches and but you know like I said
[278 - 282] normally you'd knit however long two to
[282 - 284] make it or whoever you're knitting it
[284 - 287] for measuring heads is kind of weird but
[287 - 291] you can do it just you know or you can
[291 - 292] take your best guess like I said the
[292 - 295] average hat the average size is about 20
[295 - 299] to 22 inches depending on on the person
[299 - 303] you're knitting for so here's our our
[303 - 305] cast on edge this is where we started
[305 - 307] Inc this is our cast off edge where we
[307 - 309] stop knitting and this is what we're
[309 - 313] going to do we're going to sew the cast
[313 - 314] on edge
[314 - 317] to the cast-off edge the bind off and
[317 - 320] the bind on we're going to sew those
[320 - 321] together and you're going to end up with
[321 - 324] this two looking thing okay like that so
[324 - 327] you want to take your really long tail
[327 - 330] that you left you also can use another
[330 - 334] piece of yarn to do this you know just
[334 - 336] if you want you can use a different size
[336 - 339] of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I
[339 - 341] used to sew the Hat so that way it
[341 - 347] doesn't show if it gets pulled apart
[347 - 348] okay so here we are we have our yarn
[348 - 353] needle and our yarn and we're going to
[353 - 357] sew these edges together now you can see
[357 - 359] here where your yarn where you bound off
[359 - 361] right there and then you can see the
[361 - 364] edge over here so I generally oh and
[364 - 365] then that's another thing to see this
[365 - 366] pattern I just this is garter stitch
[366 - 368] it's just all knit stitches it's nice
[368 - 370] for hats it's thick it's comfortable but
[370 - 372] you can use any pattern you want you
[372 - 374] don't have to be you don't have to use
[374 - 375] garter stitch I know someone who does
[376 - 377] these in ribbing you can do it every
[377 - 381] pattern you want just remember that one
[381 - 383] side will be inside on the person's head
[383 - 385] and the other side will be on the
[385 - 387] outside so just keep that in mind with
[387 - 389] your pattern but this is just simple
[389 - 390] garter stitch it's all it's knit every
[390 - 392] row just because it works for
[392 - 395] demonstration purposes and also it helps
[395 - 399] me line up what I'm doing here so see
[399 - 400] there's I'm lining up the little rows
[400 - 404] there and now you just take your yarn
[404 - 411] needle and you pick up in between the
[411 - 413] bind off stitches there's these little
[413 - 417] ladders see those right in between each
[417 - 420] of these stitches you can go in and pick
[420 - 423] up that little that little ladder inside
[423 - 426] in it and that really helps you a lot
[426 - 428] when you're sewing and so what we're
[428 - 431] going to do is just seam all the way
[431 - 433] across or I'll show you a couple
[433 - 435] stitches how I do it there's lots of
[435 - 438] ways to do this but this is how I do it
[438 - 441] and so I just come over and I pick up
[441 - 446] the corner first just to secure that
[446 - 452] just to secure them together okay so now
[452 - 454] they're there they're secured they're
[454 - 457] sewn together and then I come in and I
[457 - 463] pick up both sides sorry I bump the
[463 - 465] camera pick up both sides of this stitch
[465 - 470] and both sides of this one and pull that
[470 - 474] through there we go that's sewn together
[474 - 476] this making a flat hat does make a big
[476 - 479] seam down the side and that can be
[479 - 480] uncomfortable for some people when they
[480 - 485] wear stuff but it's just a side effect
[485 - 487] of what this pattern you know of making
[487 - 490] a flat hat so and then that's it I just
[490 - 493] go back and forth I cut this is called
[493 - 495] kind of a whip stitch you just go back
[495 - 500] and forth and sew it up all the way up
[500 - 502] up the sides and you want to make sure
[502 - 506] that you get just about every stitch so
[506 - 510] that way you don't have big holes when
[510 - 514] you when the person puts this hat on so
[514 - 517] see I'm picking up both legs of this
[517 - 520] stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm
[520 - 526] just coming through just like this okay
[526 - 528] and you see how that's being seamed
[528 - 531] together there it's making this little
[531 - 535] making this little line down there down
[535 - 537] the Knitting I'll show you what to do
[537 - 546] with that in a minute so there we go
[548 - 548] see that's another reason I like to use
[548 - 551] the same color of yarn because this way
[551 - 557] it doesn't show very very much
[559 - 559] see when you can tell there's a scene
[559 - 561] there but you can't really see where the
[561 - 564] yarn is because I use the same yarn now
[564 - 565] if I used a different color you could
[565 - 569] really see so pick up both legs of that
[569 - 573] stitch and both legs of the next one and
[573 - 576] come come through
[576 - 579] and I will see you in a minute when I
[579 - 581] get this seemed up in Italy
[581 - 583] okay I'm back I've got this all seem
[583 - 586] down the side now okay
[586 - 587] so now I have this tube see this tube
[587 - 590] thing it's a it's like a it's a tube
[590 - 594] okay and it's not a hat yet but it will
[594 - 596] be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last
[596 - 600] stitch here just like that this is a
[600 - 602] little tail where we started to knit
[602 - 605] remember now this is the part where you
[605 - 607] make your hat okay you're going to
[607 - 611] basically stitch up one of the one of
[611 - 615] the sides here and that's going to close
[615 - 618] one end of the tube and kind of make a
[618 - 621] little hat shape like this okay like
[621 - 623] that so it doesn't look like a hat now
[623 - 625] but when I get this all sewn and I pull
[625 - 628] it really tight it'll make a little hat
[628 - 630] like that and you said you know it's not
[630 - 632] the prettiest thing in the world but it
[632 - 634] does work very well and then you can
[634 - 638] fold this up and and you have a hat for
[638 - 642] whomever you're making it for this is
[642 - 646] the part where their head goes in there
[646 - 649] you go you can fold that up and there's
[649 - 651] the top of the hat so that's how you
[651 - 653] make a flat hat so let's go I'll come
[653 - 655] back just a minute when I get this top
[655 - 658] zone and it's over the top you're going
[658 - 660] to instead of going back and forth like
[660 - 663] we did with this loose with the whip
[663 - 665] stitching you're kind of going to do the
[665 - 667] same thing only you do it on both sides
[668 - 670] so there's where I came out so I'm going
[670 - 673] to go in here like that
[673 - 675] pick up that because this is a different
[675 - 677] edge so it's going to look a little a
[677 - 680] little different because this is a side
[680 - 682] now instead of the bind off edge so
[682 - 684] you're going to go so you came out here
[684 - 686] and then you're going to go back on this
[686 - 689] side and over here like that you make in
[689 - 692] kind of a criss cross one two three four
[692 - 693] instead of going back and forth like
[693 - 698] that so you just go just like this and
[698 - 700] I'll see you in just a second when I get
[700 - 701] this done
[701 - 703] okay I've reached the last stitch now
[703 - 705] and these these are all stitched and I
[705 - 706] went back and forth back and forth and
[706 - 708] now I'm at the last stitch I'm going to
[708 - 711] pull it through and you didn't you don't
[711 - 712] want to seen this too tightly because
[712 - 714] this is what you're going to do now now
[714 - 717] you're gonna pull see you pull that
[717 - 719] really tight like that and see how it
[719 - 722] squishes like that okay you pull it
[722 - 723] really tight and then what I do is I
[723 - 727] take my needle and I just kind of wedge
[727 - 731] it through again just just because guess
[731 - 734] that little gives it a little extra
[734 - 738] tightening okay just like that and you
[738 - 740] can do it again if you want just to use
[740 - 743] up some of the slack on your on your
[743 - 745] needle there or some of the extra yarn
[745 - 748] okay there you go and you know one more
[748 - 752] time why not we're here so there you go
[752 - 755] you pull it tight now you weave in your
[755 - 760] ends
[762 - 762] there's an end and then you pull it
[762 - 765] inside out and there you go you have a
[765 - 770] hat here just a flat hat
[775 - 775] tada you made a hat yay Congrats
[775 - 778] here's your flat head with your ins bulb
[778 - 781] in and there's the broom you can roll it
[781 - 782] up or they can just wear it straight
[782 - 785] they want but there it is
[785 - 789] and that's what the top looks like
[790 - 790] like I said it's not the prettiest thing
[790 - 792] in the world but it's good it's
[792 - 793] functional and you can use whatever
[793 - 798] pattern you want and in it however you
[798 - 798] like
[798 - 802] there you go but    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[4 - 4] all right okay a nother paper hell - now
[4 - 7] we're going to be making a paper hat and
[7 - 11] do so you will first need to fold the
[11 - 19] paper in half doesn't have to be too
[19 - 25] accurate fold it in half now this bit
[25 - 29] you have to fold over the top half okay
[29 - 34] so that's the middle of the paper you
[34 - 37] can fold it in half gainer sheep just to
[37 - 41] make 9 down the middle that you can see
[41 - 42] okay
[42 - 48] so fold over these top these top pieces
[48 - 56] okay it like you would a paper airplane
[56 - 71] I guess to make this paper hat and it's
[72 - 76] quite a simple thing paper they go what
[76 - 81] more do you need to do opens up how I
[81 - 85] fill it with chips or whatever if you
[85 - 89] want make it look a little neater you
[89 - 101] can fold in these corner pieces and do
[101 - 111] the same on the other side and then
[111 - 116] triangle isn't your style you can then
[116 - 119] fold it down
[119 - 124] and push it in to the little flap there
[124 - 128] and then you have more of a boat shape
[128 - 131] and if you want to make a paper boat
[131 - 134] make a paper boat call it paper boat say
[134 - 136] that's paper foam instead of paper paper
[136 - 142] boat paper paper boat and it also
[142 - 144] doubles up a third thing you put out
[144 - 149] just fold in one of the corners

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[11 - 11] you can use the technique I'm going to
[11 - 15] show you to make a top hat of any size I
[15 - 19] used a cardboard tube but you can use
[19 - 23] construction paper our poster board are
[23 - 26] any material that is stiff enough now I
[26 - 31] started by drawing around the cardboard
[31 - 38] tube at the bottom then I added some
[38 - 44] tabs so that I can glue it onto the two
[44 - 53] after I cut it out it looks like this i
[66 - 66] i glue them on first so later I can
[66 - 71] cover up the tabs takes a few minutes
[71 - 81] sometimes for the glue to dry
[84 - 84] and while we're waiting for that I drew
[84 - 87] around the bottom the same way i placed
[87 - 93] the tube and it's drew a circle around
[93 - 98] it then for the brim I drew a bigger
[98 - 108] circle around that
[111 - 111] and I cut the circle out and in the
[111 - 116] middle I just made a big X I'll show you
[116 - 121] I made a big X like this and I cut on
[121 - 126] those lines so that it looks like that
[126 - 132] did I bending up and the glue goes on
[132 - 140] the inside of these little triangles so
[140 - 143] that you can I mean I'm sorry little bit
[143 - 147] outside because they're going to be
[147 - 153] placed on the inside of the tube put
[153 - 158] those in take your finger and press them
[158 - 164] so that they blew on then the next thing
[164 - 169] idea that I measured this the tube and I
[169 - 172] r is a paper around it to cover it up
[172 - 176] next I cut the little band and it's just
[176 - 178] a little rectangle and you can make it
[178 - 180] as wide or as narrow as you want and
[180 - 184] then I cut strips to make the stripes
[184 - 187] and I put those on before I glued the
[187 - 190] bad don't and i added stars and glitter
[190 - 193] you may not want to but it's up to you
[193 - 195] it sure as you can make it any way you
[195 - 198] want now thanks for watching remember
[198 - 201] always be kind and please click the
[201 - 204] subscribe button    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of segment labels for temporal segmentation of the tutorial based on Purposes (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing labels).

### GUIDELINES FOR SEGMENTATION:
- Label as General when the instruction is neutral and aimed at any viewer without audience-specific references.
- Label as Party when the content addresses making multiple hats, personalization for events, or group activities.
- Label as Personal when the speaker offers subjective comments, anecdotes, or future-intent remarks about themselves.
- Label as Aesthetic when the content focuses on visual effects, styling, or decorative choices.
- Label as Practical when the content gives functional advice (making things durable, hiding print, improving structure).
- Choose the label that best captures the stated reason or intended audience for the instruction; default to General if no intent is specified.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one segment label; keep the existing labels as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new segment label if the transcript contains a segment that is not covered by any existing segment label.

### PROCEDURE
1) Segment the transcript temporally following the segmentation guidelines.
2) For each segment:
    - Try to map it to an existing segment label.
    - If no existing segment label fits, propose a new segment label following the guidelines.
3) For every segment label in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that would be labeled as the segment label)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a segment label is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of segment labels. Each segment label should have the following fields:
- id: id of the segment label
- label: short text less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the segment label means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the segment label

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping segment labels.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[1] Greeting: guys today I'm going to be showing you how to make a paper hat.
[2] Overview Goal: The video will show how to make a paper hat.
[3] Suggestion: Before following the video, consider watching the whole video first.
[4] Advice: Use a bigger piece of paper than the one shown for a larger hat.
[5] Explanation Effect: Using a small piece of paper makes a small hat that may not fit on the head.
[6] Transition Bridge: So let's get started.
[7] Instruction: Hold the paper and make sure the crease is good.
[8] Instruction: Ensure the paper is creased well by pressing the fold firmly.
[9] Instruction: Turn the paper to the crease side so the crease is at the bottom.
[10] Instruction: Fold the bottom up to the crease.
[11] Instruction: Hold the paper steady while making a good crease.
[12] Description Status: One corner will have a little space after folding.
[13] Supplementary Tip: A small gap or space in the corner does not matter.
[14] Description Status: The folded paper should look like the displayed example.
[15] Instruction Subgoal: Prepare the body part of the hat for the next fold.
[16] Instruction: Take the first flap only and do not take both flaps together.
[17] Instruction: Lift and fold the selected flap so it looks like the demonstrated shape.
[18] Instruction: Flip the paper over to the other side after folding the flap.
[19] Supplementary Tip: You can use staples to keep parts of the hat together.
[20] Warning: Do not staple in the middle if you want the hat to open properly.
[21] Description Status: The maker reiterated that the hat may be small with the used paper size.
[22] Supplementary Tip: Use a larger piece of paper to make a hat bigger.
[23] Instruction: To make a Robin Hood style hat, fold one side over to the left.
[24] Instruction: Fold the other side the same way to create the Robin Hood hat shape.
[25] Conclusion Outcome: The final folded shape should resemble the demonstrated Robin Hood style hat.
[26] Closing: Please subscribe to this channel and goodbye.

[1] Hi guys welcome back to Origami Twist.
[2] My name is Jenna.
[3] Today's video is meant for people dealing with snow days and bored children as a result of the snow days.
[4] The instructor lives in Australia but is originally from the northeastern United States.
[5] Facebook was full of complaints about many snow days recently.
[6] This project is great for imagination, playing dress-up, and coming up with stories and ideas.
[7] This project helps prevent kids from getting bored.
[8] You do not have to be in a snowy area to do this project.
[9] The project is the classic newspaper paper hat.
[10] You probably already have all the materials necessary to make this project.
[11] All you need is one sheet of newspaper.
[12] If you have a full-size newspaper, fold it in half.
[13] Fold the newspaper in half again until you have a rectangle about the size shown.
[14] Fold one corner in to make a right triangle.
[15] Fold at the middle when making the triangle fold.
[16] Fold the other corner in to make another right triangle.
[17] Fold the second triangle down in the middle.
[18] After folding both corners you will have a long skinny strip along the bottom and two triangles on top.
[19] Fold the bottom flap up onto itself so it meets the bottom of the triangles.
[20] Fold the bottom flap up again.
[21] Turn the paper around and fold the bottom flap up so it meets roughly the bottom of the triangle on that side.
[22] You can estimate where the bottom should meet by looking at the other side.
[23] The folds do not have to be perfect; rough alignment is acceptable.
[24] Fold the rectangle up again so that it matches the other side.
[25] Open the folded paper up to reveal a shape that looks like a captain's hat.
[26] The open hat appears like a captain's hat.
[27] The instructor looked at the screen instead of the camera because she is not used to doing tutorials this way.
[28] The instructor thanks viewers for bearing with her.
[29] The instructor has another couple of videos that work great with this hat; one is called the captain's shirt story that uses the hat as a base.
[30] If viewers are interested in a further fold turning the hat into the captain's shirt story, the instructor will make videos on it if asked.
[31] Viewers should leave requests or comments below if they want the captain's shirt story or other ideas.
[32] Thank you for watching.
[33] Please subscribe if you enjoy paper crafting.
[34] The instructor hopes viewers have a fabulous day and says goodbye.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Winston, you want to show everyone how to make a nurse hat?
[2] No, you want to play with the container camera.
[3] Today I'm going to show you how to make a really cute little nurse hat.
[4] I made these nurse hats for my friend's bachelorette party.
[5] Making the nurse hats was super fun and super easy.
[6] Start with a square piece of paper.
[7] Use a square about 21.5 centimeters (about eight inches).
[8] A square's both sides are the same length.
[9] Cut two slits at the top of the square.
[10] Estimate slit length; around three inches (about seven centimeters) is fine.
[11] Exact slit size is not critical for this craft.
[12] Cut the three slits with scissors.
[13] Fold the two cut sections so their edges match neatly.
[14] Match the folded edges so they line up nicely.
[15] Use tape to secure the matched edges.
[16] The instructor made many hats, so she used a fast method to assemble them.
[17] Hold the folded edges together after taping them.
[18] After holding the edges, you will have a shape like a small peaked cap.
[19] Take the top part and fold it over the other two parts.
[20] Use tape to secure the folded top part.
[21] After taping, you will have a sheet shaped like a hat front.
[22] Stuff a little flat cross on the top of the hat.
[23] Pull the hat and fold it again to determine the final hat shape.
[24] Fold small sections on the sides to create side folds for a cap shape.
[25] When placing the hat on the head, make small bends at the edges so the hat sits like a little cap.
[26] Bend the edges slightly to create a little peak so the hat fits as a cap.
[27] After making the little edge folds, fold the hat back up a bit to finish the shape.
[28] These nurse hats fit on heads very well.
[29] Secure the hat in hair with bobby pins placed at the back.
[30] Bobby pins keep the hat in place on the head.
[31] If desired, add decorative material such as a colored strip to the hat for contrast.
[32] The instructor chose a black strip for one hat and white for the bride's hat.
[33] The instructor used regular tape to attach fabric or material because she did not have many crafting supplies.
[34] Attach the decorative material to the hat with tape and affix it at the back so it shows out the back of the hat.
[35] Layer a few strips of tape when attaching decorations to ensure they stay in place.
[36] One person had a black hat and a white veil to coordinate the bride's look.
[37] The hats were funny, cute, easy, and everyone loved them.
[38] Everyone loved the nurse hats at the event.
[39] Do you like that, Winston?

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Hey guys, Bill here.
[2] Today we're going to be making paper hats.
[3] I have already made one paper hat to show what the finished hat should look like.
[4] This is what a finished themed paper hat looks like.
[5] I will demonstrate the paper hat folding step by step.
[6] You can use any type of paper you want to make the hat.
[7] You can use newspaper as the paper for the hat.
[8] The first thing you need to do is make sure the paper is completely flat on the edges.
[9] Flatten the paper so the edges are especially even on the side that will become the front of the hat.
[10] Avoid having the paper bumpy because bumps interfere with folding.
[11] Make sure the paper is very flat on this side so the hat will fold correctly.
[12] Fold the paper in half vertically.
[13] Fold the paper in half again.
[14] Fold the paper like this (demonstration of the half fold).
[15] Make sure the folded edge is perfectly aligned and not off the edge.
[16] Adjust the fold so the edges are exactly even.
[17] Press down on the fold to flatten it.
[18] Ensure the paper flutters down evenly after folding.
[19] Press the crease firmly to remove the rest of the air and secure the fold.
[20] Unfold the paper to reveal the crease made for the next step.
[21] Fold the paper back out to create a reference crease.
[22] The crease gives us a center line for the paper.
[23] Fold the top corners of the paper down toward the center crease.
[24] Make sure each corner meets the middle so the corner is right on target.
[25] Align the top corner exactly at the middle of the paper.
[26] Ensure the top folds are even so the hat looks symmetrical.
[27] Fold both top corners down as much as possible toward the center crease.
[28] Fold the paper so that the top corners touch the center crease.
[29] The fold should meet the center crease in the middle of the paper.
[30] Fold the right side corner to the middle crease.
[31] Fold the right side straight to the middle so it connects cleanly to the center.
[32] Make sure the folded corner is connected and flush with the middle crease.
[33] Flatten the folded sections down firmly.
[34] Fold up only the bottom part of the paper once.
[35] Leave a bottom flap at the base of the folded triangle.
[36] Fold the bottom flap up to the base of the triangle.
[37] Flatten the bottom flap down firmly after folding it up.
[38] Make sure the triangular flaps remain folded down and secure.
[39] Fold one side of the bottom flap over so the hat has a folded edge on that side.
[40] Ensure the folded side is perfectly flat.
[41] Repeat the same folding on the opposite side so both sides match exactly.
[42] Fold the other side in half to mirror the first side's folds.
[43] Bring the other side over and fold it the same way to keep symmetry.
[44] Fold the side straight and make sure it is aligned.
[45] Fold the edge again to secure the alignment.
[46] Make sure the new fold is in line with the other folded edge.
[47] Open the hat up by unfolding the bottom slightly so it forms the hat shape.
[48] Open the hat fully so it takes on the proper hat form.
[49] You should now have a basic paper hat formed.
[50] Optionally, curl the brim of the paper hat inward to change it into a pirate-style hat.
[51] Quickly curl the edges to alter the hat shape.
[52] You can turn the paper hat into a pirate hat by curling the brim inward.
[53] Decorate or stick anything onto the hat to customize it.
[54] Personalize the hat any way you want.
[55] If you enjoyed this video and want more videos like this, please like the video.
[56] If you enjoyed this video and want more videos like this, please subscribe.
[57] I'll see you in the next video.
[58] Right place (closing remark).

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Stages (i.e., Divide the transcript into ordered temporal steps of the hat-making process. Assign each transcript piece to the stage it primarily describes: Preparation (planning, gathering materials, orientation), Construction (step-by-step physical building and folding), or Finishing (final touches, decoration, drying, closing remarks).).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Planning and gathering materials, sizing and orienting participants before hands-on making begins.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: show you to make a top hat of any size
	- Context 1: you can use the technique I'm going to show you to make a top hat of any size I
	- Content 2: used a cardboard tube but you can use
	- Context 2: show you to make a top hat of any size I used a cardboard tube but you can use construction
```
[S2] Construction
Definition: Active building steps: cutting, drawing templates, folding, gluing, assembling and shaping the hat.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I started by drawing around the cardboard tube at the bottom
	- Context 1: any material that is stiff enough now I started by drawing around the cardboard tube at the bottom then I
	- Content 2: I made a big X like this and I cut on those lines
	- Context 2: and in the middle I just made a big X I'll show you I made a big X like this and I cut on those lines
```
[S3] Finishing
Definition: Final touches, decorating, drying, presentation, or closing remarks after the core construction is complete.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: i added stars and glitter
	- Context 1: and I put those on before I glued the bad don't and i added stars and glitter you may not want to

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Today we're going to make hats.
[2] I took off my hat.
[3] Take off your hat.
[4] We're going to make hats out of newspaper.
[5] All you need is newspaper.
[6] Take one sheet of newspaper.
[7] Use one sheet while you're there.
[8] Do not read the newspaper; make hats instead.
[9] We are making hats, not reading.
[10] A newspaper is usually already folded, so leave the newspaper folded.
[11] Leave the newspaper folded just like this.
[12] Fold the newspaper in half hamburger style (wider fold).
[13] Make a crease right down the middle of the folded newspaper.
[14] The crease does not have to be perfect.
[15] You should have a visible crease in the middle.
[16] Fold the top two corners down where the fold is.
[17] Fold the corners down so they meet along the center crease.
[18] Fold both top corners on the same side.
[19] The folded paper should look like a triangular-front shape with an open bottom.
[20] The bottom of the folded triangular shape should be kind of open.
[21] Locate the bottom edge of the folded triangles where there appear to be two sheets of paper.
[22] Fold up the first (outer) sheet of paper along the bottom edge.
[23] Pull the outer sheet up all the way so it looks like a thick crease (hot dog style).
[24] The folded-up side should look like the triangles' base folded up.
[25] Flip the paper over to the back side.
[26] Size the hat by folding the side panels inward to fit the head.
[27] Fold the sides in more for a smaller head.
[28] Fold the sides in a couple of inches for a smaller head.
[29] Fold the sides in just a little bit for a bigger head.
[30] Fold the other side up and in the same way and make a nice crease.
[31] Hold the folded sides so they do not flap out.
[32] The back of the hat should look like folded sides held together.
[33] On the front side, fold the bottom edge up.
[34] Fold the front bottom edge up so the front and back folds are on opposite sides.
[35] Leave a little space in the middle as the base where the head goes.
[36] Pop out the folded hat slightly so it fits around the head.
[37] The completed hat should fit the head when adjusted properly.
[38] You can orient the hat whichever way you want (front facing either direction).
[39] You can put small things in the little room in the brim.
[40] Decorate the hat by having things hang out of the brim.
[41] Decorate your hats.
[42] Add decorations to make funny hats.
[43] Stick a googly eye on the hat.
[44] Add multiple googly eyes to the hat.
[45] After adding googly eyes, the hat will have eyes.
[46] That is our crafty mid-cross craft.
[47] Alright by the way that is our crafty mid cross craft.

### GOAL
For each piece, assign exactly one segment label from the provided labels.
If no segment label clearly apply, assign the empty string "".

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos about How to Make a Paper Hat.
ROLE: user

You are performing temporal segmentation of a tutorial based on Stages (i.e., Divide the transcript into ordered temporal steps of the hat-making process. Assign each transcript piece to the stage it primarily describes: Preparation (planning, gathering materials, orientation), Construction (step-by-step physical building and folding), or Finishing (final touches, decoration, drying, closing remarks).).

### INPUTS
- Canonical segment labels (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[S1] ..."):
[S1] Preparation
Definition: Planning and gathering materials, sizing and orienting participants before hands-on making begins.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: show you to make a top hat of any size
	- Context 1: you can use the technique I'm going to show you to make a top hat of any size I
	- Content 2: used a cardboard tube but you can use
	- Context 2: show you to make a top hat of any size I used a cardboard tube but you can use construction
```
[S2] Construction
Definition: Active building steps: cutting, drawing templates, folding, gluing, assembling and shaping the hat.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I started by drawing around the cardboard tube at the bottom
	- Context 1: any material that is stiff enough now I started by drawing around the cardboard tube at the bottom then I
	- Content 2: I made a big X like this and I cut on those lines
	- Context 2: and in the middle I just made a big X I'll show you I made a big X like this and I cut on those lines
```
[S3] Finishing
Definition: Final touches, decorating, drying, presentation, or closing remarks after the core construction is complete.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: i added stars and glitter
	- Context 1: and I put those on before I glued the bad don't and i added stars and glitter you may not want to
	- Content 2: thanks for watching remember always be kind
	- Context 2: it sure as you can make it any way you want now thanks for watching remember always be kind and please click the

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] Hey everybody this is gonna be a tutorial on how to make a paper hat.
[2] Draw three shapes as the first step.
[3] Make the first drawn shape with a curve on one side.
[4] Make the second drawn shape a little less curved and with a small slant going up.
[5] Make the second drawn shape with a small slit.
[6] Make the third drawn shape the smallest and least curved on the edge.
[7] Cut out each drawn shape after drawing them.
[8] You will have three cut-out pieces after cutting the shapes.
[9] Place one cut-out shape on a white piece of paper and trace around it.
[10] Make two copies of each shape by tracing because you need two of each shape.
[11] Ensure each traced shape is the same size as the original shape.
[12] If the shapes are not the same size the hat will not fit together correctly.
[13] Cut out all the traced shapes with scissors after tracing them.
[14] Color the cut-out shapes if desired at this stage.
[15] Draw lines around the edge of one cut-out to represent seams.
[16] Use dotted lines instead of solid lines for seam marks if preferred.
[17] Draw seam lines for every cut-out piece.
[18] For the two largest pieces make sure the slant on one goes down on one side and up on the other side like a mirror image.
[19] Arrange and check the drawn pieces to confirm the slants are mirror images before assembly.
[20] Take the two matching pieces, put tape on the back, and put them together.
[21] Start assembling the hat by taping pieces together at the back.
[22] Add another piece of tape to the back and attach the next pieces together.
[23] Repeat taping for each piece during assembly.
[24] Do not tape too close to the top because the hat may not fit together correctly.
[25] Leave enough room when taping so adjustments can be made if needed.
[26] Attach one of the smallest pieces to one side of the hat.
[27] Attach the other smallest piece to the opposite side of the hat.
[28] Place the smallest pieces symmetrically on each side because symmetry is required.
[29] Follow the specified order when attaching pieces to ensure the hat assembles correctly.
[30] Attach the remaining small piece to the other side.
[31] For the two largest pieces ensure the slants go in opposite directions like a mirror image when attaching them.
[32] Be careful when aligning the slants on the largest pieces.
[33] Continue taping on the back and putting pieces together as before for the largest pieces.
[34] Make sure the slants on attached pieces continue to face opposite directions.
[35] Expect the two last pieces to be the most difficult to fit together because the area is crowded when forming the circular shape.
[36] If assembly is difficult, keep taping on the back and press the pieces together to work around tight areas.
[37] A gap at the top of the hat is acceptable.
[38] Do not worry about small leftover pieces of tape during assembly.
[39] If extra tape is sticking out, cut off the extra tape with scissors.
[40] Do not worry about the gap at the top because it will be covered later.
[41] Take thin cardboard to make reinforcement pieces for the hat.
[42] You can use any thin cardboard such as Ritz cracker box cardboard.
[43] Cut about six cardboard tabs for reinforcement, though four tabs are usually sufficient.
[44] Keep extra cardboard tabs as backups in case of mistakes.
[45] Bend the cardboard tabs to make them easier to fit when taping them inside the hat.
[46] Place the cardboard tabs inside the hat and tape around them to reinforce the hat.
[47] Taping around the entire hat makes the hat more sturdy.
[48] Taping around the hat gives the hat a round shape so it won't crumble when worn.
[49] Continue taping around the top and bottom of the hat and ensure the taped parts are secure so they won't fall off.
[50] You may be able to see through the white hat to the cardboard, and that is fine.
[51] If the hat is colored on the inside, you probably will not see through to the cardboard.
[52] Make the brim by placing the hat down and drawing a half-circle shape for the brim.
[53] Draw the brim shape lightly in case you need to erase mistakes.
[54] Once satisfied with the brim shape, darken the outline.
[55] Put the hat on and draw a half-circle around the edges to mark brim placement.
[56] Darken the half-moon brim shape after drawing it.
[57] Cut out the brim with scissors after finalizing the drawing.
[58] Color the brim if desired after cutting it out.
[59] Draw seam lines on the brim with a pencil to represent seams.
[60] Optionally draw dotted lines on the brim instead of solid lines.
[61] Stop drawing seam lines short of the very end of the brim and leave that area blank.
[62] Trace around the paper brim onto cardboard to make a stiff brim piece.
[63] It is acceptable if the cardboard for the brim is a little bit too small but ensure it is not too small.
[64] Cut the traced cardboard brim piece out to stiffen the brim.
[65] Glue the cardboard brim piece with glue.
[66] Attach the paper brim to the glued cardboard brim piece.
[67] Flip the brim over after gluing and check for any writing or marks on the cardboard side.
[68] Trace and cut a piece of paper to cover any writing or marks on the cardboard brim.
[69] Place the cut paper over the writing and press it down to hide the marks.
[70] If the marks are still visible through the paper, repeat the process with another layer until they are not visible.
[71] Ensure the shape used to cover the cardboard matches the shape on the hat before taping the brim.
[72] Tape the brim to the bottom of the hat with several pieces of tape and make sure the brim is straight.
[73] Fill gaps by cutting a rectangular piece of paper and gluing it inside the hat.
[74] Pat the glued rectangular paper down inside the hat so you cannot see through anymore.
[75] Make airholes by drawing six circles on paper, shading the centers, and cutting them out.
[76] Glue the bottom of each cut-out circle and paste them onto the hat where airholes are desired.
[77] Make the very top of the hat by cutting a paper strip and forming it into a circular ring.
[78] If the paper strip is too long, trim it to a suitable length before forming the ring.
[79] Cut out a paper circle and glue the circular ring to the circle to form a top piece.
[80] Use a bit more glue than shown if necessary to secure the top piece.
[81] Glue the completed top piece to the top of the hat.
[82] Add logos to the hat using letters, designs, or printed stickers to make it look more realistic.
[83] Print a sticker online, glue the back, and put it on the brim for a more realistic look.
[84] The paper hat is complete.
[85] Message the instructor with any questions and the instructor will answer.
[86] Post a video response with your hat if you want; the instructor would love to see it.
[87] Good luck.

- Pieces of information (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[p12] ..."):
[1] All right, opening remark introducing the project to make a mini paper hat.
[2] The goal is to make a mini paper hat.
[3] Get any size of paper that you would like.
[4] Use a rectangular, palm-sized or hand-sized piece of paper for a small hat.
[5] Fold the paper in half.
[6] Fold the paper in half again.
[7] Make four segments by folding the paper into quarters.
[8] Fold one side but not the other side the same way (create an asymmetrical fold to form segments).
[9] Open the folded paper back up.
[10] Flip the paper into half after opening it up.
[11] Verify that you have eight segments now.
[12] Fold the paper down three folds (one, two, three) sequentially.
[13] Fold the paper up in half.
[14] Repeat folding the remaining four sides in the same way for the rest of the hat.
[15] Fold inwards on the right side (make an inward dish-like fold).
[16] Fold the opposite side inward as well.
[17] Make the same inward fold for the other side of the paper.
[18] Form a hat-like shape by arranging the folded parts into a peaked shape.
[19] Take one folded flap, fold it backward, and tuck it back into the hat structure.
[20] Flip and tuck the other folded flap into place as well.
[21] Cut off excess parts where indicated.
[22] Fold the cut flap to try and fit it into the hat for the same sides.
[23] If there is excess space, adjust the flap placement to make it fit.
[24] Put the folded flap inside the opening (tuck the flap inside the hat).
[25] Repeat tucking the flap on the same side to secure the structure.
[26] Fold and slide the flap parts into place so the hat stays assembled.
[27] Check that the flaps match properly and that the pieces are inside the hat.
[28] Small imperfections on the sides are acceptable and are not an issue.
[29] You have created a mini paper hat.
[30] You can make the hat larger by using bigger paper if you want a bigger hat.
[31] Bigger paper will make a hat that more people can use or display.
[32] Good luck and thanks for watching; closing farewell.
