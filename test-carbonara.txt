The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares. Now, let's just fix that. Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months. It sounds like an overreaction at first, but the crack sends a shock wave through the noodle, rendering it completely inedible. I mean, look, here's uncracked spaghetti and cracked spaghetti.

The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/160.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/161.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/161.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/162.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/163.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/164.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/165.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/166.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/167.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/168.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/169.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/169.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/170.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/171.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/172.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/173.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/174.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/175.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/175.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/176.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/177.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/178.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/179.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/179.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/180.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/181.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/182.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/183.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/184.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/185.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/186.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/187.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/188.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/189.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/190.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/191.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/191.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/192.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/193.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/194.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/195.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/196.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/197.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/198.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/199.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/200.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/201.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/201.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/202.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/203.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/204.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/205.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/206.jpg', 'static/database/75p4UHRIMcU.mp4_frames/207.jpg'], 'content_ids': ['75p4UHRIMcU-44', '75p4UHRIMcU-45', '75p4UHRIMcU-46', '75p4UHRIMcU-47', '75p4UHRIMcU-48', '75p4UHRIMcU-49', '75p4UHRIMcU-50']}]}, {'id': 'segment-e550cece-aad8-4849-a460-6fa919e9150d', 'start': 206.96444787349003, 'finish': 295.1199951171875, 'title': 'Finish and Serve', 'description': 'Finish the dish with additional cheese and pepper, and serve the pasta.', 'text': "Here I'm trying to do that fancy twist thing, but it's not the right tool, and I don't know what I'm doing.

Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged. I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding.

Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/137.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/138.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/138.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/139.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/140.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/141.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/142.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/143.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/144.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/145.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/146.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/147.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/148.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/148.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/149.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/150.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/151.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/152.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/153.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/154.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/155.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/156.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/157.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/158.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/159.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/160.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/161.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/162.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/163.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/163.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/164.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/165.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/166.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/168.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/169.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/170.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/171.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/172.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/173.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/174.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/175.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/176.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/177.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/177.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/178.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/179.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/180.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/181.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/181.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/182.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/183.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/184.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/185.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/185.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/186.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/187.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/188.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/189.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/189.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/190.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/190.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/191.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/192.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/193.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/194.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/195.jpg'], 'content_ids': ['dzyXBU3dIys-25', 'dzyXBU3dIys-26', 'dzyXBU3dIys-27', 'dzyXBU3dIys-28', 'dzyXBU3dIys-29', 'dzyXBU3dIys-30', 'dzyXBU3dIys-31', 'dzyXBU3dIys-32', 'dzyXBU3dIys-33', 'dzyXBU3dIys-34', 'dzyXBU3dIys-35', 'dzyXBU3dIys-36', 'dzyXBU3dIys-37', 'dzyXBU3dIys-38', 'dzyXBU3dIys-39', 'dzyXBU3dIys-40']}]}, {'id': 'segment-a4778c04-58ce-4923-a570-cae2cb89ce61', 'start': 194.58158486986918, 'finish': 255.07090239091355, 'title': 'Render Bacon', 'description': 'Demonstrate how to render the bacon, manage the fat, and prepare it for incorporation into the pasta.', 'text': "As you can see, there's a lot of fat coming out of this bacon.

I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat. So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture. But I don't think I even really need to do this. But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this. Oh, my God. Looks so good. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water. That's going to loosen it up. And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/305.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/305.jpg',
