This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. Hmm. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue.

If you want to really see not carbonara, here's an earlier attempt where I used whole egg, too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great. So are the whims of the food gods. If this was carbonara, you'd have to be careful, because the carbonistic properties are so fragile, that if you put in a single pea, it would no longer be carbonara. It's a mysterious chemical reaction that only Italian scientists understand. I'm craving carbonara, but I don't have guanciale. Should I really even bother? Oh no, will they judge my carbonara? Because I want some cream upon it. Should I eat it in the closet? Oh no, what have I done? I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetablefree. They say it's no game.

Then go ahead and break your bacon into that pan. And what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy. We'll use most of it in the pasta, and then we'll actually use some for garnish, because who doesn't like crispy bacon on top?", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/13.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/14.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/15.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/16.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/17.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/18.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/19.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/20.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/20.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/21.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/22.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/23.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/24.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/25.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/26.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/27.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/28.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/29.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/29.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/30.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/31.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/32.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/32.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/33.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/33.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/34.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/35.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/36.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/37.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/38.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/39.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/40.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/41.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/42.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/43.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/44.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/45.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/46.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/47.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/48.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/49.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/50.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/51.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/51.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/52.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/53.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/54.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/54.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/55.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/56.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/57.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/58.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/59.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/60.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/61.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/61.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/62.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/63.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/64.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/65.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/66.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/67.jpg'], 'content_ids': ['dzyXBU3dIys-4', 'dzyXBU3dIys-5', 'dzyXBU3dIys-6', 'dzyXBU3dIys-7', 'dzyXBU3dIys-8', 'dzyXBU3dIys-9', 'dzyXBU3dIys-10', 'dzyXBU3dIys-11', 'dzyXBU3dIys-12', 'dzyXBU3dIys-13', 'dzyXBU3dIys-14']}]}, {'id': 'segment-308c1eaf-c75c-49fc-bb13-011691f28d43', 'start': 67.10984638194347, 'finish': 85.86580282641995, 'title': 'Prepare Pasta Water', 'description': 'Explain how to properly season the pasta water, considering the saltiness of other ingredients in the dish.', 'text': "Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.

Let that roll. Check it on the bacon. I turned the heat down in the end. Be careful not to overcook this. Looks pretty much perfect. First, I'm going to take some out for garnish. Drain it on a paper towel. Now I'm turning off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so. And then just set that back over there.

It's been 10 minutes. We're just going to use our tongs here. Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat. Turn that pasta water down to a simmer. Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture. The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs. The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right? And don't worry, you're not eating raw eggs. And gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it. Oh, man. And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta. You see how creamy this is? I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat. So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture. But I don't think I even really need to do this. But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this. Oh, my God. Looks so good. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water. That's going to loosen it up.

combine the cooked pasta with the egg and cheese mixture, ensuring the eggs do not scramble, and achieve a creamy consistency.', 'text': "So here we go. It's been 10 minutes. We're just going to use our tongs here. Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat. Turn that pasta water down to a simmer. Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture. The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs. The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right? And don't worry, you're not eating raw eggs. And gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it. Oh, man. And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta. You see how creamy this is? I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat. So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture. But I don't think I even really need to do this. But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this. Oh, my God. Looks so good. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water. That's going to loosen it up. And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/305.jpg', 'static/database/dzyXBU3dIys.mp4_frames/305.jpg',
