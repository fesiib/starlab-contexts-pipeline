So, I'm going to go all the way around, like so, just around the outside edges of the car, giving enough breathing room, so Photoshop can figure out what actually needs to fill in this selection area.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/35.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/36.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/37.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/38.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/39.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/40.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/41.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/42.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/43.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/44.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/45.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/46.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/47.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/48.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/48.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/49.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/50.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/51.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/52.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/53.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/54.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/55.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/56.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/57.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/58.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/58.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/59.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/60.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/61.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/61.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/62.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/63.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/64.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/65.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/66.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/67.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/68.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/68.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/69.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/70.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/71.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/72.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/73.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/74.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/75.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/76.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/76.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/77.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/78.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/79.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/79.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/80.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/81.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/82.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/83.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/84.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/84.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/85.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/86.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/87.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/88.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/89.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/90.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/90.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/91.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/92.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/93.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/94.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/95.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/96.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/97.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/98.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/99.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/99.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/100.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/101.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/102.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/103.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/104.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/105.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/106.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/107.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/108.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/109.jpg'], 'content_ids': ['cTM853qX7cM-4', 'cTM853qX7cM-5', 'cTM853qX7cM-6', 'cTM853qX7cM-7', 'cTM853qX7cM-8', 'cTM853qX7cM-9', 'cTM853qX7cM-10', 'cTM853qX7cM-11', 'cTM853qX7cM-12', 'cTM853qX7cM-13']}]}, {'id': 'segment-cf72204a-9dce-4c80-851f-4d671a316168', 'start': 109.42641661302099, 'finish': 264.0234899328859, 'title': 'Generative Fill', 'description': 'Explain how to use the Generative Fill feature to replace the selected object with new content, and how to choose between different generated variations.

If you don't see this, just go up to Window, and then down here to the Contextual taskbar to reveal it. So, going ahead and clicking on Generative Fill, we'll then go and click Generate without any specific prompt added. Photoshop will take a minute to load the results, and then it will give us three variations here inside of the Properties panel that we can click between to see which option we like the best. Now, this one looks pretty decent, but the post is in a weird area, so I don't really like how that turned out. I don't like the way this curb is looking here either, so we're actually going to regenerate a few different results for us because all three of these didn't really work out in our favor. So, again, I'll go ahead and click on Generate to create a new set of options for us to choose from. Now, as you can see, we have a new row of variations that we can click between to choose something that we like. In this case, this example actually looks pretty good to me, or even this one here is pretty acceptable as well. I think I'm going to opt for this particular one instead. I think it looks the most seamless overall rather than having to regenerate something else for the sake of example. So, now all of those adjustments were applied onto a new generative fill layer that if I turn this on and off, you can see the before and after. So, what has happened here is that it rebuilt our subject's pants that I don't really like, but we'll touch this up in just a moment. But most importantly, it did a great job to fill in all of this detail that was once behind the car. This would be nearly impossible to replicate with any of the previous object removal tools in Photoshop like the Clone Stamp tool or the Remove tool for example. This is like taking things to a totally new level. Now, before we go and touch up the problem areas, I'm also going to go and remove these cars from the background. So, once again, still with the Lasso tool selected, I'll just click and drag around those cars in the background that I want to remove with the same settings as before so that 10 pixel feather antialias is checked. Once again, I'll click on Generative Fill in the contextual taskbar, then click on Generate while that selection is active and Photoshop will take a minute to load and then fill in that active selection area with something new. Now, with that complete, we can click between our variations until we have something that we're happy with. In this case, the second variation looks best to me, so I'm going to select that one here and again, it's on its own generative fill layer. So, now with this complete, we have to go through and touch up any other smaller areas that we would like to remove as well as fix any problems that we have created within our generative fill layers, such as the top of our subject's leg, for example.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/109.jpg', 'static/database/cTM853qX7cM.mp4_frames/110.jpg',

So, going ahead and clicking on Generative Fill, we'll then go and click Generate without any specific prompt added. Photoshop will take a minute to load the results, and then it will give us three variations here inside of the Properties panel that we can click between to see which option we like the best. Now, this one looks pretty decent, but the post is in a weird area, so I don't really like how that turned out. I don't like the way this curb is looking here either, so we're actually going to regenerate a few different results for us because all three of these didn't really work out in our favor. So, again, I'll go ahead and click on Generate to create a new set of options for us to choose from. Now, as you can see, we have a new row of variations that we can click between to choose something that we like. In this case, this example actually looks pretty good to me, or even this one here is pretty acceptable as well. I think I'm going to opt for this particular one instead.

But most importantly, it did a great job to fill in all of this detail that was once behind the car. This would be nearly impossible to replicate with any of the previous object removal tools in Photoshop like the Clone Stamp tool or the Remove tool for example. This is like taking things to a totally new level. Now, before we go and touch up the problem areas, I'm also going to go and remove these cars from the background. So, once again, still with the Lasso tool selected, I'll just click and drag around those cars in the background that I want to remove with the same settings as before so that 10 pixel feather antialias is checked. Once again, I'll click on Generative Fill in the contextual taskbar, then click on Generate while that selection is active and Photoshop will take a minute to load and then fill in that active selection area with something new.

So now the final thing we have to do is touch up our subject's leg because if I zoom in here, you can see how he kind of has like this bent thigh. It looks like he has a broken leg or something. So what we need to do is create a selection of the original leg to restore it and then we need to touch up the outer edges once again. It sounds a bit complicated, but I promise you it's super easy. So holding Alt or Option, I'll click on the eyeball icon beside my image layer so that now I'm only viewing that layer. With that particular image layer selected, I'm going to go and select the Object Selection tool up here in the toolbar. With the mode set to Lasso, I'm going to click and drag around the area that I want to restore which is my subject's leg. So just click and drag just around the outside edges of that leg like so and then it will snap to the edge of that object. Now with this selection active, I'm going to reenable all of my previous layers by clicking and dragging through the eyeball icons to make them visible once again. Now to restore the contents of this selection area, we need to remove it from our generative fill layer that is causing this problem. So clicking on the generative fill layer that is the one that is removing that car and creating the issue with the leg, I'll click on that layer mask while I have this active selection. I'll then grab my brush tool by pressing B and set my foreground color to black. Now with that generative fill layer mask selected, I can just go and paint inside of this selection area and it's going to restore that leg for me. Now, of course, I still have some areas outside of the selection that are showing through from this generative fill layer. So what we're going to do is invert this selection and then mask out these additional problem areas. So within the contextual taskbar, we can just click on the invert selection option and now we're selecting everything outside of our subject's leg. And with that generative fill layer mask still selected, my foreground color is still set to black, I can now go and just mask out any of those other problem areas around my subject's leg. Now it is going to reveal the car back into view because that is what was being removed with the generative fill layer, but we can easily go and refine this using a couple of different tools.",

techniques.', 'text': "If you want to learn more about the Remove tool specifically, you could check out this video right here where I dive deep into how to use that tool. So now the final thing we have to do is touch up our subject's leg because if I zoom in here, you can see how he kind of has like this bent thigh. It looks like he has a broken leg or something. So what we need to do is create a selection of the original leg to restore it and then we need to touch up the outer edges once again. It sounds a bit complicated, but I promise you it's super easy. So holding Alt or Option, I'll click on the eyeball icon beside my image layer so that now I'm only viewing that layer. With that particular image layer selected, I'm going to go and select the Object Selection tool up here in the toolbar. With the mode set to Lasso, I'm going to click and drag around the area that I want to restore which is my subject's leg. So just click and drag just around the outside edges of that leg like so and then it will snap to the edge of that object. Now with this selection active, I'm going to reenable all of my previous layers by clicking and dragging through the eyeball icons to make them visible once again. Now to restore the contents of this selection area, we need to remove it from our generative fill layer that is causing this problem. So clicking on the generative fill layer that is the one that is removing that car and creating the issue with the leg, I'll click on that layer mask while I have this active selection. I'll then grab my brush tool by pressing B and set my foreground color to black. Now with that generative fill layer mask selected, I can just go and paint inside of this selection area and it's going to restore that leg for me. Now, of course, I still have some areas outside of the selection that are showing through from this generative fill layer. So what we're going to do is invert this selection and then mask out these additional problem areas. So within the contextual taskbar, we can just click on the invert selection option and now we're selecting everything outside of our subject's leg. And with that generative fill layer mask still selected, my foreground color is still set to black, I can now go and just mask out any of those other problem areas around my subject's leg. Now it is going to reveal the car back into view because that is what was being removed with the generative fill layer, but we can easily go and refine this using a couple of different tools.",

I'll press enter to commit to those changes and Photoshop will automatically remove that for me. Now for this remaining area between my subject's legs, I'll press command or control D to deselect this and we'll just use another generative fill layer to make our life nice and easy. With the lasso tool selected by pressing L, I'll just create a much smaller and specific selection area around my subject's leg so that Photoshop has an easier time to only remove the things that we don't want and it won't really mess up the edges of his pants that we do want to maintain. So with this selection active, we'll click on generative fill just like before. We'll then click on generate with no specific prompt added to that generative fill adjustment. Once again, we have a few different variations that we can choose between but the first one seems to be my favorite. So I'll just click on that variation to enable it. Now zooming out, you can see that we have successfully removed the car from the photo, the cars in the background, the people from the sidewalk and we have maintained the look of our subject.",

That way, no matter the job, you're always going to have a method to remove your subjects. The first is the quick selection tool, or W. Simply select around the subject or object you want to remove, and Photoshop will select what is inside. This works best with space around it. Second is the lasso tool, or L. This is good if you have a steady hand and for smaller or simple subjects, simply draw around them. If you need to move the canvas whilst you're doing this, hold down left click and hold spacebar at the same time to move the canvas. The polygonal lasso tool, or L, works the same, but with straight lines you click between, and is a little more forgiving if your path is not quite right. You can also hold spacebar to move the canvas. Third, we have the quick mask mode. Hit this button to activate it, then select the paintbrush or hit B. Everything will be painted transparent red, and this shows what we are selecting. Make sure that the hardness is 100, opacity is 100 and flow is 100. You can find these settings in the option bar located at the top of the screen. To adjust your brush size, hold alt, right click and slide left or right to change it. You can also go up to the options panel to change it as well. Now you can paint over your subject. Remember we are making sure, if possible, to leave a little bit of space. When you are finished, hit the quick mask mode button again and your painting will become a selection. We want to invert our selection, so simply press shift, control and I at the same time, and our selection is ready to go. The final method is the pen tool, or P. Simply click to drop a point. When you drop another point, the two will connect. You can hold and drag on your new point to make the line curved. Hold the alt button and press on the middle of the curved point if you want to continue with a straight line instead for your next point. If you don't, the line will continue in its natural curve when you make your next point. This tool has so many options and cool features, so be sure to check out one of Photoshop's other amazing tutorials to learn even more about the pen tool. Once finished, go to paths, control click the path in the box and your path will become a selection.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/WmDG0xp2liA.mp4_frames/18.jpg',

techniques to select the object or subject to be removed from the image.', 'text': "First, we're going to start with some easy to use selection methods. That way, no matter the job, you're always going to have a method to remove your subjects. The first is the quick selection tool, or W. Simply select around the subject or object you want to remove, and Photoshop will select what is inside. This works best with space around it. Second is the lasso tool, or L. This is good if you have a steady hand and for smaller or simple subjects, simply draw around them. If you need to move the canvas whilst you're doing this, hold down left click and hold spacebar at the same time to move the canvas. The polygonal lasso tool, or L, works the same, but with straight lines you click between, and is a little more forgiving if your path is not quite right. You can also hold spacebar to move the canvas. Third, we have the quick mask mode. Hit this button to activate it, then select the paintbrush or hit B. Everything will be painted transparent red, and this shows what we are selecting. Make sure that the hardness is 100, opacity is 100 and flow is 100. You can find these settings in the option bar located at the top of the screen. To adjust your brush size, hold alt, right click and slide left or right to change it. You can also go up to the options panel to change it as well. Now you can paint over your subject. Remember we are making sure, if possible, to leave a little bit of space. When you are finished, hit the quick mask mode button again and your painting will become a selection. We want to invert our selection, so simply press shift, control and I at the same time, and our selection is ready to go. The final method is the pen tool, or P. Simply click to drop a point. When you drop another point, the two will connect. You can hold and drag on your new point to make the line curved. Hold the alt button and press on the middle of the curved point if you want to continue with a straight line instead for your next point. If you don't, the line will continue in its natural curve when you make your next point. This tool has so many options and cool features, so be sure to check out one of Photoshop's other amazing tutorials to learn even more about the pen tool. Once finished, go to paths, control click the path in the box and your path will become a selection.", 'frame_paths': ['static/database/WmDG0xp2liA.mp4_frames/18.jpg',
