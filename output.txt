		- class: supplementary_materials
		- The video aims to provide an authentic recipe for carbonara, emphasizing the importance of using traditional ingredients.
		- The previous video humorously mentions ingredients but does not provide a clear list of essential ingredients for carbonara.

	- Twisting pasta to prevent sticking
		- The video suggests twisting the pasta into the water to prevent it from sticking together.
		- class: supplementary_tips
		- This tip is included to help viewers achieve better results when cooking pasta by preventing it from clumping.
		- The previous video does not mention this technique for preventing pasta from sticking.

	- Cold pan for rendering fat
		- The video instructs to start with a cold pan to render the fat from the guanciale slowly.
		- class: supplementary_instructions
		- Starting with a cold pan allows the fat to render out slowly, enhancing the flavor and texture of the dish.

		- class: supplementary_tips
		- This technique is included to enhance the flavor profile of the dish by using the hotter part of the peppercorn.
		- The previous video does not mention this technique for preparing pepper.

	- Emulsification for creamy sauce
		- The video explains that the creaminess of the sauce comes from emulsifying the pasta water and fat, not from adding cream.
		- class: supplementary_rationale
		- This explanation is included to clarify the traditional method of achieving a creamy texture without using cream.
		- The previous video humorously suggests adding pasta water for hydration but does not explain emulsification for creaminess.

	- Guanciale versus bacon usage
