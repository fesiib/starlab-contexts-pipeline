I Like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional And before the muffins go into the oven you want to make that simple streusel. In a small bowl combine a 1 tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share it, like and subscribe to our channel So you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.

I Like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional And before the muffins go into the oven you want to make that simple streusel. In a small bowl combine a 1 tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share it, like and subscribe to our channel So you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
