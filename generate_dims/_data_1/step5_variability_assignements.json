      "explanation": "The narration provides a specific duration for refrigeration, which is fairly detailed; however, it lacks broader context about the recipe, preparation steps leading up to this point, and what specifically should be refrigerated, making the level of detail neither high nor low."

    "Explanation": {
      "label": "Explanation",
      "value": "Moderate",
      "explanation": "It offers a reason for the refrigeration step ('this helps them rise without overflowing'), which is more than just stating what to do but less than a detailed explanation of the science behind the rising process or why overflowing might be a concern, placing the explanation level at moderate."

      "label": "Personalization",
      "value": "Low",
      "explanation": "The narration sticks to the process without integrating any personal anecdotes, preferences, or variations that could reflect personal experience or style, making it low in personalization."
