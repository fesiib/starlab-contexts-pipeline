      "| Overview - Goal | Preparation | Hat | Plan |  | General | This video is a demonstration of a flat hat. |\n",
      "| Overview - Briefing | Preparation | Hat | Plan | Tool | General | A flat hat is knit on straight needles as a large piece of fabric and then seamed rather than being knit in the round. |\n",
      "| Explanation - Justification | Preparation | Hat | Plan |  | General | Many hats are normally knit in the round and decreased to finish at the top, but a flat hat is knit flat and seamed. |\n",
      "| Method - Tool | Preparation | Materials | Measure | Tool | General | Use very big needles and very thick yarn for a quick knit demonstration. |\n",
      "| Description - Tool Specification | Preparation | Materials | Measure | Tool | General | The yarn used here is Encore Mega on a size 15 needle. |\n",
      "| Description - Tool Specification | Preparation | Materials | Measure |  | General | Encore Mega on a size 15 needle yields about two stitches per inch. |\n",
      "| Explanation - Effect | Preparation | Materials | Plan | Tool | General | Using thicker yarn and bigger needles produces a very quick, thick knit that generally needs only one skein. |\n",
      "| Method - Tool | Preparation | Materials | Measure |  | General | You can use one skein or two skeins depending on the yardage indicated on the yarn label. |\n",
      "| Description - Tool Specification | Preparation | Materials | Measure | Tool | General | The skein used here contains sixty-four yards and the instructor is using a smaller needle than the label calls for to get more yardage out of the skein. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Preparation | Materials | Measure |  | General | You can use any yarn for this pattern as long as you measure properly. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Preparation | Materials | Measure |  | General | Using thick skein to give about two stitches per inch makes the knit quick and easier for demonstration. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Preparation | Materials | Measure |  | General | You can do this flat hat method with baby yarn or any yarn as long as you measure properly. |\n",

      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | General | Use a yarn needle to sew the cast-on edge to the bind-off edge. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Preparation | Materials | Measure | Tool | Practical | Yarn needles come in various kinds; choose a large one for very big yarn. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Manipulate | Tool | General | Identify the cast-on edge (where you started) and the cast-off edge (where you stopped knitting) before seaming. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | General | Align the cast-on edge with the cast-off edge and sew them together so the fabric becomes a tube. |\n",
      "| Method - Tool | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | General | You can use the long tail you left or a separate piece of yarn to seam the hat. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Prefer using the same yarn used for knitting to sew the hat so the seam doesn't show if it gets pulled apart. |\n",
      "| Description - Tool Specification | Preparation | Hat | Plan |  | General | This sample hat uses garter stitch (knit every row) which is thick and comfortable. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Preparation | Hat | Plan |  | Aesthetic | You can use any stitch pattern you want for a flat hat, including ribbing, keeping in mind one side will face inside and one will face outside. |\n",

      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Secure the corner first when starting the seam to hold the edges together. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Pick up both sides (both legs) of matching stitches and pull the yarn through to join them when seaming. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Warning | Construction | Hat | Plan | Tool | Practical | Making a flat hat creates a potentially bulky seam down the side which can be uncomfortable for some wearers. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Use a whip stitch (going back and forth) to sew up the side of the fabric and close the tube. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Make sure to pick up about every stitch when seaming so there are no large holes when the hat is worn. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Pick up both legs of each stitch when seaming to create a neat, secure seam. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Aesthetic | Using the same color yarn as the main piece reduces the visibility of the seam. |\n",
      "| Description - Status | Construction | Hat | Plan |  | General | After sewing the long seam the piece becomes a tube but is not yet a finished hat. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Finish the starting tail stitch and then stitch up one end of the tube to close the top and form the hat shape. |\n",
      "| Explanation - Effect | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | General | Sewing up one end of the tube closes that end and makes the fabric take on a hat shape when tightened. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | General | When you pull the closing stitches tight the closed end will bunch and form the top of the hat. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Warning | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | Do not seam the last closure too tightly before final tightening because you will pull the stitches tight to close the top. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Construction | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | Practical | After pulling the top closed tight, pass the needle through the closure again to add extra tightening if needed. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Finishing | Fold/Flap | Attach | Tool | General | Weave in the loose yarn ends after closing the top of the hat. |\n",
      "| Method - Instruction | Finishing | Fold/Flap | Manipulate | Tool | General | Turn the hat right side out after weaving in ends to finish. |\n",
      "| Supplementary - Tip | Finishing | Hat | Manipulate |  | Aesthetic | You can roll the brim up or leave it straight depending on how the wearer prefers to wear it. |\n",
