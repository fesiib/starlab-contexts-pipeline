Turn off the heat.\nCook spaghetti in the boiling water until slightly al dente, about 10 minutes.\nTransfer the cooked spaghetti to the pan with bacon using tongs, leaving the pasta water in the pot.\nAdd the egg and cheese mixture to the hot spaghetti, stirring gently to coat the pasta without scrambling the eggs.\nIf needed, add a little pasta water to loosen the sauce and achieve a creamy consistency.\nPlate the pasta and garnish with additional grated cheese and crispy bacon."

Today, hang out for a second, and you're gonna learn how to do it right. Let's not waste any time, now let's go! Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured. So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon. And thick cut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.",

That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description.",

WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-4: A knife is used to chop the bacon before cooking. The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-44: The bacon is chopped before being cooked in the pan. Now our bacon is cooked.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-6: Bacon is used instead of guanciale because this is not a traditional carbonara recipe. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-44: Stirring occasionally ensures the bacon is cooked evenly. Now our bacon is cooked.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-45: Turning off the burner and letting the bacon cool prevents overcooking the egg-based sauce later. We're turning the burner off, waiting for this to cool, at least until there's no sizzle left, and a bit longer so we don't overcook the eggbased sauce.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-11: Olive oil is used in the pan when cooking the bacon. I'm doing a tiny bit of olive oil, I don't think it's traditional, but when I'm cooking Italian food, it just feels right.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-12: A paper towel is used to drain the bacon after cooking. Then go ahead and break your bacon into that pan.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-8: The bacon is sliced into thick pieces, about three-quarters of an inch, before cooking. So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.

WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-28: Combine three whole eggs with two egg yolks and whisk them together. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-30: Gradually whisk the grated cheese into the egg mixture until smooth. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-20: Using both Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano achieves a balanced flavor. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-29: Whole eggs and egg yolks provide richness without being overly heavy. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-21: Use the fine setting on a box grater if a cheese grater is unavailable. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-40: Adjust the amount of black pepper according to your taste preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.

WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-47: The video suggests using a spoon or tongs for mixing the ingredients. Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-49: Optionally, put the pan on low heat to thicken the sauce. Then the sauce can go in, and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water, making this nice and creamy.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-86: The egg mixture includes eggs, cheese, and black pepper. Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-88: The outcome is a velvety, fluffy, creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-97: If the sauce doesn't thicken as desired, place the pan over simmering pasta water to gently heat it further. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-90: Be gentle with the pasta to avoid breaking it. And gentle with the pasta.
