I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.\n"

So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon. And thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta. So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\n"

        "text": "#### Parent Subgoal Prepare Ingredients\nHere we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged. I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.\n"

That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.\n"

But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano. Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg. Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.\n"

That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.\n"

The guanciale goes in to the pan and this pan is getting hot. Give the garlic a crack and then put it in the pan. As this starts to sizzle, the fat will just pull out some of that perfume from the garlic. Then there's the black pepper. Get your peppercorns in a pestle and mortar. Crack it. Get a little sieve. This is one of the most important little bits and no one really does it, okay. Honestly, this is the outer skin. This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter. Perfect for a good hot carbonara. The guanciale is getting golden.\n"

That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.\n"

If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.\n"

So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon. And thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta. So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.

        "text": "#### Parent Subgoal Prepare Ingredients\nHere we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged. I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.\n"

        "text": "#### Parent Subgoal Prepare Ingredients\nHi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish. Pasta, cheese, bacon. What's not to love, right? But it's really controversial. I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe. So first up guys, you only need five ingredients. Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork. And as you can see, it's all about the fat. It's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried and it's aged. Of course, it's similar to smoked bacon and you can get some pretty good results actually. But you can see this is quite lean. So try and get them to not cut off the fat because you need it. Or there's pancetta. Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano. Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg. Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.\n"

I'm gonna take a bowl and I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that. So, like 20 grams. Now, we're time sensitive so we're gonna have a little whisk up. We've got dark guanciale. We've got the fat that's come out of it and that's what you want. You want attitude and colour.\n"

So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon. And thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta. So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\n"

I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.\n"

That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style.

That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style.

Since noodles are made of wheat, this is essentially a bacon sandwich, but if you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water, and if you get the kind of spaghetti with dehydrated meatballs, just pull those out and set them aside. Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water making this nice and creamy. The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink. Here I'm trying to do that fancy twist thing, but it's not the right tool, and I don't know what I'm doing.\n"

Too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great. So are the whims of the food gods. If this was carbonara, you'd have to be careful, because the carbonistic properties are so fragile that if you put in a single pea, it would no longer be carbonara. It's a mysterious chemical reaction that only Italian scientists understand. I'm craving carbonara, but I don't have guanciale. Should I really even bother? Oh no, will they judge my carbonara? Because I want some cream upon it. Should I eat it in the closet? Oh no, what have I done? I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetable free. They say it's no game.

I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.\n"

I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.\n"

Just get a little bit of water up on it. Let that roll. Check it on the bacon. I turned the heat down in the end. Be careful not to overcook this. Looks pretty much perfect. First, I'm going to take some out for garnish. Drain it on a paper towel. Now I'm turning off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so. And then just set that back over there. Remember, now, heat is off. This is so important. Okay, and of course, we're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth. It's a myth. Just like MSG is going to give you cancer or whatever. It's just not true, and it serves no purpose. So don't do it. Don't do it, okay? Another thing I want to share with you, there are tons of expensive pasta brands out in the world, but honestly, like, I like these cheap Italian brands, like this one, Giacchecco. I don't know how to say it, but like, I don't know why. I just prefer the cheap one. So if anyone's wondering, this is what I use.\n"

That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.\n"

I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.\n"

I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat. So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture. But I don't think I even really need to do this. But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this. Oh, my God. Looks so good. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water. That's going to loosen it up. And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream. Done.

But it's really controversial. I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe. So first up guys, you only need five ingredients. Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork. And as you can see, it's all about the fat. It's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried and it's aged. Of course, it's similar to smoked bacon and you can get some pretty good results actually. But you can see this is quite lean. So try and get them to not cut off the fat because you need it. Or there's pancetta. Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano. Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg. Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.\n"
